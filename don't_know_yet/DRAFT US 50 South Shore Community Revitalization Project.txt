the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project (project), which is designed to improve the Tahoe Basin’s transportation network while addressing affordable housing, community revitalization, and mobility needs, and contributing to environmental gains. The project has been contemplated in regional and local planning documents for decades and is one of the region’s largest capital improvement projects. As proposed, the project would realign U.S. Highway 50 (US 50), enabling the creation of a pedestrian-oriented, “Main Street” through the middle of the existing tourist core, where the highway is now located. Walking, bicycling, and reliable transit would be attractive and safe transportation options and community gathering places would be available in the tourist core. Commercial core revitalization is intended to increase visitor spending and catalyze, adjacent private construction investment. The project is not only intended to revitalize the South Shore of Lake Tahoe, but would also help implement the adopted Lake Tahoe Regional Plan and Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy by enhancing mobility in support of existing and planned projects, including the:  Nevada Stateline-to-Stateline Bikeway, a shared-use path system that will ultimately extend the length of the Nevada side of the lake;  Harrison Avenue Improvement Project;  US 50 Water Quality and Bicycle and Pedestrian Improvement Project – Ski Run to Trout Creek;  Linear Park Multi-Use Trail;  Van Sickle Bi-State Park;   transit shelter and service improvements; and   proposed, future South Tahoe Greenway share-use path and Lake Tahoe Passenger Ferry Project.  TTD, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA), and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) are the lead agencies preparing a joint environmental document for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project. The environmental document is an environmental impact report (EIR) for TTD pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.) and the State CEQA Guidelines (California Code of Regulations Section 15000 et seq.); an environmental impact statement (EIS) for TRPA pursuant to the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact (Public Law 96-551) and 1980 revision (Compact), Code of Ordinances, and Rules of Procedure; and an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the FHWA pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S. Code [USC] Section 4321-4347), the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations Implementing NEPA (40 Code of Federal Regulation [CFR] Section 1500-1508), and FHWA Environmental Impact and Related Procedures (23 CFR Section 771). TTD is also the project proponent.  S.1 PROJECT LOCATION AND SETTING The project is located along US 50 from approximately 0.25 mile west of Pioneer Trail in South Lake Tahoe, California, to Nevada State Route (SR) 207 in Douglas County, Nevada. Existing US 50, also called Lake Tahoe Boulevard, bisects the tourist core areas of Stateline, Nevada and South Lake Tahoe, California. It is one of the most densely developed areas within the Lake Tahoe Basin. Currently, the majority of traffic moving through the tourist core uses US 50, with increasing numbers of vehicles bypassing the highway and cutting through the existing Rocky Point neighborhood on local roads, west of Heavenly Village Center. Within the project site limits, US 50 is a four-lane arterial with a continuous two-way left-turn median lane that transitions to dedicated left-turn pockets at major intersections. On the western side of the project site, Lake Parkway and Montreal Road (which is the continuation of Lake Parkway to the south from Heavenly Village Way) are two-lane roadways (one lane in each direction). Exhibit S-1 shows the boundaries of the project site, which contains the transportation improvements contemplated in one or more of the project alternatives evaluated in this EIR/EIS/EIS. The study area for this EIR/EIS/EIS (see Exhibit S-1) is a larger area surrounding the project site that is intended to capture the extent of potentially significant environmental impacts that may occur as a result of one or more of the alternatives. It is located between the foot of East Peak on the southeast and the Lake Tahoe shoreline on the north. To the east and west, the study area extends approximately one block beyond the project site boundary. The terrain within the study area slopes gently from the southeast toward the shore of Lake Tahoe. The study area contains the entire tourist core, including the resort-casinos of Stateline and Heavenly Village of South Lake Tahoe; commercial land uses to the east and west along US 50; residential and commercial land uses north of the tourist core; portions of Van Sickle Bi-State Park and adjacent forest; and the Rocky Point neighborhood.  S.2 PURPOSE, NEED, AND OBJECTIVES NEPA requires disclosure of a project’s purpose and need. CEQA requires a description of the basic objectives of a project. TRPA does not have specific requirements for a project to identify the purpose, need, or objectives of the project. This section provides the information necessary to present the purpose and need and basic project objectives of the proposed US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project.  One of TTD’s operating principles is to develop value-added projects for the communities in which they work. In May 2016, consistent with TTD principles and in response to public feedback on the project, the TTD Board adopted project principles that formalize their commitment to providing replacement housing, including deed-restricted affordable and moderate-income housing, for displaced residents. This commitment is reflected in the project objectives below. PURPOSE The overall purposes of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project are described as follows:   improve the corridor in a manner consistent with the Loop Road System concept;   advance multi-modal transportation opportunities;   improve vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle safety;   improve the environmental quality of the area;   reduce traffic congestion;   improve safety for residents, pedestrians, and bicyclists in local neighborhoods;  implement regional and local plans, including the Lake Tahoe Regional Plan and Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy;  enhance visitor and community experience; and  promote the economic vitality of the area.      Exhibit S-1 Project Site and Study Area Location   Need The purposes of the project would fulfill the following specific needs: A. Loop Road System concept. Article V(2) of the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact (Public Law 96-551), 1980 (Compact), requires a transportation plan for the integrated development of a regional system of transportation within the Tahoe Region. The Compact requires the transportation plan to include consideration of the completion of the Loop Road System in the States of California and Nevada. Improvements are required to the corridor to meet the intent of the Loop Road System concept. B. Multimodal mobility and safety. Ongoing and proposed resort redevelopment in the tourist core area has increased pedestrian traffic, creating a need for improved pedestrian safety, mobility, and multi-modal transportation options. Improvements to pedestrian facilities, bicycle lanes, and transit are needed to connect the outlying residential and retail-commercial uses with employment and entertainment facilities, including hotels and gaming interests. Currently, there are no bicycle lanes on US 50 through the project area, and sidewalks are either not large enough to meet the increased demand, or do not exist. These issues adversely affect pedestrian and bicyclist safety and the visitor and community experience of the area. These needs could be addressed through development of a complete street—a street designed and operated to enable safe access for all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and transit riders of all ages and abilities—in the main tourist corridor of the Stateline area. Injury and fatality accident rates for pedestrians and vehicles through the project area are 14 percent above the statewide average rates for the latest three-year period of available data (Caltrans 2016, NDOT 2016). The roadways within the project site also have inadequate facilities for pedestrians, bicyclists, and vehicles. The inadequate facilitates detract from community character and quality of life of both residents and visitors. The poor transportation facilities and pedestrian/bicycle environment create constraints to the economic vitality of the study area (TTD 2013:3). There is a need for enhanced connectivity, transit use, walkability, and bicycle use in the study area to reduce dependence on private automobiles. C. Environmental quality in the area. Environmental improvements are needed in the area to help achieve TRPA’s adopted environmental threshold carrying capacities (thresholds), including for water quality and air quality. Paved roadways are the primary source of the fine sediment particles that are impairing the clarity of Lake Tahoe (Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board [RWQCB] and Nevada Department of Environmental Protection [NDEP] 2010). Improvements to stormwater runoff collection and treatment facilities are needed to meet TRPA, NDEP, and Lahontan RWQCB regulations and requirements for protecting the water quality and clarity of Lake Tahoe. As supported by analysis in the Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan and Sustainable Communities Strategy Final Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement, reduction of vehicle congestion and numbers of vehicles on the roadway through enhanced pedestrian and multi-modal opportunities and opportunities for compact, mixed-use development in the tourist core is needed to provide for a reduction in mobile-source greenhouse gas emissions (TMPO and TRPA 2012:3-57 – 3-61). Landscape improvements are needed to enhance the scenic quality of the project site, to facilitate compliance with TRPA’s scenic thresholds, and to enhance the community and tourism experience. Currently, the three TRPA roadway travel units in the project site (Roadway Travel Unit #32, Casino Core, a portion of Roadway Travel Unit #33, The Strip, and a small portion of Roadway Travel Unit #45, Pioneer Trail [North]) are not in attainment and are targeted for improvement in the Scenic Quality Improvement Plan and other adopted agency plans that apply to the area (TRPA 2016).  D. Minimize congestion. Study area intersections and roadway segments are currently operating at marginally acceptable levels during a typical summer PM peak hour (LOS D) (Wood Rodgers 2016:17); however, higher traffic during holidays, special events, and certain summer and winter peak periods results in long vehicle queues at upstream intersections, long delays throughout the tourist core area, and undesirable traffic operations. The study area is projected to experience substantial increases in traffic congestion in the tourist core in the future that would result in LOS E or worse conditions during normal summer peak hours. E. Neighborhood traffic operations. Neighborhood “cut-through” traffic occurs as drivers seek ways to avoid the congestion during peak periods in the summer and winter months. By avoiding the congested highway, drivers find a faster travel route around the tourist core outside peak periods. Traffic volumes at the study area “gateways” have increased approximately 20 percent since 2011, while traffic within the tourist core area has slightly decreased (Caltrans 2016, NDOT 2016, El Dorado County 2016), indicating that vehicles are using the neighborhood streets to bypass the core. The cut-through vehicles cause congestion in residential neighborhoods and have been observed to travel at high speeds, which endangers local residents and changes the character of the neighborhood. The project is needed to improve safety and operations of local roads through neighborhoods by providing roadway changes that reduce congestion and provide a more efficient travel route in the tourist core area for through traffic.  F. Regional and local plans. The project is needed to implement adopted regional and local plans for the area, including the Lake Tahoe Regional Plan, Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy, Lake Tahoe Environmental Improvement Program, Tourist Core Area Plan, and South Shore Area Plan. The transportation improvements and water quality improvements included in the project are identified in these plans.  G. Redevelopment and revitalization. Another project purpose is to create opportunities for redevelopment and revitalization of the study area. Currently, the study area is more conducive to vehicular travel than other modes, which presents limitations to walkability and bicycle use. Improvements to the existing US 50 through the tourist core to create a safer environment for pedestrian and bicycle travel are needed to make the study area more inviting for residents and visitors to patronize existing businesses. Additionally, a portion of the study area is located within the City of South Lake Tahoe Tourist Core Area Plan (TCAP). One of the guiding principles of the TCAP is to establish a diverse and concentrated mix of uses that create a strong, lively market (City of South Lake Tahoe 2013:4-1), which would help achieve the vision for revitalization of this area. PROJECT OBJECTIVES Recognizing the needs for and fundamental purposes of the project, it would be intended to achieve the following basic project objectives identified by TTD:   reduce overall vehicle delays through improved motor vehicle mobility on the state highway system, including for commercial access and a better resident and visitor experience;  decrease dependence on the use of private automobiles;  reduce the traffic volumes through the tourist core and “cut-through” traffic in adjacent neighborhoods, and develop a “complete street” for all users, including bicyclists, pedestrians, transit, and vehicles;   improve visual and environmental conditions within the tourist core;   improve connectivity, reliability, travel times, and operations of public transportation modes, including increased mobility and safety for bicycles and pedestrians and enhanced public access to Van Sickle Bi-State Park;  make public transportation more effective with better visibility, connectivity, reliability, and travel times;   comply with TRPA regional level-of-service criteria;  facilitate the creation of a safe and walkable district that enhances pedestrian and bicyclist activities and safety and improves the City of South Lake Tahoe’s and Douglas County’s competitiveness with other regional and national tourist destinations;  create gateway and streetscape features that create a sense of place, align with complete streets principles, are reflective of Lake Tahoe’s natural setting, and provide effective way-finding;  provide opportunity for redevelopment and revitalization within the project site;  provide replacement housing for all residential units acquired for highway right-of-way purposes before groundbreaking for transportation improvements; and  result in no net loss of housing in the South Shore area. S.3 SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF ALTERNATIVES Five project alternatives are under consideration for implementation, consisting of four build alternatives (Alternatives B, C, D, and E) and one no-build alternative (Alternative A). Three build alternatives (Alternatives B through D) would realign existing US 50 from a point just west of the Pioneer Trail/US 50 intersection in California to the point where Lake Parkway meets US 50 in Nevada. By doing so, existing US 50 would be converted to a thriving “Main Street,” a key objective of the project. In addition to the highway realignment, all of the realignment alternatives (Alternatives B through D) would also include a new pedestrian bridge over realigned US 50 providing a new walking and bicycling connection between the tourist core and Van Sickle Bi-State Park, enhanced bicycle and pedestrian facilities and connectivity, enhanced transit features, environmental improvements, replacement housing and relocation assistance for residents and businesses that would be displaced by realigned highway construction, and the potential for new mixed-use developments within the study area that could accommodate those that would be displaced. One build alternative (Alternative E) would construct a raised pedestrian walkway over existing US 50 alignment within the portion of the tourist core between the resort-casinos, rather than realign the highway.  Alternative A: No Build (No Project or No Action) Main Street Concept Illustration With Alternative A there would be no improvements to existing US 50, Lake Parkway, or other roadways within the project site boundaries. No bicycle, pedestrian, or transit improvements would be made. The current road alignment and lane configuration would remain the same.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Alternative B would construct a realignment of US 50 to the southeast of existing US 50 from just west of the Pioneer Trail intersection in California to Lake Parkway in Nevada. Realigned US 50 would begin at a relocated Pioneer Trail intersection located to the west of the existing intersection, and proceed south along existing Moss Road. It would then turn east onto the Montreal Road alignment, passing behind (southeast of) the Heavenly Village Center shopping complex, and continuing along the existing Montreal Road and Lake Parkway alignments before ending at a new two-lane roundabout at the existing US 50/Lake Parkway intersection. This EIR/EIS/EIS also contemplates an option that would retain a signalized intersection at US 50/Lake Parkway, instead of a roundabout. TTD has designated Alternative B as the “locally preferred action,” because TTD believes it best meets the objectives of the project and it emerged as the most supported alternative following public scoping. ROAD NETWORK CHANGES Realigned US 50 would have four 11-foot wide travel lanes, 5-foot wide shoulders, and turn pockets at major intersections and driveways. New signalized intersections along realigned US 50 would be located at Heavenly Village Way and the driveway entrance to Harrah’s. The existing right-of-way of the segment of US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Lake Parkway—the new Main Street—would be relinquished to the City of South Lake Tahoe in California, and Douglas County in Nevada. Realigned US 50 would become Caltrans and Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) right-of-way. Proposed Pedestrian Bridge to Van Sickle Bi-State Park C:\Users\nanette.hansel\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCacheContent.Word\150921 Illustrations_Page_11.jpgBetween Park Avenue and Lake Parkway, the new Main Street would be reduced to one travel lane in each direction, with landscaped medians, and left-turn pockets at major intersections and driveways. Bicycle lanes and sidewalks would be added and/or upgraded throughout the project site. A pedestrian bridge would be constructed over realigned US 50 approximately 250 feet south of the proposed new intersection at the Harrah’s entrance driveway near the California/Nevada state line; the pedestrian bridge would connect Van Sickle Bi-State Park to the tourist core.  RIGHT-OF-WAY ACQUISITION NEEDS The Alternative B realignment of US 50 would require the acquisition of right-of-way. The right-of-way needs would include both partial and full acquisition of parcels within the project site; a total of 99 parcels would be affected by Alternative B. Table 2-1 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives,” of this EIR/EIS/EIS summarizes the total number of affected parcels, by state. Table 2-2 provides a summary description of the types of uses and number of units affected for those parcels listed as full acquisitions in Table 2-1. A full list of specific parcels affected by Alternative B (and other realignment alternatives) is included in Appendix B. Appendix B also includes exhibits that distinguish full and partial parcel acquisitions the realignment alternatives. MIXED-USE REDEVELOPMENT SITES Alternative B includes the redevelopment of three sites within the project site to include a mix of residential and commercial uses. The purpose of the redevelopment sites would be to provide relocation opportunities for dislocated residents and business owners in the immediate vicinity.  Realigned US 50 Near Pedestrian Bridge C:\Users\nanette.hansel\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCacheContent.Word\150921 Illustrations_Page_14.jpgAlternative C: Triangle One-Way The alignment of Alternative C would be the same as Alternative B for the route along existing Montreal Road and Lake Parkway. However, Alternative C would involve one-way travel within the tourist core and on the realigned highway to the southeast. It would reduce right-of-way needs relative to Alternative B, as described below. ROAD NETWORK CHANGES Alternative C would split eastbound and westbound directions on US 50 from the Park Avenue/Heavenly Village/US 50 intersection in California to Lake Parkway/US 50 intersection in Nevada. Eastbound US 50 would remain on the same alignment as the existing highway, while westbound US 50 would be realigned along Lake Parkway southeast of existing US 50. Both eastbound and westbound US 50 would have turn pockets at major intersections and driveways, and would add and/or upgrade bicycle lanes and sidewalks.  Travel lanes along the eastbound and westbound segments would be 11-feet wide. New signalized intersections would be located on westbound US 50 at Heavenly Village Way and the entrance Harrah’s driveway off existing Lake Parkway. Caltrans and NDOT would be required to accept the right-of-way along both segments of US 50 for those portions in their respective state, and the City of South Lake Tahoe and Douglas County would need to relinquish the right-of-way along Lake Parkway, Montreal Road, and other local roadways affected by Alternative C. A pedestrian bridge, similar to Alternative B, would be constructed over westbound US 50 near the California/Nevada state line connecting the Van Sickle Bi-State Park to the Stateline area. RIGHT-OF-WAY ACQUISITION NEEDS The Alternative C realignment of US 50 would require the acquisition of right-of-way similar to Alternative B. The right-of-way needs would include both partial and full acquisition of parcels within the project site; a total of 97 parcels would be affected by Alternative C.  MIXED-USE REDEVELOPMENT SITES Alternative C includes the redevelopment of the same three sites within the project site as Alternative B for the purpose of providing relocation opportunities to the dislocated residents and business owners. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Alternative D is similar to Alternative B in that it would realign US 50 to the southeast of existing US 50 from the Pioneer Trail intersection in California to Lake Parkway in Nevada. The relocated US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection would be further north than the Alternative B alignment. ROAD NETWORK CHANGES The realignment of US 50 associated with Alternative D would begin at a reconstructed Pioneer Trail intersection, and proceed east on a realigned highway segment between existing Echo Road and Fern Road. It would then turn north onto the Montreal Road alignment, passing behind the Heavenly Village Center shopping complex, and continuing along the existing Montreal Road and Lake Parkway alignments before ending at a new two-lane roundabout at the existing US 50/Lake Parkway intersection. This EIR/EIS/EIS also contemplates an option that would retain a signalized intersection at US 50/Lake Parkway, instead of a roundabout. Realigned US 50 would have four 11-foot wide travel lanes, 5-foot wide shoulders, and turn pockets at major intersections and driveways. New signalized intersections would be located at US 50/Heavenly Village Way and the driveway entrance to Harrah’s from US 50. The existing segment of US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Lake Parkway would be relinquished to the City of South Lake Tahoe in California and to Douglas County in Nevada. Realigned US 50 would become Caltrans and NDOT right-of-way.  Between Park Avenue and Lake Parkway, the existing US 50 would be reduced to one lane in each direction, with landscaped medians and left-turn pockets at major intersections and driveways, similar to Alternative B. Bicycle lanes and sidewalks would be added and/or upgraded throughout the project site. A pedestrian bridge would be constructed over realigned US 50 near the California/Nevada State Line connecting the Van Sickle Bi-State Park to the Stateline area.  RIGHT-OF-WAY ACQUISITION NEEDS The Alternative D realignment of US 50 would require the acquisition of right-of-way. The right-of-way needs would include both partial and full acquisition of parcels within the project site; a total of 78 parcels would be affected by Alternative D. MIXED-USE REDEVELOPMENT SITES Like Alternative B, Alternative D includes the redevelopment of three sites within the project site to include a mix of residential and commercial uses that could be relocation opportunities for dislocated residents and business owners.  Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E would feature a concrete deck over the entire width and length of existing US 50 within the tourist core between a location about 100 feet south of Stateline Avenue and a location near the northern end of the Montbleu Resort (about 450 feet south of Lake Parkway). The deck would serve as a pedestrian “skywalk” facility or pedestrian walkway between the resort-casinos. The width would be approximately 75 feet. The skywalk would be constructed on 4-feet wide columns spaced approximately 20 feet on center running along both sides of the highway for the entire length of the bridge. The purpose of the skywalk would be to enhance pedestrian facilities and separate pedestrians from the highway through the tourist core near the resort-casinos to allow for improved traffic flow. Alternative E would avoid the need to acquire property and displace uses and people in the existing community.  ROAD NETWORK CHANGES Alternative E: Skywalk The configuration of US 50 would remain as it is today, except that the signal and at-grade pedestrian scramble between Hard Rock and Montbleu would be removed. The improvements on Stateline Avenue would be the same as that which would occur for Alternative B.  RIGHT-OF-WAY ACQUISITION NEEDS Alternative E would be constructed entirely within the existing US 50 right-of-way and would not require any property acquisitions. Alternative E would not displace any residents or businesses.  MIXED-USE REDEVELOPMENT SITES Alternative E does not include the potential future redevelopment sites associated with Alternatives B through D. Because Alternative E would not displace any residents or businesses, it would not be necessary to provide replacement housing or commercial space as part of this alternative. S.4 ISSUES SUBJECT TO PUBLIC CONTROVERSY The State CEQA Guidelines require an EIR to include a list of areas of potential controversy and issues to be resolved.  Based on public input received during the scoping process and the outreach that followed, areas of controversy could include the purpose and need for the project, displacement of existing residents and businesses in the City of South Lake Tahoe, impacts on Van Sickle Bi-State Park, noise impacts in residential neighborhoods, effects on water quality, effects on air quality, and impacts on public safety. Additional project details requested by commenters and an assessment of suggested alternatives to the project are included in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives.” Appendix A includes a complete list of comments received during the scoping period. The following are key issues related to the project:  Acquiring Project Funding   TTD has funding to complete the environmental review process and full design (preliminary through final) of the approved alternative. TTD also has some Right-of-Way funds for property acquisition and relocation, which have been secured through State Transportation Block Grant (CA and NV) and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) grants. Funding for the remaining property acquisition, relocation, and project construction would come from a variety of federal, state, and local sources, including Federal Transportation Act funds incorporated into recently passed legislation, Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund from revenues of the Cap-and-Trade program administered by the California Air Resources Board, and newly adopted taxes from Douglas County, among others.   Community Impacts  Impacts on Rocky Point Residents and Adjacent Businesses: The project’s impact on the Rocky Point neighborhood and adjacent businesses has been one of the primary concerns of the public and decision-makers. The realignment alternatives would displace between 68 and 72 residential units and four to seven businesses to accommodate the realignment, depending on the specific alternative. The neighborhood affected by the project has a higher proportion of population that is below the poverty level and are minorities, compared to the general populations of the city, county, and Stateline Census-Designated Place (CDP). As a result, an environmental justice concern arises, because low-income and minority populations would disproportionately experience adverse environmental and displacement effects of the project. TTD has committed to constructing replacement housing and relocation assistance to affected persons prior to initiating construction of the transportation improvements and initiating the right-of-way acquisition process in California. In spite of the project’s benefits, other measures included in the project to minimize adverse effects, and additional planning efforts to identify alternatives that would eliminate or reduce impacts, the preliminary determination from FHWA is that the project would still have a disproportionately high and adverse effect on minority and low-income populations in the Rocky Point neighborhood.  Division of the Existing Rocky Point Neighborhood: With implementation of the realignment alternatives, US 50 would be rerouted through an established neighborhood, which is characterized as having moderate community cohesion due to the presence of a concentrated minority population and transit-dependent population. The highway realignment and physical division of the neighborhood would change the character and cohesiveness of the neighborhood by displacing residents and substantially changing the visual character and ambient noise environment. The realigned US 50 would create a physical barrier restricting pedestrian access across the new highway alignment, although vehicular connectivity through the neighborhood would be maintained. Increased trip lengths for pedestrians and bicyclists in this neighborhood would need to maneuver around the realigned highway. The division would be offset to a degree by the enhanced bicycle and pedestrian features (e.g., sidewalks and bicycle lanes) along the realigned highway and through the tourist core. These three alternatives (Alternatives B, C, and D) would physically divide residents within the Rocky Point neighborhood from each other, and for those residents southwest of the realigned highway, from the adjacent commercial and tourist core area. Minimizing the community division impact is a key issue for consideration during preparation of the final design plans.  Impacts on Parks and Trails  Enhancing Access to Van Sickle Bi-State Park and Maintaining the Visual Connection to Tourist Core: Providing enhanced access to Van Sickle Bi-State Park is one of TTD’s basic project objectives. The realignment alternatives (Alternatives B through D) would encroach into the park, requiring acquisition of about 0.5 acres of park land. TTD has consulted with the California Tahoe Conservancy and the Nevada Division of State Lands, the managers of the park, on measures to compensate for this encroachment. Each of the realignment alternatives would provide a new, grade-separated pedestrian and bicycle bridge over the realigned US 50 from the tourist core to Van Sickle Bi-state Park near the state line. This would become a new gateway to the park for visitors from the tourist core. These alternatives also include improved signage, context-sensitive design treatments for highway retaining walls and the proposed pedestrian bridge, paths and trails for bicycles and pedestrians, and two signalized at-grade crosswalks at existing park access points (the crossing near the entrance to Harrah’s has no traffic control, and the existing Heavenly Village Way/Lake Parkway intersection is stop sign controlled). These improvements would better connect Van Sickle Bi-State Park to the tourist core and would make access safer and easier for pedestrians and bicyclists, and would enhance long-term access to the park.  Extending the Linear Park Shared-Use Path through the Tourist Core: The realignment alternatives would involve intersection and roadway construction along US 50 immediately adjacent to the Linear Park Multi-Use Trail on the west side of the project site. Construction of the new US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection and transportation improvements would require acquisition of between 0.08 and 0.09 acre, depending on the alternative, of the landscaped area, would reduce the width of the Linear Park in certain locations, and would realign a section of the Linear Park Multi-Use Trail. These alternatives would also include installation of a split rail barrier fence to separate the Linear Park from US 50 in certain locations where the path would be closest to the highway and would not meet minimum separation distances. The proposed transportation improvements and barrier fence would not decrease long-term access to the Linear Park and would retain the width of the existing 8-foot path. The realignment alternatives also provide the opportunities for the Linear Park Multi-Use Trail to be extended through the tourist core to the future segment of the Nevada Stateline-to-Stateline Bikeway alignment beginning at the corner of Lake Parkway and US 50. The fence adjacent to the Tahoe Meadows Historic District would be retained in its current location.  Impacts on Utilities  Avoiding Utility Conflicts: The transportation improvements related to the build alternatives and development of the mixed-use sites could result in conflicts with existing utility infrastructure and require relocation of utilities or access points to utility infrastructure (i.e., water, sewer, electrical, and natural gas services). TTD has coordinated with utility providers (i.e., South Tahoe Public Utility District, Douglas County Sewer Improvement District, Edgewood Water Company, Lakeside Park Association, Liberty Utilities, NV Energy, and Southwest Gas Corporation) throughout the preliminary design phase and in preparation of this EIR/EIS/EIS and would continue to do so through the final design plans and construction. Any relocation of affected utility infrastructure would be coordinated with utility providers.  Providing Adequate Snow Removal and Storage: TTD would be required to provide for adequate snow removal and storage, as required by Douglas County, the City of South Lake Tahoe, TRPA, Caltrans, and NDOT. Melt water from snow storage areas carries concentrated amounts of nutrients, fine sediments, salt, sand pollutants from vehicles such as petroleum hydrocarbons, oil, or heavy metals and materials from road and tire wear. Some of the parcels acquired through the right-of-way acquisition would be used for the purposes of snow storage. All potential snow storage locations would be designed to drain to best management practice (BMP) water quality treatment facilities capable of handling large sediment loads. In accordance with TRPA Code Section 60.1.4, all snow storage areas would meet the site criteria and management standards in the TRPA Handbook of Best Management Practices. In addition, snow storage areas may not be located within SEZs. The location of snow storage areas would be shown on all final design plans and a snow removal plan would be included with the improvement plan submittal.   Multi-Modal Improvements  Enhanced Transit, and Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities: The realignment alternatives would include a variety of bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure improvements that would enhance connectivity in the study area. These improvements would include improved and expanded sidewalks (new sidewalks would be constructed along the realigned US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Heavenly Village Way, as well as on the mountain side of US 50 between Lake Parkway and SR 207), enhanced bicycle facilities (either new bicycle lanes or a Class IV, or Cycle Track, through the tourist core connecting the Linear Park Multi-Use Trail to the Nevada Stateline-to-Stateline Bikeway). The enhancements would also include improved transit service, as well as the construction of new bus shelters through the tourist core. One of TTD’s basic project objectives includes improving connectivity, reliability, travel times, and operations of public transportation modes, including increased mobility and safety for bicycles and pedestrians and enhanced public access to Van Sickle Bi-State Park via the new pedestrian bridge.  Visual Resource Effects  Visual Effect of a Sound Barrier: Realignment of US 50 would redirect the majority of traffic through residential areas, exposing sensitive receptors to substantial increases in noise levels. A sound barrier (e.g., wood, brick adobe, and earthen berm, boulders, or combination thereof) is the most effective option to reduce noise exposure in these areas. However, although all feasible design treatments (e.g., landscaped berm to reduce visible mass and landscape screening) would be included to minimize visual effects on the Rocky Point neighborhood, the introduction of the highway and sound barrier into the neighborhood’s visual setting could be problematic. A sound barrier or other noise treatment would ensure the TRPA’s noise thresholds are not violated. TTD would need to carefully consider context-sensitive design solutions in the final design plans to minimize these effects.   Water Quality Enhancements Illustration of Sound Barrier along Realigned US 50 Implement Water Quality Enhancements Beyond the Lake Tahoe Environmental Improvement Program: Through coordination with stakeholders and a review of the strengths and weaknesses of the existing stormwater management systems within the study area, the project design team identified several measures that would enhance the ability of existing systems to protect water quality, and would create water quality benefits through the capture of currently untreated stormwater runoff. The enhancements to the stormwater system would be designed to more than offset increases in impervious surfaces resulting from the realignment alternatives, so they would implement water quality improvements above and beyond those contemplated in the Lake Tahoe Environmental Improvement Program. S.5 SUMMARY OF IMPACTS AND MITIGATION As discussed above, the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project is a joint project proposed by TTD, TRPA, and FHWA, and is subject to state and federal environmental review requirements. Project documentation, therefore, has been prepared in compliance with CEQA; TRPA’s Tahoe Regional Planning Compact, Code of Ordinances, and Rules of Procedure; and NEPA. TTD and TRPA have determined that an EIR and an EIS, respectively, would provide the appropriate level of environmental analysis. Impacts described in this document were found to be potentially adverse under NEPA, requiring preparation of an EIS. After receiving comments from the public and reviewing agencies, a final environmental document will be prepared. The lead agencies may prepare additional environmental and/or engineering studies to address comments. The final environmental document will include responses to comments received on the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS. If the decision is made to approve an action alternative to implement the project, a Notice of Determination will be published for compliance with CEQA and FHWA will issue a Record of Decision (ROD) for compliance with NEPA. Chapter 3, “Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences, and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures,” of this Draft EIR/EIS/EIS describes in detail the environmental effects that would result from implementation of the project alternatives. Impacts are determined to be: 1) no impact; 2) not adverse, for the purposes of NEPA, or less than significant, for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA; 3) adverse, for the purposes of NEPA, or significant or potentially significant, for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA (potentially adverse changes in the environment, for which mitigation measures are required); and 4) adverse, for the purposes of NEPA, or significant and unavoidable, for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA (adverse changes in the environment that cannot be feasibly reduced to less-than-significant levels with mitigation measures). Where appropriate, for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, beneficial impacts associated with the project alternatives are also noted. Table S-1 (at the end of this chapter) summarizes the potential environmental effects that would result from implementation of the build alternatives; describes avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures to address adverse and significant and potentially significant environmental effects; and identifies the significance of impacts both before and after mitigation.  Table S-1 Summary of Resource Topics with Impacts and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures  Resource Topics/Impacts  Environmental Consequences (NEPA)/ Impact Determinations (CEQA, TRPA) before Mitigation (by Alternative)  Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures  Environmental Consequences (NEPA)/ Impact Determinations (CEQA, TRPA)  after Mitigation (by Alternative)  NEPA   CEQA/TRPA  NEPA   CEQA/TRPA  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  3.2 Land Use            Impact 3.2-1: Conflict with or impede implementation of existing land use plans and policies Implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would have the potential to conflict with certain policies in relevant planning documents (see Appendix E and summarized herein). However, a conflict with a specific policy alone does not constitute “inconsistency” with a land use plan. The environmental effects of any policy conflicts are addressed in the individual resource sections in Chapter 3, “Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences, and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures,” of this document. Mitigation is incorporated to avoid or minimize significant effects to the extent feasible. Because Alternatives B, C, and D would implement the broader vision and goals of the overarching land use plans (i.e., RTP/SCS, TCAP, SSAP, and ATP), these alternatives would not be in conflict with existing land use plans.  Because Alternative A would not construct a realigned US 50 around the tourist core along with other pedestrian and bicycle improvements, Alternative A would not meet the planning goals of the RTP/SCS, TCAP, and SSAP; however, Alternative A would not preclude construction of future transportation improvements in the study area. Similarly, Alternative E would only meet some of the goals of these plans related to safe pedestrian movement along US 50 in the resort-casino portion of the tourist core, because of the limited extent and nature of the improvements. Neither Alternative A nor Alternative E would preclude the possibility for a future proposal to implement similar transportation improvements as those identified in Alternatives B, C, and D. For these reasons, while Alternatives A  The design features of Alternatives A, B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alts A, B, C, D, E = LTS  No avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement for the purposes of NEPA or to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  NA  Alts A, B, C, D, E = LTS  Table S-1

3.2-2: Include uses that are not listed as permissible uses in the applicable PASs, community plans, and area plans or expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use Alternative A would be a

The transportation improvements proposed for Alternatives B, C, and D, including the realigned US 50, pedestrian overcrossing, and pedestrian and bicycle improvements, meet TRPA’s definition of a transportation route. The raised pedestrian walkway proposed with Alternative E also meets this definition. These project features are identified as either allowable or special uses in applicable planning documents.

No Impact for Alternative A Alt A = NI  The project proponent shall ensure that the Transportation Management Plan (TMP) prepared for the project addresses all modes of transportation used to access recreation areas, including vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle modes. To mitigate short-term decreases in access to recreation resources, the TMP shall include detour plans that meet, at a minimum, the following specifications: 1. During construction of the relocated US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection, the pedestrian and bike trail within Linear Park may be required to be temporarily closed in the construction area. If this closure is required, all bicycle and pedestrian traffic shall be detoured to a temporary trail/path on the highway, separated from vehicle traffic by a physical barrier such as “K-Rail.” Signage will be provided at the western end of Linear Park, at the intersection of Wildwood Avenue and US 50, and approaching the construction zone to alert trail users about the timing, duration, and nature of any construction-related closures and detours.  2. During construction of the new US 50/Heavenly Village Way intersection, roadway improvements eastward along the realigned US 50 alignment, and the pedestrian bridge over the new US 50 ROW, vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle access to Van Sickle Bi-State Park shall be maintained through the use of detours and traffic control for all modes. Signage will be provided along roadways and sidewalks approaching the construction zone and in parking areas and trailheads within Van Sickle Bi-State Park to alert pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists about the timing, duration, and nature of construction-related closures and detours.  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  3. During the restriping of Lake Parkway, vehicular access to Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course shall be maintained by the use of detours and traffic control. Measures will be taken to keep the public informed of the project construction activities. When closures and/or detours are required, warning signs and signs regarding restricted access and detours will be posted to ensure adequate public safety. Detour routes will be clearly marked, and construction fencing or physical barriers will be installed to prevent access to the construction site and to clearly delineate the detour route. Full closure of trails or recreation facilities by the contractor(s) will be prohibited from July 1 through Labor Day weekend unless an approved detour has been established. All bicycle and pedestrian detours will be identified in the TMP and will be reviewed and approved by the project proponent, Caltrans, and TRPA before the start of earth-moving activities.  Impact 3.3-2: Long-term change in public access to public lands and recreation areas Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements and mixed-use development including replacement housing would include improvements that facilitate enhanced access from the tourist core by creating an improved setting for walking and bicycling throughout the core area. Alternatives B, C, and D would increase public access to Van Sickle Bi-State Park and/or Linear Park as a result of the pedestrian/bicycle bridge over realigned US 50 that would increase connectivity for visitors to the tourist core. Alternatives B, C, D, and E would not result in a long-term decrease in public access to Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course, because of the option to restripe Lake  The design features of Alternatives B, C, and D would avoid or minimize long-term changes in public access to public lands and recreation areas such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alts A, E = NI  Alts A, E = NI Alts B, C,  D = B  No avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement for the purposes of NEPA or to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  NA  Alts A, E = NI Alts B, C,  D = B  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  Parkway west of existing US 50, which would occur within the existing road footprint.  Impact 3.3-3: Increased demand for or physical deterioration of recreation facilities To offset displacement of low- and moderate-income housing units acquired to accommodate project construction, Alternatives B, C, and D propose to construct replacement housing as part of mixed-use development at three locations within the South Lake Tahoe portion of the project site. If the number of housing units that are constructed is equivalent to those displaced, there would be no net increase in demand for recreation facilities, physical deterioration of the study area recreation facilities would not increase, and additional recreation resources would not be required.  However, the mixed-use development at Sites 1, 2, and 3 as conceptualized in Alternatives B, C, and D could include construction of additional housing units above and beyond those necessary to replace units displaced by the project. Alternative B could result in a net increase of 139 housing units, Alternative C an additional 144 housing units, and Alternative D an additional 132 housing units. Because the type of higher density development and recreation demand associated with the mixed-use development including replacement housing has already been contemplated in the TCAP environmental review and Regional Plan, Alternatives B, C, and D would not substantively increase demand for recreation facilities, increase physical deterioration, or require additional recreation resources. Alternatives A and E would not include mixed-use development and the Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would not result in an increase in demand for recreation facilities, physical deterioration of the study area recreation  The design features of Alternatives B, C, and D would avoid or minimize the recreation demand environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alts A, E = NI  Alts B, C, D = LTS  Alts A, E = NI  No avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement for the purposes of NEPA or to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  NA  Alts B, C, D = LTS  Alts A, E = NI  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  facilities would not increase, and additional recreation resources would not be required.  Impact 3.3-4: Changes to the quality of recreation user experience Because Alternatives A and E would not include any infrastructure improvements in the vicinity of Lake Tahoe, public lands and/or recreation areas, Alternatives A and E would not affect the recreation user experience in the study area.  The effects of Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements on the quality of recreation user experience at the Linear Park and Edgewood Companies mountain parcel would not be substantial because recreation user experience at these facilities is currently influenced by similar vehicle traffic on adjacent US 50 and Lake Parkway and the user experience would be similar to existing conditions. The mixed-use development including replacement housing proposed for Alternatives B, C, and D would be located adjacent to or near the Linear Park; however, these alternatives would not result in a substantial change in the quality of recreation user experience at this recreation facility, because the Linear Park is currently adjacent to existing US 50 and the user experience would be similar to existing conditions. Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would increase traffic and traffic noise levels in some areas of Van Sickle Bi-State Park; however, noise level changes at these locations would not be discernible by users at the park facilities (also discussed in Impact 3.15-3). These alternatives would use design solutions that reflect the local character, is appropriate for the site, and is compatible with the surrounding environment in the changes at the main entrance to the park,  The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and Alternative E would avoid or minimize the change in the quality of recreation user experience environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alt A = NI   Alts A, E = NI Alts B, C, D = LTS  No avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement for the purposes of NEPA or to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  NA  Alts A, E = NI Alts B, C, D = LTS  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  the pedestrian overcrossing into the park, and the retaining wall along the mountain side of existing Lake Parkway. For these reasons, and taking into account the park setting in proximity to an urban area, Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would not substantially diminish recreation user experience.  Recognizing the influence of the combination of both detractions and enhancements to recreation resource site conditions (i.e., adverse for forest use, beneficial for access and amenities) and reasonably anticipating that user expectations take into account the setting, nearby urban area, and existing use patterns, the effect of the project’s infrastructure improvements would have little effect on the quality of recreation user experiences in the study area.  3.4 Community Impacts            Impact 3.4-1: Physically divide an established community causing changes to community character and cohesion With implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements, US 50 would be rerouted through an established neighborhood (generally known as Rocky Point), which is characterized as having moderate community cohesion due to the presence of a concentrated minority population and transit-dependent population. The highway realignment and physical division of the neighborhood would change the character and cohesiveness of the neighborhood by displacing residents and substantially changing the visual character and ambient noise environment (see Sections 3.7, “Visual Resources/Aesthetics” and 3.15, “Noise and Vibration”). The realigned US 50 would create a physical barrier restricting pedestrian access across the new highway alignment, although vehicular connectivity through the  Alts A, E = NI Mitigation Measure 3.4-1 has been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to physical division of an established community and associated adverse changes in the character and cohesiveness of a residential neighborhood.  Alts A, E = NI Alts B, C, D = S  Mitigation Measure 3.4-1: Minimize effects on the character and cohesiveness of the Rocky Point Neighborhood The following mitigation measure applies to Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. With respect to changes in visual conditions and noise that affect the character and cohesiveness of the Rocky Point neighborhood, implement Mitigation Measure 3.7-1a (see Section 3.7, “Visual Resources/Aesthetics”) and Mitigation Measures 3.15-3a, 3.15-3b, and 3.15-3c (see Section 3.15, “Noise and Vibration”).  Alts A, E = NI Additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to physical division of an established community and associated adverse changes in the character and cohesiveness of a residential neighborhood.  Alts A, E = NI Alts B, C, D = SU  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  neighborhood would be maintained. Increased trip lengths for pedestrians and bicyclists in this neighborhood would in part be offset by the enhanced bicycle and pedestrian features (e.g., sidewalk and bicycle lane) along the new highway. These three alternatives would physically divide residences within the Rocky Point neighborhood from each other, and for those residents southwest of the realigned highway from the adjacent commercial and tourist core area. Residents and businesses would be displaced by right-of-way acquisition. (Note: displacement is discussed further in Impact 3.4-4.) Considering these impact influences together, the physical division of an established community caused by the Alternatives B, C, and D realignment of US 50 would result in adverse changes in the character and cohesiveness of a residential neighborhood.  The mixed-use development sites associated with Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, are the preferred locations for construction of replacement housing for residents displaced by the project. Implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would include new buildings that are consistent in character to other existing, newer development, would replace hotel units with housing units and commercial uses that would contribute to a stronger sense of community, and would not physically divide an established neighborhood. For these reasons, these alternatives with mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not result in any adverse changes in the character and cohesiveness of a residential neighborhood beyond those associated with the Alternatives B, C, and D. Because Alternative A would include no changes and Alternative E would not include project components located  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  within an established neighborhood community, these alternatives would not adversely affect community character or cohesion or disrupt or divide an established community.  Impact 3.4-2: Alter the location, distribution, or growth of the human population for the Region during construction Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would generate a temporary increase in employment in the South Shore of Lake Tahoe of approximately 80 construction jobs during construction of the transportation improvements. The maximum number of construction employees on-site at one time would be approximately 30 employees during the most intensive construction phase of the transportation improvements. For construction of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for Alternatives B, C, and D, these alternatives would generate approximately 90 construction jobs during the most intensive construction phase and would generate approximately 175 construction employees if two of the mixed-use development sites are constructed simultaneously. Construction of Alternative E would generate a temporary increase in employment of approximately 45 construction jobs with the maximum number of employees on-site at one time would be approximately 15 construction employees. The number of existing construction personnel in the study area and surrounding areas would be sufficient to meet demand associated with the build alternatives; therefore, this temporary increase in employment is not expected to generate substantial temporary population growth or generate the need for additional housing for construction workers. Therefore, Alternatives B, C, D, and E would not alter the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region.  Alternative A would not result in any new construction and, thus, would not increase demand for construction workers or  Alt A = NI The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize effects related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the population during construction.  Alt A = NI Alts B, C, D, E = LTS  No avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement for the purposes of NEPA or to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  NA  Alt A = NI Alts B, C, D, E = LTS  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  result in an associated increase in housing demand during construction. Alternative A would not induce substantial population growth or housing demand in the Region during construction.  Impact 3.4-3: Alter the location, distribution, or growth of the human population for the Region during operation Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements and Alternative E could result in additional road and facility maintenance needs during operation but would not generate demand for a substantial number of new employees. The transportation improvements do not include components that would increase population and, thus, would not generate additional demand for housing. Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements and Alternative E would not alter the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region. Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in the same needs for additional road and facility maintenance needs described for these alternatives transportation improvements. With development of new commercial and housing units associated with the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, Alternatives B, C, and D would generate a net increase of up to approximately 180 – 210 new jobs and an estimated net population increase of approximately 320 – 340 people (after accounting for replacement of housing and employment displaced by the project). The additional demand for employees would likely be met by existing residents in the South Shore area. Furthermore, the employment and population growth generated by the mixed-use development, including commercial and residential uses, has been planned for as part of the Regional Plan and the Tourist Core Area Plan.  Alt A = NI The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize effects related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the population during operation.  Alt A = NI Alts B, C, D, E = LTS  No avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement for the purposes of NEPA or to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  NA  Alt A = NI Alts B, C, D, E = LTS  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  Thus, Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not alter the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region. Alternative A would not result in any changes to existing conditions that would increase housing demand. Alternative A would not alter the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region.  Impact 3.4-4: Housing supply availability, including affordable housing Acquisition of land and buildings necessary for the US 50 realignment, new US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection, new sidewalks and bike lanes, and the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would displace existing residences with the Alternative B, C, and D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing. TTD would provide relocation assistance to all eligible displaced owner and tenant residents in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Act and the Relocation Assistance Law. These alternatives would also include construction of replacement housing, including deed-restricted affordable and deed-restricted moderate-income housing, equal to or greater than the number of housing units displaced prior to relocating owner and tenant residents and prior to construction of transportation improvements in California. For these reasons, the Alternative B, C, and D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in no net loss of housing, including affordable and moderate-income housing, in the South Shore and there would be no need to construct additional affordable housing elsewhere beyond those included in the project.   Alts A, E = NI Compliance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law and the design features of Alternatives B, C, and D would avoid or minimize effects on housing supply availability, including affordable housing, such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alts A, E = NI Alts B, C, D = LTS  No avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement for the purposes of NEPA or to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  NA  Alts A, E = NI Alts B, C, D = LTS  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  Alternative A would include no changes and Alternative E would not require acquisition of private property and, thus, would not displace housing (including affordable housing) or residents.  Impact 3.4-5: Displacement of businesses Alternatives B, C, and D, transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would require full acquisition of parcels containing businesses. Alternatives B and C transportation improvements would affect four businesses (14 employees), and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would affect 10 additional businesses (78 additional employees). Alternative D transportation improvements would affect seven businesses (57 employees), and the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would affect three additional businesses (21 additional employees). TTD would provide relocation assistance to all eligible displaced businesses in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Act and the Relocation Assistance Law. The Relocation Study (TTD 2012) indicated that there would be a sufficient supply of existing business relocation properties in the South Shore area. Therefore, implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D, transportation improvements or mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not require construction of new buildings for relocation of displaced businesses. Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, could include construction of new commercial space, which could provide additional locations for the displaced businesses to relocate.  Alternative A would include no changes and Alternative E would not require acquisition of private property and, thus, would not displace businesses.  Alts A, E = NI Compliance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law and the design features of Alternatives B, C, and D would avoid or minimize effects related to displacement of businesses such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alts A, E = NI Alts B, C, D = LTS  No avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement for the purposes of NEPA or to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  NA  Alts A, E = NI Alts B, C, D = LTS  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  3.5 Public Services and Utilities            Impact 3.5-1: Conflicts with existing utility infrastructure Transportation improvements and construction of mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for Alternatives B, C, and D could result in conflicts with existing utility infrastructure and require relocation of utilities or access points to utility infrastructure (i.e., water, sewer, electrical, and natural gas services). Depending on the alternative, utility infrastructure that could be affected by the build alternatives is generally located at and around the existing US 50/Pioneer Trail and Pioneer Trail/Echo Road intersections and along existing US 50, Fern Road, Moss Road, Montreal Road, and the lake side of Lake Parkway. TTD would be required to coordinate with utility providers to address the project’s conflicts with utility infrastructure. However, the extent to which existing utility infrastructure could be adversely affected, and plans for relocation, have not yet been determined, and plans for any necessary relocation have not yet been determined.  Alt A = NI Mitigation Measure 3.5-1 has been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, D, and E to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to conflicts with existing utility infrastructure.  Alt A = NI Alts B, C, D, E = PS  Mitigation Measure 3.5-1: Prepare and implement a Utility Relocation Study This mitigation measure is required for Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, and Alternative E, for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Before the start of construction-related activities, including demolition of displaced residential, hotel/motel, and commercial buildings, the TTD (and the project proponent for the mixed-use development) shall coordinate with STPUD, DCSID, EWC, Lakeside Park Association, Liberty Utilities, NV Energy, and Southwest Gas Corporation to relocate utility infrastructure, which is dependent on the alternative and could include infrastructure at and near the existing US 50/Pioneer Trail and Pioneer Trail/Echo Road intersections and along US 50, Fern Road, Moss Road, Primrose Road, Montreal Road, and the lake side of Lake Parkway. The final design plans for the transportation improvements submitted to Caltrans and NDOT shall identify all utility relocations affected by the transportation improvements. To minimize disruption to utility services, relocation of the utility lines shall occur after any required clearing and demolition within the study area and before construction of the realigned US 50 and other transportation improvements. Actions needed to comply with this mitigation measure include coordination with each affected utility company to prepare a utility relocation study that would, at a minimum, include the following:  plans that identify the utility infrastructure elements that require relocation as a result of constructing  Alt A = NI Alts B, C, D, E = No additional mitigation measures would be needed or are feasible to implement.  Alt A = NI Alts B, C, D, E = LTS  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  the project transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing;   safety measures to avoid any human health hazards or environmental hazards associated with capping and abandoning some utility infrastructure, such as natural gas lines or sewer lines;  timing for completion of the utility infrastructure relocation as part of construction of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, which shall be scheduled to minimize disruption to the utility companies and their customers;   reparations, if required, and certification of necessary additional environmental evaluations and pertinent processes (e.g., CEQA, NEPA, and/or TRPA documents and requirements), all of which shall be completed, as necessary, before final plans for the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, are permitted;   preparation and approval by a licensed civil engineer; and   approval as adequate by the affected utility companies and Caltrans, NDOT, TTD, and TRPA, as necessary.  Impact 3.5-2: Increased demand for water supply  Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would generate water demand for dust suppression during construction that would be met by water trucks as necessary. Implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would require water supplies for operation of residential and commercial uses and for fire suppression.

Alternative E would generate water demand for dust suppression during construction, which would be met by water trucks as necessary.  measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Impact 3.5-3: Increased demand for wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment  Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements and Alternative E would not result in an increased demand on wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment because construction workers would use portable toilets rather than public wastewater facilities.  Construction of mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for Alternatives B, C, and D would require additional wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment to serve the additional residential and commercial development. Adequate capacity is available in the wastewater treatment plant to serve the wastewater flows generated by the mixed-use development, including replacement housing. However, the addition of wastewater flows from the mixed-use development would exceed the capacity of one segment of pipe in the wastewater collection and conveyance system near the McDonald’s on Lake Tahoe Boulevard and contribute flows to another segment of pipe on Lakeshore Boulevard south of Park Avenue that is already over capacity. Because no project activity would be implemented with Alternative A, there would be no change in demand for wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment.  Alts A, E = NI Mitigation Measure 3.5-3 has been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to demand for wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment  Alts A, E = NI Alts B, C, D = PS  Mitigation Measure 3.5-3: Ensure sufficient capacity in the STPUD wastewater collection and conveyance system This mitigation measure is required for Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Prior to completion of project-level environmental review for the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, the project applicant shall coordinate with STPUD to determine the wastewater conveyance demand for a detailed project design, including the number of housing units and square footage of commercial floor area. If STPUD finds that the project-generated peak wastewater flows cause the STPUD line between SSMH BJ182 and SSMH BJ181 to surcharge, then STPUD and the project applicant shall develop plans for and construct improvements that would allow for conveyance of buildout wastewater flows. The project applicant shall be responsible for covering the cost of improvements that would be needed to serve the mixed-use development. The improvements shall be constructed to meet peak wet weather flows in the sewer line between SSMH BJ182 and SSMH BJ181, located near McDonald’s and Lake Tahoe Vacation Resort on Lake Tahoe Boulevard. The plans shall identify the timing of the improvements, and that the capacity of the line will be available when needed by the mixed-use development. Replacement of this  Alts A, E = NI Alts B, C, D, E = No additional mitigation measures would be needed or are feasible to implement.  Alts A, E = NI Alts B, C, D = LTS  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  sewer line shall be completed prior to occupancy of the mixed-use development.  If STPUD finds that project-generated peak wastewater flows contribute to an existing surcharge condition at SSMH BJ25, then STPUD and the project applicant shall either develop plans for and construct improvements that would allow for the conveyance of buildout wastewater flows. Alternatively, the project applicant would be required to pay their fair share towards improvements at SSMH BJ25.  The project applicant shall provide a will-serve letter from STPUD that indicates their wastewater treatment collection and conveyance infrastructure has adequate capacity to serve the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, and that any necessary improvements to the system have been completed prior to the issuance of occupancy permits by the City of South Lake Tahoe.  Impact 3.5-4: Increased generation of solid waste  Under the build alternatives, waste generated during land clearing, grubbing, scraping, excavation, land leveling, grading, cut and fill, and demolition activities would require disposal. Under Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, scenarios, solid waste generation would increase over the long term as a result of new housing units and commercial units. However, the Lockwood Regional Landfill presently has a capacity of approximately 280 million cubic yards. Waste generated as part of the project would not represent a substantial proportion of remaining capacity at the landfill. Additionally, Alternatives B, C, D, and E would implement a Construction Waste Management plan and divert a minimum of 65 percent of construction and demolition waste from the landfill.  Alt A = NI The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize solid waste demand environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alt A = NI Alts B, C,  D, E = LTS  No avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement for the purposes of NEPA or to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  NA  Alt A = NI Alts B, C,  D, E = LTS  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  Impact 3.5-5: Inefficient and wasteful consumption of energy The energy used for project construction would not require substantial additional power generation capacity or substantially increase peak or base-period demand for electricity and other forms of energy. New housing units associated with Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would be required to meet Title 24 standards for energy efficiency. The mixed-use development sites would be concentrated within walking distance of retail, restaurants, and services. In addition, vehicle trips generated by the project would not be considered inefficient, wasteful, or unnecessary in comparison to other similar developments in the Region.  Alt A = NI The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to inefficient or wasteful consumption of energy.  Alt A = NI Alts B, C,  D, E = LTS  No avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement for the purposes of NEPA or to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  NA  Alt A = NI Alts B, C,  D, E = LTS  Impact 3.5-6: Increased demand for law enforcement and fire and emergency services Multiple local, state, and federal agencies provide police, fire, and emergency services to the study area throughout high and low tourist seasons. Because Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would not result in an increased population, there would be no increase in demand for police, fire, or emergency services. With Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, population increases would not be substantial enough to require additional police, fire, or emergency services.

For Alternatives B, C, and D, TTD would construct replacement housing and relocate residents before initiating construction of the transportation improvements in California. This analysis focuses on Site 3, because redevelopment of Site 1 before the transportation improvements is not feasible given its location on existing US 50, and Site 2 is located at the edge of the existing Rocky Point neighborhood and would displace businesses that generate similar traffic volumes where the impact on existing intersection operations is expected to be minimal. The Site 3 redevelopment potential would be the same under all three alternatives. Modeled intersections operations would remain at acceptable levels for Alternatives B, C, and D. Alternatives A and E would not displace residents and would not include any residential displacement or redevelopment. Intersection operations under Alternatives A and E would remain unchanged.  Alts A, E = NI The design features of Alternatives B, C, and D would avoid or minimize the impacts on intersection operations such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alts A, B, C, D, E = NI  No avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement for the purposes of NEPA or to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  NA  Alts A, B, C, D, E = NI  Impact 3.6-2 Impacts of transportation improvements on intersection operations – 2020 (Opening Day) The US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project would not generate additional 2020 (opening day) vehicle trips  The design features of Alternatives A, B, D, and E would avoid or minimize the impacts on intersection  Alt A = LTS Alts B, D, E = B  Alt C = S  Mitigation Measure 3.6-2: Change the eastbound and westbound directional traffic on US 50 This mitigation would apply to Alternative C transportation improvements for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Alts A, B, D, E = NA Alt C = No additional mitigation measures  Alt A = LTS Alts B, D, E = B  Alt C = LTS  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  that could affect intersection operations; rather, it would implement improvements to existing transportation infrastructure and change circulation patterns within the study area. For Alternatives B, C, and D, US 50 would be realigned to connect to and approximately follow the existing Lake Parkway East alignment. Under Alternatives A and E, the existing US 50 roadway alignment would remain the same as existing conditions. Under Alternative E, LOS intersection operations would remain at acceptable levels in 2020 and LOS at the intersection of Old US 50/Stateline Avenue would improve substantially. Under Alternatives B and D, LOS would improve at several intersections compared to existing conditions. All intersections would operate at acceptable LOS under Alternative A. The implementation of Alternative C would result in unacceptable intersection LOS at the new US 50/Pioneer Trail/Old US 50, Old US 50/Park Avenue/Heavenly Village Way, and new US 50/Lake Parkway/Old US 50 (roundabout option) intersections during summer peak-hour conditions. Exhibits 3.6-10 through 3.6-18 show the lane geometry and study area volumes associated with each of the project alternatives. Because redevelopment of one or more of the mixed-use development sites would not generate new trips as it would provide replacement housing for displaced residents and the remaining site(s) would be constructed between 2020 and 2040, the Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development sites were not analyzed under this 2020 (opening day) scenario.  operations in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; Mitigation Measure 3.6-2 has been incorporated into Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to impacts on intersection operations in 2020.  During subsequent design phases, the project proponent shall reverse the directions of traffic flow on US 50 such that eastbound US 50 would be realigned onto a new alignment along Lake Parkway southeast of existing US 50, and westbound US 50 would remain in place as under existing conditions.  would be needed or are feasible to implement.  Impact 3.6-3: Impacts on roadway segment operations – 2020 (Opening Day) Under the opening day conditions, Alternatives B, D, and E would result in acceptable roadway segment LOS during annual average and summer peak hours.

However, with Alternative C, three roadway segments within the study area (eastbound and westbound existing US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Park Avenue and one-way eastbound US 50 between Park Avenue and Lake Parkway) would be reduced to unacceptable roadway segment LOS. LOS segment operations would remain at acceptable levels for all study area arterial segments with Alternative A.

The opportunity for community revitalization would be a source of reduced VMT, because visitor uses could be concentrated in a compact, pedestrian/bicycle/transit-served urban core, decreasing the need to take vehicle trips to reach some tourism destinations (e.g., hotel to restaurant or entertainment venue trip, retail shopping trips). The realignment, itself, would cause a small, localized increase in VMT for through traffic with Alternatives B, C, and D, because the route of US 50 would be slightly longer around the tourist core than through it; however, its mobility  The design features of Alternatives A, B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the impacts on VMT in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alts B, C, D = B Alts A, E = LTS  No avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement for the purposes of NEPA or to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  NA  Alts B, C, D = B Alts A, E = LTS  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  enhancements and support of planned development in an urban center would be consistent with attaining the regional total VMT threshold (as required by the Lake Tahoe Regional Plan and evaluated in the Regional Plan Update EIS). The realignment of US 50, would remain consistent with the VMT per capita goal of RTP/SCS EIR/EIS Alternative 3 and would support achievement of the Regional Plan VMT requirements, so the beneficial impact of the RTP on regional VMT would be sustained. Alternative A would affect VMT because it would not support revitalization of the tourist core and would retain the same length of US 50 in the corridor. For Alternative E, the existing roadway alignment would remain the same with separation of pedestrians on an elevated structure. It would not support revitalization in the tourist core as effectively as the realignment alternatives and the through-traffic trip length on US 50 would be unchanged. Because redevelopment of one or more of the three mixed-use development sites would not generate new trips as it would provide replacement housing for displaced residents and the remaining site(s) would be constructed between 2020 and 2040, the Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development sites are not analyzed under the 2020 (opening day) scenario.  Impact 3.6-5: Impacts on bicycle and pedestrian facilities – 2020 (Opening Day) Because of their design, Alternatives B, C, D, and E would not disrupt or interfere with existing or planned bicycle/pedestrian facilities; rather, they would enhance the existing infrastructure and create a bicycle and pedestrian network with enhanced connectivity.

Lake Parkway and Montreal Road would be developed as the realigned US 50, either as a four-lane or two-lane roadway, depending on the alternative. A new section of roadway would be built from Montreal Road at Fern Road connecting to existing US 50 near what is now the intersection of US 50 and Pioneer Trail through an existing neighborhood. Under Alternative E, no changes to existing roadways would occur, except the removal of the signalized at-grade pedestrian scramble between Montbleu Resort Casino and Spa and the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. Instead, an elevated pedestrian skywalk structure would be constructed over US 50 through the Casino Core from Stateline Avenue to the north end of the Montbleu Resort Casino. Most effects on scenic quality from implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D would result in a mix of impacts either because no changes in visual conditions would occur, changes that would occur would be visually beneficial, or changes would be compatible with existing conditions. Proposals for the mixed-use development projects would have to undergo their own environmental review once they are defined and submitted for permitting, so it is unlikely that there would be a significant difference between the build alternatives with the transportation improvements alone or with the mixed-use development. Development of Alternative E would result in scenic quality impacts, because it would cause a decrease in the travel route rating for Roadway Travel Unit #32 due to a decline in scenic  further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the degradation of scenic quality and visual character.  Realigning US 50 through the existing Rocky Point residential neighborhood between Pioneer Trail and Montreal Road would cause substantial changes in visual conditions. Realigned US 50 would be designed in accordance with all applicable design standards and guidelines and thus would exhibit a high level of visual quality; however, it would result in significant change in visual character on the neighborhood. The addition of noise barriers could also contribute to the adverse change in visual character. Mitigation Measure 3.7-1b: Mitigate for Changes in Visual Character on Roadway Travel Unit #32 This mitigation measure would apply to Alternative E for purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. The elevated skywalk would be a massive, new, human-made feature within Roadway Travel Unit #32 and would be seen by motorists on US 50 traveling in either direction as they approach the skywalk and they travel beneath it. The visual dominance of the skywalk would cause a decrease in the travel route rating from 13.5 to 10 for Roadway Travel Unit #32, indicating an adverse effect on scenic quality. In views from the road, the skywalk would decrease the intactness and unity of views from the road, and the visual presence of the skywalk structure and its enclosure of the highway would substantially degrade the character of the roadway corridor as experienced by motorists.  To mitigate for this impact, TTD, TRPA, and FHWA could modify the design the elevated skywalk feature to reduce its visual mass by converting it to more narrow overhead pedestrian walkway crossings only. This design modification would avoid impacts on the intactness and  Alternatives B, C, and D, but there are no other feasible mitigation, avoidance, or minimization measures that could further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to scenic quality and visual character.  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  quality from the covering of the road with a pedestrian structure. Effects on visual character associated with Alternatives B, C, and D within the residential neighborhood between Montreal Road and Pioneer Trail and from Alternative E within the tourist core would result in the greatest impacts, because they would substantially degrade visual character in the immediate area and it would not be feasible to reduce the impact to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  unity of views from the road, and would reduce or eliminate degradation of the character of the roadway corridor as experienced by motorists.  Impact 3.7-2: Interference with or disruption of scenic vistas or scenic resources Vertical components of the project, such as supports for traffic signals and light standards, have insufficient mass to substantially disrupt scenic views. However, large objects, depending on their location and the location from which they are viewed, could interfere with scenic views. Alternatives B, C, and D include construction of a pedestrian bridge over realigned US 50 (on Lake Parkway) near the California/Nevada state line. Also, in the neighborhood east of Pioneer Trail, sound walls may be needed along the new section of US 50 to reduce traffic noise on residential properties. Alternative E would involve constructing an elevated pedestrian skywalk over US 50. Large, elevated structures have the potential to block or disrupt scenic vistas or views of individual scenic resources. Implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D would result in minimal impacts on scenic vistas and views of identified scenic resources because no such views would be affected by project features. Any new mixed-use development that might occur with Alternatives B, C, and D would be required by the TRPA Code of Ordinances to avoid impacts to scenic vistas and scenic resources through building design and orientation. The skywalk structure that would be built with Alternative E would interfere with views of two TRPA-listed scenic resources. Alternative A would result in no changes.  Alt A = NI The design features of Alternatives B, C, and D would avoid or minimize the impacts on scenic vistas and scenic resources such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; Mitigation Measure3.7-2 has been incorporated into Alternative E to further reduce to the extent feasible impacts on scenic vistas and scenic resources.  Alt A = NI Alts B, C, D = LTS Alt E = S  Mitigation Measure 3.7-2: Mitigate for Decrease in Visual Quality Rating for Scenic Resources 32.1 and 32.3 This mitigation measure would apply to Alternative E for purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. The proposed skywalk structure that would be constructed as part of Alternative E would have the potential to affect views of scenic vistas and scenic resources, by interfering with views of scenic resources 32.1 and 32.3. The skywalk would cause a decrease in the Scenic Quality rating of these TRPA-listed scenic resources.  To mitigate for this impact, TTD, TRPA, and FHWA could modify the design of the elevated skywalk feature to reduce its visual mass, as described in the Mitigation Measure 3.7-1b. This design modification would reduce the walkway’s interference with views 32.1 and 32.3 and avoid decreasing the Scenic Quality rating of these scenic resources.  Alts A, B, C, D = NA Alt E =  Mitigation Measure 3.7-2 has been incorporated into Alternative E, but there are no other feasible mitigation, avoidance, or minimization measures that could further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to scenic vistas and scenic resources.  Alt A = NI Alts B, C, D = LTS Alt E = SU  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  Impact 3.7-3: Increased light and glare New sources of light can result from exterior lighting or from the headlights of vehicles, while glare results from high-shine surfaces such as building windows (glass) and high-gloss painted surfaces. Alternatives B, C, and D would include new safety lighting (street lights) at intersections of local streets with realigned US 50. The introduction of a new source of light during nighttime hours in these urban settings would not substantially alter the amount of illumination, recognizing the existing night lighting of roadways, parking lots, and commercial areas. Alternatives B, C, and D would also route the western segment of realigned US 50 through an existing residential neighborhood east of Pioneer Trail. The headlights of traffic on the realigned highway could potentially affect residents whose homes border on the realigned US 50. Mixed-use development that could be part of Alternatives B, C, and D would consist of new buildings and new exterior lighting. Standard design practices and regulations in local ordinances and planning documents pertaining to fixed sources of lighting would limit spillover illumination. Alternatives B, C, D, and E would have a less-than-significant impact from fixed sources of light and glare. Alternatives B, C, and D would have a potentially significant impact from headlights of vehicles shining onto residential properties bordering realigned US 50 in the Rocky Point neighborhood. Alternative A would have no new impacts.  Alt A = NI Mitigation Measure 3.7-3 has been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D to further reduce to the extent feasible the light and glare impacts.

A secondary effect of the noise abatement measures would be to block vehicle headlights from intruding onto residential properties. The barriers should be placed along realigned US 50 where private residences border the realigned highway. Such barriers should be constructed of solid material (e.g., wood, brick, adobe, an earthen berm, boulders, or combination thereof). All barriers will be designed to blend into the restored landscape along the highway, to the extent feasible. Ensuring a character consistent with the surrounding area may involve the use of strategically placed boulders, native trees, or other vegetation; the addition of special materials (e.g., wood or stonework) on the façade of the sound wall; and/or a sound wall that is covered in vegetation. The location and design of sound barriers shall adhere to any space requirements for snow removal on the adjacent roadway.  Alts A, E = NA Alts B, C, D = No additional mitigation measures would be needed or are feasible to implement.  Alt A = NI Alts B, C, D, E = LTS   3.8 Cultural Resources            Impact 3.8-1: Change in the significance of historical resources The build alternatives would not affect the NRHP-listed Friday’s Station, NRHP-eligible Pony Express Rider statue, or NRHP-eligible site 26 Do 451/KBG-4.

There are no known archaeological resources that would be damaged or destroyed by the build alternatives (Alternatives B, C, D, and E). Because Alternatives B, C, D, and E would include excavation and other ground-disturbing activities, these alternatives could result in adverse physical effects on unknown archaeological resources.  Alt A = NI Mitigation Measures 3.8-2a, 3.8-2b, and 3.8-2c have been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, D, and E to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to unknown archaeological resources such that there would be No Adverse Effect on unknown archaeological resources; The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to known archaeological resources such that there would be No Effect on known archaeological resources.  Alt A = NI Alts B, C, D, E = PS  Mitigation Measure 3.8-2a: Install an Environmentally Sensitive Area fence The following mitigation would apply to transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for Alternatives B, C, and D, and Alternative E for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. An Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) fence shall be installed to protect the unevaluated portion of the Johnson’s Cut-Off/Pony Express Trail/Lincoln Highway alignment north of the project area. The fence shall be installed from the entrance to Friday’s Station on US 50 to a point 400 feet east of the Johnson’s Cut-Off/Pony Express Trail/Lincoln Highway segment. A sign shall be installed at the east end of the fence to exclude construction personnel access from the area behind the fence. The fence shall be installed in coordination with a qualified archaeologist prior to ground-disturbing activities and shall remain in place until after the project has been completed. The condition of the fence shall be monitored periodically during the course of construction by the archaeologist who supervised its installation. Mitigation Measure 3.8-2b: Conduct archaeological monitoring The following mitigation was included in the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS, which included the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project as one of the TTD Capital Improvement Program projects in the RTP.

Archaeological monitoring shall be conducted in areas where there is likelihood that archaeological remains may be discovered but where those remains are not visible on the surface. Monitoring will not be considered a substitute for efforts to identify and evaluate cultural resources prior to project initiation. Where necessary, the project proponent shall seek Native American input and consultation. Mitigation Measure 3.8-2c: Stop work in the event of an archaeological discovery The following mitigation was included in the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS, which included the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project as one of the TTD Capital Improvement Program projects in the RTP. This mitigation would apply to transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for Alternatives B, C, and D, and Alternative E for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. If potentially significant cultural resources are discovered during ground-disturbing activities associated with individual project preparation, construction, or completion, the project proponent shall require the construction  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  contractor to stop work in that area until a qualified archaeologist can assess the significance of the find, and, if necessary, develop appropriate treatment measures in consultation with TRPA and other appropriate agencies and interested parties. A qualified archaeologist shall follow accepted professional standards in recording any find including submittal of the standard Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) Primary Record forms (Form DPR 523) and location information to the California Historical Resources Information Center office (North Central Information Center) for California projects. The consulting archaeologist shall also evaluate such resources for significance per California Register of Historical Resources eligibility criteria (PRC Section 5024.1; Title 14 CCR Section 4852) for California projects. Consultation with the Nevada State Historic Preservation Officer shall be undertaken for Nevada projects. If the archaeologist determines that the find does not meet the TRPA standards of significance for cultural resources, construction may proceed. If the archaeologist determines that further information is needed to evaluate significance, the lead agency shall be notified and a data recovery plan shall be prepared.  Impact 3.8-3: Accidental discovery of human remains Construction and excavation activities associated with development activities may result in sediment disturbance and removal, which can unearth human remains if they are present.

Degradation of surface water quality could result from construction activities and pollutant loading in surface runoff. Because TRPA, Lahontan RWQCB, and NDEP regulations are in place to minimize erosion and transport of sediment and other pollutants during construction, and appropriate project-specific measures would be defined to secure necessary permits and approvals, project-related impacts would be minimized and would not result in substantial adverse effects on water quality.

Also, TRPA Code provisions would require fertilizer management and snow storage BMPs to prevent potential adverse effect from these activities. In addition, Alternative B, C, and D include several water quality improvements that would resolve preexisting detrimental conditions within the project site and add supplemental capacity to water quality treatment basins above required volumes. Alternative E would minimize the potential effects to water quality by implementing required stormwater infrastructure.

The project would be required to comply with stringent SWRCB, Lahontan RWQCB, NDEP, and TRPA post-construction stormwater controls. Storage, infiltration, and treatment measures are required to minimize runoff flows and volumes and any stormwater discharge would be required to comply with Lahontan RWQCB, NDEP, and TRPA water quality standards and the Lake Tahoe TMDL.

Although Alternatives B, C, and D could involve excavation or construction activities that intercept groundwater, these activities would occur in accordance with TRPA Code requirements and would not alter the flow or direction of groundwater. Finally, although the project site is located near several drinking water wells, the land uses and activities proposed by the project present a minimal threat to these resources. Alternative E also has the potential to intercept groundwater during excavation activities; however, all excavation would occur in accordance with TRPA regulations and would not alter the flow or direction of groundwater.

Alternatives A and E would not result in changes to TRPA-related land coverage.  land coverage environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Impact 3.11-2: Increased erosion and alteration of topography during construction During construction, transportation improvements and replacement housing included in Alternatives B, C, D, and Alternative E would require ground disturbance and soil exposure, which could result in increased erosion and alteration of the existing topography. The total area of temporary and permanent disturbance (including areas that are currently developed or disturbed) would be 56.49 acres for Alternative B, 52.20 acres for Alternative C, 52.39 acres for Alternative D, and 0.79 acre for Alternative E. Because the project site is located in an urban environment, much of the project site has been developed or extensively disturbed.

All transportation improvement components of Alternatives B, C, and D would be designed to meet California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) seismic standards and state-specific, seismic design codes. The construction of the pedestrian bridge in Alternatives B, C, and D would require deep excavation and construction of footings in soils that could be subject to liquefaction. These structures would be subject to rigorous highway safety design standards, which would minimize the potential for seismic hazards. Implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would result in the displacement of housing units that are now outside of the inundation area of a seismically induced seiche wave. Implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would also not have the potential to increase the exposure of people and property to inundation by a seismically-induced seiche wave, because the mixed-use sites are outside the inundation area.

The project site is located in an area with a moderate to high potential for naturally-occurring radon gas, exposure to which has the potential to cause lung cancer. In addition, ADL could be present on and near roadway shoulders. Although the project incorporates best management practices, avoidance measures, and regulatory compliance, through construction of the project, it would be possible that previously unidentified contaminants, such as radon gas or ADL, could be disturbed or encountered by residents and workers. Although the project incorporates best management practices, avoidance measures, and regulatory compliance to reduce the potential for adverse effects, there is a risk of exposure of residents to radon gas and workers to ADL or other unknown contaminants.  Alt A = NI Mitigation Measures 3.12-2a, 3.12-2b, 3.12-2c, and 3.12-2d have been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, D, and E to further reduce to the extent feasible the potential for exposure to recognized environmental conditions.  Alt A = NI Alts B, C, D, E = PS  Mitigation Measure 3.12-2a: Conduct surveys for asbestos-containing materials, aerially deposited lead, and lead-based paints and coatings This mitigation would apply to the transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites associated with Alternatives B, C, and D, and Alternative E for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. 1. Demolition of buildings and roadways containing asbestos and lead-based materials shall require specialized procedures and equipment, and appropriately certified personnel, as detailed in the applicable regulations. Buildings and roadways intended for demolition that were constructed before 1980 shall be surveyed for asbestos, while those constructed before 1971 shall be surveyed for lead.  Prior to construction, all existing road right-of-ways in the project site shall be surveyed for lead contamination because of ADL and use of paint and coatings containing lead. All sampling shall be conducted consistent with applicable Caltrans and NDMV requirements.  2. A demolition plan shall be prepared for any location with positive results for asbestos or lead. The plan will specify how to appropriately contain, remove, and dispose of the asbestos and lead-containing material while meeting all requirements and BMPs to protect human health and the environment. A lead compliance plan shall be prepared by a Certified Industrial Hygienist (consistent with the requirements of Caltrans’ SSP 14-11.07).   Alt A = NA Alts B, C, D, E = No additional mitigation measures would be needed or are feasible to implement.  Alt A = NI Alts B, C, D, E = LTS  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  Prior to demolition, the project applicant shall submit the written plan to the El Dorado County Department of Environmental Management, Hazardous Waste Division, describing the methods to be used to, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) identify locations that could contain hazardous residues; (b) remove plumbing fixtures known to contain, or potentially containing, hazardous materials; (c) determine the waste classification of the debris; (d) package contaminated items and wastes; and (e) identify disposal site(s) permitted to accept such wastes. Demolition shall not occur until the plan has been accepted by the El Dorado County Department of Environmental Management, Hazardous Waste Division and all potentially hazardous components have been removed to the satisfaction of El Dorado County Environmental Health Department staff. The project applicant shall also provide written documentation to the County that lead-based paint and asbestos testing and abatement, as appropriate, have been completed in accordance with applicable state and local laws and regulations. Lead abatement shall include the removal of lead-contaminated soil (i.e., soil with lead concentrations greater than 400 parts per million). 3. Prior to ground disturbance of any soils adjacent to the Tahoe Tom’s Gas Station facility, soil samples shall be collected from the proposed construction footprint at this location to evaluate potential impacts from a petroleum hydrocarbon release that was discovered in 1998.

The construction hazardous materials management plan shall include provisions for agency notification, managing contaminated materials, sampling and analytical requirements, and disposal procedures. The plan shall include identification of construction site BMPs to minimize the potential for water quality impacts.  The construction hazardous materials management plan shall cover, at a minimum, the following:  petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soils and/or groundwater that may be encountered during project construction activities in areas where construction depths exceed 2 feet below ground surface (bgs) in the vicinity of the RECs described above;  soils identified by the ADL surveys as being contaminated by lead within survey area ROWs;  materials identified by the lead-based paint and asbestos-containing materials surveys as contaminated by lead-based paint and asbestos- Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  containing materials within bridge, pipe, and building materials;   guidance for relocation, removal, or repair of hazardous materials storage facilities (USTs or ASTs) that are affected by project construction; and  information on assessment and potential handing of contaminated soils found during relocation. The plan shall include procedures to stop work if evidence of potential hazardous materials or contamination of soils or groundwater is encountered during construction, including the applicable requirements of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and CCR Title 22 regarding the disposal of wastes. Mitigation Measure 3.12-2c: Conduct radon investigation and implement radon-resistant construction techniques This mitigation would apply to mixed-use development sites associated with Alternatives B, C, and D for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Prior to the occupancy of housing units associated with the three future mixed-use development sites, the applicant or construction manager shall retain a licensed radon contractor to determine if radon is detected beyond the 4 pCi/L threshold. If the amount of radon exceeds the established threshold, the applicant shall retain a licensed radon contractor to reduce the radon in the affected residences to below the established threshold. Methods include, but are not limited to, the soil suction radon reduction system, which entails the installation of a vent pipe system and fan that pull radon from beneath the house and vent it to the outside. The radon contractor shall develop clear instructions for proper maintenance of the radon monitoring systems that would be installed in  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  each residence, as well as the radon monitoring and reduction system, if required. The property disclosure statements shall indicate that the site is within an area with a moderate potential for indoor radon levels. Mitigation Measure 3.12-2d: Conduct screening for VECs and, if necessary, conduct sampling and develop and implement remediation measures This mitigation would apply to the mixed-use development sites associated with Alternatives B, C, and D for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Prior to ground disturbance on any parcel intended for human occupancy, the applicant or construction manager shall retain an Environmental Professional as defined in 40 CFR Section 312.10 to perform a screening-level VEC evaluation based on the type of facility, information regarding the type of contaminant and groundwater flow, and the distance from the contaminant to the property to determine whether further study and sampling is warranted. If recommended by the screening, sampling shall be designed and conducted in coordination with DTSC and the CUPA, as appropriate. Based on the results of the sampling, and consistent with standard industry practice, remediation measures shall be developed and implemented to the satisfaction of the appropriate approval agency before building occupancy.  Impact 3.12-3: Exposure of people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury, or death involving wildfires Implementation of all of the build alternatives would result in construction activities associated with the proposed transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing. There would be a temporary, elevated risk of accidental ignition of a wildland fire, because of increased construction activity in a forested area that has a  Alts A, E = NI The design features of Alternatives B, C, and D would avoid or minimize the potential to increase exposure of people or structures to wildland fire.  Alts A, E = NI Alts B, C, D = LTS  No avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement for the purposes of NEPA or to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  NA  Alts A, E = NI Alts B, C, D = LTS  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  moderate to very high fire hazard; however, standard construction practices include provisions to avoid ignitions, so the probability of starting a wildland fire would be very low. Implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D also includes three mixed-use development sites, which could provide replacement housing as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). The mixed-use development could be exposed to potential risk of wildfire because of the siting of mixed-use development within an area containing very high risk of wildfire.  3.13 Air Quality            Impact 3.13-1: Short-term, construction-generated emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursors Construction of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would not exceed EDCAQMD’s ROG threshold. Construction of Alternatives B, C, and D would exceed EDCAQMD’s NOX threshold, and therefore CO emissions could be significant. Construction of Alternative E would not exceed EDCAQMD’s NOX or CO threshold. All build alternatives (Alternatives B through E) could result in excessive fugitive dust emissions. In addition to construction associated with the roadway improvements, construction emissions related to the potential future mixed-use development sites for Alternatives B, C, and D could occur sometime in the future. Construction associated with redeveloping the mixed-use development sites alone with Alternatives B, C, and D would not exceed EDCAQMD’s thresholds for NOX, ROG, or CO, but could result in excessive fugitive dust emissions.  Alt A = NI Mitigation Measures 3.13-1a and 3.13-1b have been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, D, and E to further reduce to the extent feasible short-term construction-generated emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursors.  Alt A = NI Alts B, C, D, E = S  Mitigation Measure 3.13-1a: Reduce short-term construction-related NOX emissions  This mitigation would apply to Alternatives B, C, and D for purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. For all construction activities, the project proponent shall ensure that construction contractors comply with the following on-site construction measures to reduce emissions of NOX:  The prime construction contractor shall submit to EDCAQMD a comprehensive inventory (e.g., make, model, year, emission rating) of all the heavy-duty off-road equipment (50 horsepower of greater) that would be used for 40 or more hours, in aggregate, during a construction season. If any new equipment is added after submission of the inventory, the prime contractor shall contact EDCAQMD before the new equipment is used. At least three business days before the use of subject heavy-duty off-road equipment, the project representative shall provide EDCAQMD with the anticipated construction timeline including start date, name, and phone  Alt A = NA Alts B, C, D, E = No additional mitigation measures would be needed or are feasible to implement.  Alt A = NI Alts B, C, D, E = LTS  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  number of the property owner, project manager, and onsite foreman.  Before approval of Grading Permits, the construction contractor shall submit for EDCAQMD approval, a written calculation demonstrating that the heavy-duty (> 50 horsepower) off-road vehicles to be used in the construction project, including owned, leased, and subcontractor vehicles, will achieve a project wide fleet-average 20 percent reduction in NOX emissions as compared to ARB statewide fleet average emissions. Acceptable options for reducing emissions may include use of late model engines, low-emission diesel products, alternative fuels, engine retrofit technology, after-treatment products, and/or other options as they become available. The calculation shall be provided using EDCAQMD’s Construction Mitigation Calculator.  Mitigation Measure 3.13-1b: Reduce short-term construction-related fugitive dust (PM10 and PM 2.5) This mitigation would apply to Alternatives B, C, D, and E. To reduce fugitive dust emissions during all construction activities involving earth-moving activities, the prime construction contractor shall implement all available fugitive dust control measures as indicated in Table C.4 and C.5 (Table 3.13-8) in Appendix C-1 of the El Dorado County Air Pollution Control District CEQA Guide (2002) and included below (See Attachment 1 to Table S-1).  Impact 3.13-2: Consistency with air quality plans and regional transportation conformity The US Department of Transportation (DOT) made a CAA conformity determination for the TMPO’s 2012 RTP/SCS (i.e., Mobility 2035) on January 28, 2013 (DOT 2013).

The 2015 FTIP met all air quality conformity requirements when approved. The design concept and scope of Alternatives B, C, and D are consistent with the project description in the applicable RTP/SCS and FTIP. Although Alternative E would not be consistent with the design concept and scope described in the RTP/SCS, this alternative would not increase regional VMT. Therefore, implementation of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would be consistent with the assumptions in the regional emissions analysis in the RTP and would conform to the SIP and meet Federal Conformity Requirements. There would be no regional increase in mobile-source emissions and the region would continue to conform to applicable air quality plans.  plans and regional transportation conformity such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Impact 3.13-3: Project-level transportation conformity with respect to localized, long-term mobile-source carbon monoxide emissions Though implementation of all of the build alternatives (Alternatives B through E) and the future potential mixed-use developments associated with Alternatives B, C, and D would result in changes to the roadway network and traffic patterns in the study area, implementation of any of the alternatives with or without the mixed-use developments would not result in increases in traffic such that quantitative screening criteria for local CO emissions would be triggered during project operations. Implementation of any of the alternatives, including Alternative A, and associated mixed-use developments would not result in increased concentrations of CO that would expose sensitive receptors to unhealthy levels.  The design features of Alternatives A, B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize localized, long-term mobile-source carbon monoxide such that project-level conformity is met and no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alts A, B, C, D, E, = LTS  No avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement for the purposes of NEPA or to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  NA  Alts A, B, C, D, E, = LTS  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  Impact 3.13-4: Exposure of sensitive receptors to Mobile Source Air Toxics/Toxic Air Contaminants Construction-related activities would result in short-term project-generated emissions of diesel PM under all build alternatives. However, construction would be relatively short in duration (i.e., up to 3 years), would not occur in the same location for extended periods of time, and with incorporated mitigation exhaust emissions would not be significant. As such, construction activities associated with Alternatives B, C, D, and E, with or without the mixed-use development sites, would not expose sensitive receptors to excessive levels of MSATs/TACs.  In accordance with FHWA and Caltrans guidance, projects that do not result in more than 140,000 AADT have a low potential to result in impacts from MSAT. Guidance provided by ARB indicates that elevated health risks from operational exposure to diesel exhaust is associated primarily with high volume roadways of 100,000 ADT or more. Implementation of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would result in less than 40,000 ADT during the summer peak season for all affected roadway segments. Therefore, implementation of Alternatives B, C, D, and E is not anticipated to result in a significant health risk impact to sensitive receptors in the study area. Implementation of Alternative A would not result in any new sensitive receptors placed in close proximity to existing sources of MSAT/TAC emissions and no sources of MSAT/TAC emissions would be placed in close proximity to sensitive land uses.  The design features of Alternatives A, B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the exposure of sensitive receptors to air toxics such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alts A, B, C, D, E, = LTS  No avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement for the purposes of NEPA or to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  NA  Alts A, B, C, D, E, = LTS  3.14 Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change            Impact 3.14-1: GHG emissions and consistency with the Regional Transportation Plan Implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D would result in realignment of US 50 and community revitalization that would be consistent with implementation of the RTP/SCS, which aims  The design features of Alternatives A, B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize GHG emissions such that no additional mitigation  Alts B, C, D = B Alts A, E = LTS  No avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement for the purposes of NEPA or to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  NA  Alts B, C, D = B Alts A, E = LTS  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  to achieve regional VMT (and associated GHG emissions) reduction targets. Therefore, Alternatives B, C, and D would help implement the RTP’s impact on regional VMT and related GHG emissions. There would be nominal construction-related GHG emissions of less than 1,100 MTCO2e/year for all the build alternatives. Implementation of Alternative A would not support the revitalization of the tourist core; it would retain the existing roadway system as is and existing traffic conditions, including existing levels of congestion and traffic flow but would not result in an increase in GHG emissions relative to existing conditions. For Alternative E, the existing roadway alignment would remain the same with separation of pedestrians on an elevated structure. It would not support revitalization in the tourist core as effectively as the realignment alternatives and the through-traffic trip length on US 50 would be unchanged as would VMT and related GHG emissions.  measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Impact 3.14-2: Vulnerability to climate change risks Climate change is expected to result in a variety of effects in the study area including increased frequency and intensity of wildfires; changes to timing and intensity of precipitation resulting in increased risk from landslides associated with ground saturation, increased stormwater runoff, and increased intensity of storm events that result in increased snow loading and high winds. However, there are numerous programs and policies in place, as well as design measures that would protect against these climate change risks.  Alt A = NI The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize vulnerability to climate change risks such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alt A = NI Alts B, C, D, Alt E = LTS  No avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement for the purposes of NEPA or to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  NA  Alt A = NI Alts B, C, D, Alt E = LTS  3.15 Noise and Vibration            Impact 3.15-1: Short-term construction noise levels Alternative A would not include any noise-generating construction or demolition activity.

The study shall also determine whether nearby residential dwellings, tourist accommodation units, and/or commercial land uses would experience levels of ground vibration that exceed FTA’s vibration standard of 80 VdB for human response.  The study shall also include a geotechnical inspection of all buildings and structures located within 100 feet of locations where impact pile driving would occur or within 60 feet where sonic pile driving would occur. The inspection shall document pre-existing conditions, including any pre-existing structural damage. The pre- Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  inspection survey of the buildings shall be completed with the use of photographs, videotape, or visual inventory, and shall include inside and outside locations. All existing cracks in walls, floors, driveways shall be documented with sufficient detail for comparison during and upon completion of pile driving activities to determine whether new actual vibration damage has occurred. The results of both surveys shall be provided to the project proponent for review and acceptance of conclusions. Should damage occur during construction, construction operations shall be halted until the problem activity can be identified. Once identified, the problem activity shall be modified to eliminate the problem and protect the adjacent buildings. Any damage to nearby buildings shall be repaired back to the pre-existing condition at the expense of the project proponent. The study shall also identify site-specific measures to lessen the potential for structural damage and to reduce the potential for human response from ground vibration associated with construction of the skywalk and the project proponent shall require construction contractor(s) to implement the measures identified in the study. Such measures shall include, but are not limited to, the following:  All necessary piles shall be driven with sonic pile drivers instead of impact pile drivers, unless sonic pile driving is determined to be infeasible by a qualified geotechnical engineer;   To the extent feasible, project structures shall be designed so that impact-driven piles are placed a sufficient distance from nearby buildings and structures to minimize the potential to cause structural damage (e.g., 100 feet, assuming normal propagation conditions), and sonic-driven piles are  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  placed at least 60 feet from nearby buildings and structures to minimize the potential to cause structural damage (e.g., 60 feet, assuming normal propagation conditions);   To the extent feasible, project structures shall be designed so that impact-driven piles are placed a sufficient distance from residences and tourist accommodation units to minimize human response (e.g., 300 feet, assuming normal propagation conditions), and sonic-driven piles are placed a sufficient distance from nearby buildings and structures to minimize human response (e.g., 175 feet, assuming normal propagation conditions);   To further reduce pile-driving ground vibration impacts, holes shall be predrilled to the maximum feasible depth. This would reduce the number of blows and/or the amount of time required to seat the pile, and would concentrate the pile-driving activity closer to the ground where noise can be attenuated more effectively;   Pile driving, earth moving, and ground-disturbance activities shall be phased so as not to occur simultaneously in areas close to off-site sensitive receptors. The total vibration level produced could be substantially less when each vibration source is operated separately;   Designate a disturbance coordinator and post that person’s telephone number conspicuously around the skywalk construction site and provide to nearby residences. The disturbance coordinator shall receive all public complaints and be responsible for determining the cause of the complaint and implementing any feasible measures to alleviate the problem. The contact information of the disturbance  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  coordinator shall also be provided to the owners of all properties for which a pre-inspection survey is performed; and   Provide advanced notice to owners of all residential land uses, tourist accommodations, and commercial land uses located within 300 feet of where impact pile driving would take place or within 175 feet of where sonic pile driving would take place. This noticing shall inform the recipients of when and where pile driving would occur and the types of measures being implemented to lessen the impact at potentially affected receptors. This noticing shall also provide the contact information for the designated disturbance coordinator.  Impact 3.15-3: Traffic noise exposure at existing receptors Alternative A would not result in changes to traffic noise levels along US 50 or local roadways.  With Alternatives B, C, and D the 65 CNEL contours along the realigned segments of US 50 would not extend more than 300 feet from the roadway edge for any of the alternatives. Therefore, the Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacity established by TRPA for the transportation corridor would not be exceeded with Alternatives B, C, and D. With Alternatives B, C, and D one or more noise-sensitive receptors would be exposed to noise levels greater than the applicable FHWA noise abatement criteria by the design year (i.e., 2040).  With Alternatives B, C, and D multiple existing noise-sensitive receptors in California would experience increases in traffic noise that are considered substantial by 23 CFR 772 criteria (i.e., increase of 12 dB or more).  With Alternatives B, C, D, and E one or more existing noise-sensitive receptors located outside of a TRPA transportation  Alt A = NI Mitigation Measures 3.15-3a, 3-15-3b, and 3.15-3c have been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D, and Mitigation Measure 3.15-3d has been incorporated into Alternative E, to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels.  Alt A = NI Alts B, C, D, E = S  Mitigation Measure 3.15-3a: Implement traffic noise reduction measures to reduce traffic noise exposure at affected receptors The following noise abatement measures would apply to the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use redevelopment sites for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Performance Requirements Traffic noise reduction measures shall be implemented to achieve the following: 1. Ensure that Receptors 80, 88, 89, 90, and 91 are not exposed to an average daily traffic noise level that exceeds the land use-based 55 CNEL threshold established in TRPA’s Pioneer/Ski Run Plan Area Statement 092 (TRPA 2002c:3) and that Receptor 136 is not exposed to an average daily traffic noise level that exceeds the land use-based 65 CNEL threshold established in TRPA’s Tourist Core Area Plan (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2013:5-3 to 5-4)  Alt A = NI Alt E = No additional mitigation measures would be needed or are feasible to implement. Alts B, C, D = Mitigation Measures 3.15-3a, 3.15-3b, and 3.15-3c have been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D, respectively, but there are no other feasible mitigation, avoidance, or minimization measures that could further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to traffic noise.  Alt A = NI Alts B, C, D = SU Alt E= LTS   Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  corridor would be exposed to noise levels that exceed TRPA’s applicable land use-based CNEL threshold. With Alternatives B, C, D, and E multiple noise-sensitive receptors would be exposed to traffic noise levels that exceed the applicable traffic noise standard established by the City of South Lake Tahoe.  With Alternatives B, C, and D multiple noise-sensitive receptors would experience a CNEL increase equal to or greater than 3 dB, which is a TRPA significance criterion and a CEQA significance criterion for receptors located in California. With Alternatives B, C, D, and E one or more existing hotels would be exposed to interior noise levels that exceed the interior noise standard of 45 CNEL.  These exceedances would occur under existing-plus-project conditions (2020) and/or under cumulative-plus-project conditions (2040) with a considerable contribution of the exceedance directly resulting from the implementation of the selected alternative. The intensity of these impacts would not be substantially different with development of the replacement housing at the mixed-use redevelopment sites with Alternatives B, C, and D.  under cumulative conditions. These land use-based CNEL thresholds apply at all portions of these receptor parcels that are more than 300 feet from the edge of US 50. This performance requirement shall take priority over Performance Requirements 3 and 4; 2. TTD shall offer to retrofit the South Shore Inn (Receptor 55) sufficiently to ensure that its ambient interior noise levels do not exceed 45 CNEL with windows and doors closed. However, the owners of the motel may choose to refuse this offer; 3. To the extent feasible, reduce traffic noise levels at those receptors identified in Table 3.15-11 that would experience traffic noise levels that exceed or approach the applicable NAC and/or experience a traffic noise level increase greater than Caltrans’s incremental increase criterion of 12 dB. For NEPA purposes, the feasibility of achieving this performance requirement can be based on the Noise Abatement Decision Report prepared for the project (Caltrans2016), which was prepared pursuant to guidance in Caltrans’s Traffic Noise Analysis Protocol for New Highway Construction and Reconstruction Projects (Caltrans 2011) and 23 CFR 772; and 4. To the extent feasible, reduce traffic noise levels at those receptors identified in Table 3.15-11 that would experience a traffic noise level that exceeds the applicable local noise standard (established by the City of South Lake Tahoe), and/or would experience a traffic noise level increase of 3 dB or greater. Noise Reduction Features Noise-reduction features may include, but are not limited to, any combination of the following:    Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable   Paving the nearby segment of roadway with rubberized hot-mix asphalt (RHMA) or equivalent surface treatment with known noise-reducing properties on top of the roadway surface. The RHMA overlay shall be designed with appropriate thickness and rubber component quantity (typically 15 percent by weight of the total blend), such that traffic noise levels are reduced by an average of 4 to 6 dB (noise levels vary depending on travel speeds, meteorological conditions, and pavement quality) as compared to noise levels generated by vehicle traffic traveling on standard asphalt. RHMA has been found to achieve this level of noise reduction in other parts of California (Sacramento County 1999). Pavement will require more frequent than normal maintenance and repair to maintain its noise attenuation effectiveness.   Installation of outdoor sound barriers between affected receptors and the roadway segments that are the predominant noise source at the receptors. The sound barriers must be constructed of solid material (e.g., wood, brick, adobe, an earthen berm, boulders, or combination thereof). The reflectivity of each sound barrier will be minimized to ensure that traffic noise reflected off the barrier does not contribute to an exceedance of applicable TRPA CNEL standards at other receptors. The level of sound reflection from a barrier can be minimized with a textured or absorptive surface or with vegetation on or next to the barrier. Scenic quality factors will be taken into account during design, such as using more natural materials (e.g., berms and boulders) to reduce the visible mass of a wall. Mitigation Measure 3.7-3 also proposes the use of a sound barrier to attenuate impacts from  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  headlights shining onto residential properties and describes details to ensure the barriers would not cause negative visual impacts (see Section 3.7, Visual Resources/Aesthetics). All barriers will be designed to blend into the restored landscape along the highway, to the extent feasible. Ensuring a character consistent with the surrounding area may involve the use of strategically placed boulders, native trees, or other vegetation; the addition of special materials (e.g., wood or stonework) on the façade of the sound wall; and/or a sound wall that is covered in vegetation. The location and design of sound barriers shall adhere to any space requirements for snow removal on the adjacent roadway. If desired a sound barrier can be divided into two overlapping segments with a gap in the overlapped portion to provide pedestrian access from one side to the other. The specific location, length, height, and design of noise barriers for Alternative B must be defined during engineering design development. It is not feasible to provide engineering details of noise barriers prior to the initiation of preliminary engineering for the transportation improvements. For conceptual planning purposes, however, based on the environmental planning-level noise analysis in this document, the approximate location and height of noise barriers for Alternative B are as follows:  Barriers would need to be built on both the north and south sides of the realigned US 50 alignment to protect affected residences behind them. The approximate length is estimated to be in the range of 1,000 to 1,200 feet on each side of the highway. The height needed for an  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  approximately 5 dB attenuation would be between 6 to 8 feet above the road surface. Noise barriers would be entirely within the public right-of-way.  The conceptual extent of the south barrier would be from the intersection of realigned US 50 and Pioneer Trail (near the existing 90-degree bend in Primrose Road close to Pioneer Trail) east to the curve of the highway onto the Montreal Road alignment (near the existing intersection of Echo Road and Montreal Road).   The conceptual extent of the north barrier would be from the intersection of realigned US 50 and Pioneer Trail (near the existing intersection of Moss Road and Pioneer Trail) east to beyond Fern Road (near the existing corner of the back parking area of Heavenly Village Center).   Reduced vehicle speeds through posted speed limits, advisory signs, and/or design features that serve as traffic calming elements (e.g., median barrier, center islands, and raised crosswalks). The design of any special traffic-calming features shall not prevent the ability to provide adequate snow removal of any surfaces used for driving, walking, or biking.   Offer to the property owners of residences, motels/hotels, or other tourist accommodation units where the interior noise levels would exceed 45 CNEL, increased noise insulation of exterior walls to improve the Sound Transmission Class (STC) of those walls, including but not limited to added insulation, upgrades to drywall, acoustical sound absorption panels, new windows, and new exterior siding. For residences or tourist  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  accommodation units that do not currently have air conditioning, install an air conditioning system if necessary to ensure that residents can close all windows and doors during nighttime hours and maintain adequate interior comfort.   Acquire properties where the noise level would exceed TRPA thresholds, applicable Caltrans noise abatement criteria, and/or applicable local noise standards; or where traffic noise levels would increase by 3 dB CNEL or greater. Acquisition of additional properties shall only occur if other feasible noise reduction measures are not available to achieve the applicable standards or minimize traffic noise increases to less than 3 dB CNEL. Selection and Design Process  The selection and design of specific traffic noise reduction measures shall be supported by a site-specific noise abatement assessment conducted by a qualified acoustical engineer or consultant selected by the project proponent. This study shall be fully funded by the project proponent and approved by the project proponent, TRPA, and Caltrans prior to project construction. If necessary to support the effectiveness of selected noise reduction measures, the site-specific noise abatement assessment may involve additional sound level measurements and/or the use of detailed site-specific modeling with software such as FHWA’s Traffic Noise Model (FHWA 2006), SoundPLAN (SoundPLAN 2015) or CadnaA (DataKustik 2015).  For those receptors predicted to experience an exceedance of NEPA significance criteria for traffic noise, as identified in Table 3.15-11, the feasibility of constructing a sound barrier, for NEPA purposes, shall be based on the results of the Noise Abatement Decision  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  Report (Caltrans 2016), which was prepared pursuant to guidance in Caltrans’s Traffic Noise Analysis Protocol for New Highway Construction and Reconstruction Projects (Caltrans 2011) and 23 CFR 772.  TTD shall prepare a study supplemental to the Noise Abatement Decision Report to identify all necessary measures to ensure attainment of all applicable TRPA land use-based CNEL thresholds. The supplemental study shall also identify all feasible measures to reduce traffic noise increases to less than 3 dB and/or reduce traffic noise levels to less than the applicable local noise standards, with specific attention to the application of the City’s noise standard at the outdoor activity areas of residential and tourist accommodation land uses. In addition, the supplemental study shall identify, and TTD shall select, the set of feasible noise reduction measures that would benefit the most receptors and prioritize the attainment of applicable NAC ahead of the applicable local noise standard. Mitigation Measure 3.15-3b: Implement traffic noise reduction measures to reduce traffic noise exposure at affected receptors The following noise abatement measures would apply to the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Performance Requirements Traffic noise reduction measures shall be implemented to achieve the following: 1. Ensure that Receptor 136 is not exposed to an average daily traffic noise level that exceeds the land use-based 65 CNEL threshold established in TRPA’s Tourist Core Area Plan (City of South Lake Tahoe and  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  TRPA 2013:5-3 to 5-4) under cumulative conditions. This performance requirement shall take priority over Performance Requirements 2, 3 and 4; 2. TTD shall offer to retrofit the South Shore Inn (Receptor 55) sufficiently to ensure that its ambient interior noise level does not exceed 45 CNEL with windows and doors closed. However, the owner of the motel may choose to refuse this offer; 3. To the extent feasible, reduce traffic noise levels at those receptors identified in Table 3.15-12 that would experience a traffic noise level that exceeds or approaches the applicable NAC and/or experience a traffic noise level increase greater than Caltrans’s incremental increase criterion of 12 dB. For NEPA purposes, the feasibility of achieving this performance requirement can be based on the Noise Abatement Decision Report prepared for the project (Caltrans 2016), which was prepared pursuant to guidance in Caltrans’s Traffic Noise Analysis Protocol for New Highway Construction and Reconstruction Projects (Caltrans 2011) and 23 CFR 772; and 4. To the extent feasible reduce traffic noise levels at those receptors identified in Table 3.15-12 that would experience a traffic noise level that exceeds the applicable local noise standard (established by the City of South Lake Tahoe), and/or would experience a traffic noise level increase of 3 dB or greater. Noise Reduction Features Noise reduction features may include, but are not limited to, the same features identified for Alternative B in Mitigation Measure 3.15-3a.  The specific location, length, height, and design of noise barriers for Alternative C must be defined during  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  engineering design development and, as described for Alternative B, adhere to Mitigation Measure 3.7-3 to avoid negative visual impacts (see Section 3.7, Visual Resources/Aesthetics). It is not feasible to provide engineering details of noise barriers prior to the initiation of preliminary engineering for the transportation improvements. For conceptual planning purposes, however, based on the environmental planning-level noise analysis in this document, the approximate location and height of noise barriers for Alternative C are as follows (similar to Alternative B):   Barriers would need to be built on both the north and south sides of the realigned US 50 alignment to protect affected residences behind them. The approximate length is estimated to be in the range of 1,000 to 1,200 feet on each side of the highway. The height needed for an approximately 5 dB attenuation would be between 6 to 8 feet above the road surface. Noise barriers would be entirely within the public right-of-way.   The conceptual extent of the south barrier would be from the intersection of realigned US 50 and Pioneer Trail (near the existing 90-degree bend in Primrose Road close to Pioneer Trail) east to the curve of the highway onto the Montreal Road alignment (near the existing intersection of Echo Road and Montreal Road).   The conceptual extent of the north barrier would be from the intersection of realigned US 50 and Pioneer Trail (near the existing intersection of Moss Road and Pioneer Trail) east to beyond Fern Road (near the existing corner of the back parking area of Heavenly Village Center).    Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  Selection and Design Process The selection and design of specific traffic noise reduction measures to reduce traffic noise impacts under Alternative C shall adhere to the same requirements identified for Alternative B in Mitigation Measure 3.15-5a. Mitigation Measure 3.15-3c: Implement traffic noise reduction measures to reduce traffic noise exposure at affected receptors The following noise abatement measures would apply to the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Performance Requirements Traffic noise reduction measures shall be implemented to achieve the following:  1. Ensure that Receptors 30, 97, and 98 are not exposed to an average daily traffic noise level that exceeds the land use-based 55 CNEL threshold established in TRPA’s Pioneer/Ski Run Plan Area Statement 092 (TRPA 2002c:3) and that Receptor 136 is not exposed to an average daily traffic noise level that exceeds the land use-based 65 CNEL threshold established in TRPA’s Tourist Core Area Plan (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2013:5-3 to 5-4). These land use-based CNEL thresholds apply to all portions of these receptor parcels that are more than 300 feet from the edge of US 50. Also ensure that Receptor 29 is not exposed to more than its existing noise level of 65 CNEL under cumulative-plus-Alternative D conditions, which currently exceeds the TRPA land use-based noise threshold of 55 CNEL established in PAS 092 Pioneer/Ski Run (TRPA 2002c:3) and is expected to be exposed to 65 CNEL  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  under cumulative-no-project conditions. This performance requirement shall take priority over Performance Requirements 2, 3, and 4; 2. TTD shall offer to retrofit the Trailhead Motel (Receptor 20) with sufficient noise insulation to ensure that its ambient interior noise levels do not exceed 45 CNEL with windows and doors closed. However, the owners of the motel may choose to refuse this offer; 3. To the extent feasible reduce traffic noise levels at Receptors 42, 68, 71, 83, and 84 so they would not experience a traffic noise level that exceeds or approaches the applicable NAC and/or experience a traffic noise level increase greater than Caltrans’s incremental increase criterion of 12 dB. For NEPA purposes, the feasibility of achieving this performance requirement can be based on the Noise Abatement Decision Report prepared for the project (Caltrans 2016), which was prepared pursuant to guidance in Caltrans’s Traffic Noise Analysis Protocol for New Highway Construction and Reconstruction Projects (Caltrans 2011) and 23 CFR 772 and is included in Appendix E to the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS; and 4. To the extent feasible reduce traffic noise levels at those receptors identified in Table 3.15-13 that would experience a traffic noise level that exceeds the applicable local noise standard established by the City of South Lake Tahoe, and/or would experience a traffic noise level increase greater than 3 dB. Noise Reduction Features Noise reduction features may include, but are not limited to, the same features identified for Alternative B in Mitigation Measure 3.15-3a.   Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  Noise analysis indicates the need for a barrier on the south side of the relocated highway for Alternative D. The specific location, length, height, and design of noise barrier for Alternative D must be defined during engineering design development and, as described for Alternative B, adhere to Mitigation Measure 3.7-3 to avoid negative visual impacts (see Section 3.7, Visual Resources/Aesthetics). It is not feasible to provide engineering details of a noise barrier prior to the initiation of preliminary engineering for the transportation improvements. For conceptual planning purposes, however, based on the environmental planning-level noise analysis in this document, the approximate location and height of the noise barrier for Alternative D are as follows:  A barrier would need to be built on the south side of the realigned US 50 alignment to protect affected residences behind it. The approximate length is estimated to be in the range of 800 to 1,000 feet. The height needed for an approximately 5 dB attenuation would be between 6 to 8 feet above the road surface. The noise barrier would be entirely within the public right-of-way. The conceptual extent of the south barrier would be from the intersection of realigned US 50 and Pioneer Trail (near the existing intersection of Echo Road and Pioneer Trail) east to the curve of the highway onto the Montreal Road alignment (near the existing corner of the Heavenly Village Center parking lot).   If the existing residential land uses along Fern Road (represented by Receptors 96, 97, and 98) are not replaced with mixed-use redevelopment prior to completion of the realigned US 50 alignment, then a barrier would also need to be built on the north side of the realigned US 50 alignment to protect  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  these affected residences. The approximate length of the barrier on the north side of the realigned US 50 alignment is estimated to be approximately 600 to 800 feet. Selection and Design Process The selection and design of specific traffic noise reduction measures to reduce traffic noise impacts under Alternative D shall adhere to the same requirements identified for Alternative B in Mitigation Measure 3.15-5a. Mitigation Measure 3.15-3d: Implement traffic noise reduction measures to reduce traffic noise exposure at affected receptors  The following noise abatement measures would apply for Alternative E for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Performance Requirements Traffic noise reduction measures shall be implemented to achieve the following:  1. Ensure that implementation of Alternative E does not contribute to an exceedance of the land use-based 65 CNEL threshold established in TRPA’s Tourist Core Area Plan (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2013:5-3 to 5-4) at Receptor 136 under cumulative conditions. This means that noise reduction measures shall be implemented to reduce the traffic noise level by a minimum of 1 dB under the cumulative-plus-Alternative E condition. (This performance requirement would also ensure that Alternative E does not contribute to an exceedance of the 65 CNEL transportation noise standard established by the City of South Lake Tahoe.) This performance requirement shall take priority over Performance Requirements 2 and 3;  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  2. Reduce exterior traffic noise levels at Receptors 20, 99, 102, 107, 135, and 136 by a minimum of 1 dB to offset the contribution by Alternative E under cumulative conditions to an exceedance of the 65 CNEL standard established by the City of South Lake Tahoe for these land uses; and 3. TTD shall offer to retrofit the Trailhead Motel (Receptor 20) and the Park Tahoe Aspen Court (Receptor 107) sufficiently to ensure that its ambient interior noise levels do not exceed 45 CNEL with windows and doors closed. However, the owners of these motels may choose to refuse this offer. Noise Reduction Features Noise reduction features may include, but are not limited to, the same features identified for Alternative B in Mitigation Measure 3.15-3a. Selection and Design Process The selection and design of specific traffic noise reduction measures to reduce traffic noise impacts under Alternative E shall adhere to the same requirements identified for Alternative B in Mitigation Measure 3.15-5a.  Impact 3.15-4: Noise/land use compatibility of mixed-use redevelopment sites Alternatives A and E would not include the redevelopment of any areas within the project site that would expose new land uses to excessive noise levels. With Alternatives B, C, and D, the mixed-use redevelopment sites would not be located where they would be exposed to noise levels that exceed TRPA transportation corridor contour-based noise thresholds or TRPA land-use based noise thresholds. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant for purposes of TRPA threshold compliance.   Alts A, E = NI Mitigation Measure 3.15-4 has been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D to further reduce to the extent feasible the potential to expose land uses to an incompatible noise environment.  Alts A, E = NI Alts B, C, D = PS  Mitigation Measure 3.15-4: Implement noise protection measures to ensure that outdoor activity areas on the mixed-use redevelopment sites are not exposed to noise levels greater than 60 CNEL The following noise abatement measures would apply to the Alternative B, C, and D mixed-use development sites for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Performance Requirement Developers of each mixed-use redevelopment site shall be required to ensure that ambient traffic noise levels do not exceed 60 CNEL at all common outdoor activity areas (not including parking lots or walkways between parking lots  Alts A, E = NA Alts B, C, D = No additional mitigation measures would be needed or are feasible to implement.  Alts A, E = NI Alts B, C, D = LTS  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  Common outdoor activity areas could be included on the mixed-use redevelopment sites that would potentially be developed under Alternatives B, C, and D.

This performance standard shall be achieved at each site prior to occupancy of any of the housing units and under the cumulative-plus-project condition for Alternatives B, C, and D.  Noise Reduction Features Measures to reduce noise exposure levels may include, but are not limited to, any combination of the following:  Setting back common outdoor activity areas as far as possible from the nearest segment(s) of US 50;   Strategically locating buildings to shield common outdoor activity areas from noise generated by traffic on the nearby segment(s) of US 50. An example of this type of design layout exists at the existing Forest Suites Resort on the corner of Lake Parkway and Heavenly Village Way;   Installing outdoor sound barriers on the redevelopment property between the outdoor activity areas and the nearby segment(s) of US 50. The sound barriers must be constructed of solid material (e.g., wood, brick, adobe, an earthen berm, boulders, or combination thereof). The reflectivity of each sound barrier shall be minimized to ensure that traffic noise reflected off the barrier does not contribute to an exceedance of applicable noise standards at other off-site receptors. The level of sound reflection from a barrier can be minimized with a textured or absorptive surface or with vegetation on or next to the barrier. All barriers shall blend into the overall landscape and have an aesthetically pleasing appearance that agrees with the character of the surrounding area, and not become the dominant visual element of the area.

The study for each site shall be fully funded by the applicant seeking to develop the site and approved by City staff prior to project construction. If necessary to support the effectiveness of selected noise reduction measures, the site-specific noise abatement assessment may involve additional sound level measurements and/or the use of detailed site-specific modeling with software such as FHWA’s Traffic Noise Model (FHWA 2006), SoundPLAN (SoundPLAN 2015) or CadnaA (DataKustik 2015).  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  3.16 Biological Environment            Impact 3.16-1: Disturbance or loss of common vegetation communities and wildlife habitats With three of the build alternatives (Alternatives B, C, and D), project implementation would result in the removal or disturbance of 0.5 to 1.7 acres of common natural vegetation communities and habitats, including Jeffrey pine and low sagebrush. Because these habitats are locally and regionally common and abundant, and the project site is presently affected by high levels of commercial/urban, residential, and recreational uses, none of these build alternatives would substantially reduce the size, continuity, or integrity of any common vegetation community or habitat type. With the no-build alternative (Alternative A) or Alternative E, no project-related removal of common vegetation communities would occur.  Alts A, E = NI The design features of Alternative B, C, and D would avoid or minimize the disturbance or loss of common vegetation communities and wildlife habitats.  Alts A, E = NI Alts B, C, D = LTS  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  NA  Alts A, E = NI Alts B, C, D = LTS  Impact 3.16-2: Disturbance or loss of sensitive habitats (jurisdictional wetlands, riparian vegetation, SEZ, aquatic habitat) Implementing Alternatives B, C, and D would result in direct removal and disturbance of sensitive habitats, including waters of the United States, waters of the state, riparian habitat, and SEZs.

However, the preliminary delineation has not been verified by USACE. Additionally, because the delineation was completed more than 5 years before project construction, it is considered expired, and will need to be repeated prior to permit application and approval.  Before the start of on-site construction activities on any potentially affected jurisdictional resource, a qualified biologist will survey the project site for sensitive natural communities. Sensitive natural communities or habitats are those of special concern to resource agencies or those that are afforded specific consideration, based on Section 404 of the CWA, Sections 1600 et seq. of the California Fish and Game Code, and other applicable regulations. If sensitive natural communities or habitats that are afforded specific consideration, based on Section 404 of the CWA are determined to be present, a delineation of waters of the United States, including wetlands that would be affected by the project, will be prepared by a qualified biologist through the formal  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  Section 404 wetland delineation process. The delineation will be submitted to and verified by USACE. If, based on the verified delineation, it is determined that fill of waters of the United States would result from implementation of the project, authorization for such fill will be secured from USACE through the Section 404 permitting process. The acreage of riparian habitat (deciduous riparian vegetation) and wetlands that would be removed or disturbed during project implementation will be quantified and replaced or restored/enhanced in accordance with USACE and TRPA regulations, which include meeting the no-net-loss standard in accordance with USACE requirements. Habitat restoration, enhancement, and/or replacement will be at a location and by methods agreeable to USACE as determined during the permitting processes for CWA Section 404 and by TRPA during the permitting process for SEZ. In addition, on the California side of the study area, if any project activities would affect aquatic resources and associated riparian habitats subject to regulation by CDFW under Sections 1600 et seq. of the California Fish and Game Code (i.e., the bed, channel, or bank of any river, stream, or lake in California that supports wildlife resources), the project proponent shall consult with CDFW to determine whether a lake and streambed alteration agreement (LSAA) is required. If required under Section 1602, any compensatory mitigation shall be conducted in accordance with the terms of the LSAA, and in coordination with the other requirements of this mitigation measure (Mitigation Measure 3.16-2b) and Mitigation Measure 3.16-2c.  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable   ecological performance standards, based on the best available science and including specifications for native plant densities, species composition, amount of dead woody vegetation gaps and bare ground, and survivorship; at a minimum, compensatory mitigation planting sites must achieve 80 percent survival of planted vegetation by the end of the five-year maintenance and monitoring period or dead and dying plants shall be replaced and monitoring continued until 80 percent survivorship is achieved;  corrective measures if performance standards are not met;  responsible parties for monitoring and preparing reports; and  responsible parties for receiving and reviewing reports and for verifying success or prescribing implementation or corrective actions.  Impact 3.16-3: Tree removal Regardless of the magnitude of biological effects of tree removal, native trees are protected in the Tahoe Basin, because of their natural qualities and functions. Because Alternatives B, C, and D would result in removal of more than 100 trees 14 inches or greater dbh, they would result in substantial tree removal. With Alternative E, native tree removal would not be substantial. While all build alternatives would require removal of trees greater than 24 inches dbh in eastside forest and/or 30 inches dbh in westside forest, which is generally prohibited by TRPA, the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project meets the exception in TRPA Code Section 61.1.4.A.7 that allows for the removal of these trees for Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) projects,  Alt A = NI, Alt E = NA Mitigation Measure 3.16-3 has been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to biological effects resulting from tree removal.  Alt A = NI Alts B, C, D = PS Alt E = LTS  Mitigation Measure 3.16-3: Prepare tree removal, protection, and replanting plan The following mitigation applies to the transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites included in Alternatives B, C, and D for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. A Tree Removal, Protection, and Replanting Plan shall be prepared by the project proponent to provide tree protection measures to comply with the performance criteria and other requirements of Chapter 61 of the TRPA Code, prevent damage to trees that are proposed to remain, and determine appropriate tree replanting locations and approaches to occur in the project site.

A qualified forester will make a determination regarding the project’s consistency with Chapter 61 of the TRPA Code. The plan shall set forth prescriptions for tree removal, water quality protection, root zone and vegetation protection, residual stocking levels, replanting, slash disposal, fire protection, and other appropriate considerations.   Impact 3.16-4: Introduction and spread of invasive plants With three of the build alternatives (Alternatives B, C, and D), project implementation has the potential to introduce and spread terrestrial and aquatic invasive plants during construction and revegetation periods. Noxious weeds and other invasive plants could inadvertently be introduced or spread in the project site during grading and construction activities, if nearby source populations passively colonize disturbed ground, or if construction and personnel equipment is transported to the site from an infested area. Soil, vegetation, and other materials transported to the project site from off-site sources for BMPs, revegetation, or fill for project construction could contain invasive plant seeds or plant material that could become established in the project site. Additionally, invasive species currently present in or near the project site have the potential to be spread by construction disturbances. The introduction and spread of terrestrial or aquatic invasive species would degrade terrestrial plant, wildlife, and aquatic habitats, including habitats of special significance (riparian) within the project site opening up the potential introduction and spread of invasive species with Alternatives B, C, and D. With the no-build alternative (Alternative A) or Alternative E, no project-related ground disturbances in any common or sensitive vegetation community would occur; therefore, there would be no related  Alts A, E = NI Mitigation Measure 3.16-4 has been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the introduction and spread of invasive plants.  Alts A, E = NI Alts B, C, D = PS  Mitigation Measure 3.16-4: Implement invasive plant management practices during project construction This following mitigation applies to the transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites included in Alternatives B, C, and D for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. In consultation with TRPA, the project proponent shall implement appropriate invasive plant management practices during project construction. Recommended practices generally include the following:  Before construction activities begin, invasive plant infestations will be identified and appropriately treated where feasible. A qualified biologist will conduct a pre-construction survey for noxious weeds and other invasive plants in project construction areas, and determine the feasibility and appropriate method of removal/treatment. Treatments will be selected based on their effectiveness for each species ecology and phenology. All treatment methods—including the potential use of herbicides outside of potential wetland and SEZ areas—will be conducted in accordance with the law, regulations, and policies governing the land owner. Herbicides will not be used in sensitive habitats, including potential wetlands and SEZs.

In areas where treatment is not feasible, noxious weed areas will be clearly flagged or fenced to clearly delineate work exclusion.  To ensure that fill material and seeds imported to the project site are free of invasive plants/noxious weeds, the project will use on-site sources of fill and seeds whenever available. Fill and seed materials that need to be imported to the project site will be certified weed-free by the Resident Engineer. In addition, only certified weed-free imported materials (or rice straw in upland areas) will be used for erosion control.  Vehicles and equipment will arrive at the project site clean and weed-free. All equipment entering the project site from weed-infested areas or areas of unknown weed status will be cleaned of all attached soil or plant parts before being allowed into the project site. Vehicles and equipment will be cleaned using high-pressure water or air at designated weed-cleaning stations after exiting a weed-infested area. Cleaning stations will be designated by a botanist or noxious weed specialist and located away from aquatic resources. Equipment will be inspected by the on-site environmental monitor for mud or other signs that weed seeds or propagules could be present before use in the project site. If the equipment is not clean, the monitor will deny entry into work areas.  If designated weed-infested areas are unavoidable, the plants will be cut, if feasible, and disposed of in a landfill in sealed bags or disposed of or destroyed in another manner acceptable to TRPA or other agencies as appropriate. If cutting weeds is not  Adv = Adverse B = Beneficial LTS = Less than significant MU = mixed-use NA = Not applicable NAdv = Not adverse NI = No impact PS = Potentially significant S = Significant SU = Significant and unavoidable  feasible, layers of mulch, degradable geotextiles, or similar materials will be placed over the infestation area to minimize the spread of seeds and plant materials by equipment and vehicles during construction. These materials will be secured so they are not blown or washed away.  Locally collected native seed sources for revegetation shall be used when possible. Plant and seed material will be collected from or near the project site, from within the same watershed, and at a similar elevation when possible and with approval of the appropriate authority. Persistent nonnatives such as cultivated timothy (Phleum pretense), orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata), or ryegrass (Lolium spp.) shall not be used.  Mitigation Measure 3.16-2c: Compensate for Unavoidable Loss of SEZ The following mitigation applies to the transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites included in Alternatives B, C, and D for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. The following measures will be implemented to ensure consistency with Section 61.3 of the TRPA Code and further reduce potential adverse effects on SEZs, streams, and riparian habitat:  All reasonable alternatives shall be implemented to avoid or reduce the extent of encroachment into SEZs.   In instances where there is no feasible alternative to avoid an SEZ, the project proponent shall mitigate all impacts within the boundaries of SEZs by restoring SEZ habitat (land capability district 1b) in the surrounding area, or other appropriate area as determined by TRPA, at a minimum ratio of 1.5:1, consistent with TRPA Code.   The project proponent shall retain a qualified restoration ecologist to prepare a restoration plan that will address final clean-up, stabilization, and revegetation procedures for areas disturbed by the project. The restoration plan for SEZs shall include the following:  identification of compensatory mitigation sites and criteria for selecting these mitigation sites;  complete assessment of the existing biological resources in the restoration areas;  in kind reference habitats for comparison with compensatory SEZs (using performance and success criteria) to document success;  monitoring protocol, including schedule and annual report requirements (Compensatory habitat shall be monitored for a minimum of five years from completion of mitigation, or human intervention [including recontouring and grading], or until the success criteria identified in the approved mitigation plan have been met, whichever is longer);

Exhibit 1-1 provides a regional view of the project location. The project site consists of the outline of the transportation and related improvements and attendant landscape disturbance proposed for the alternatives under consideration. The study area for this environmental document, within which the project site is located (refer to Exhibit 2-1 in Chapter 2), is generally defined to include the length of existing US 50 from just west of the Pioneer Trail/US 50 intersection to the SR 207/US 50 intersection, Montreal Road, the full length of Lake Parkway on the mountain side, portions of the adjacent Van Sickle Bi-State Park and other privately-owned land on the mountain side of existing Lake Parkway, the portion of Lake Parkway that extends between existing US 50 and Stateline Avenue on the lake side, and the neighborhood just west of the Heavenly Village Center (Raley’s shopping center). 1.1 LEAD AGENCIES TTD, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) are preparing a joint environmental document for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project. The environmental document is an environmental impact report (EIR) for TTD pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.) and the State CEQA Guidelines (California Code of Regulations Section 15000 et seq.); an environmental impact statement (EIS) for TRPA pursuant to the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact (Public Law 96-551), 1980 revision (the Compact), Code of Ordinances, and Rules of Procedure; and an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the FHWA pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S. Code [USC] Section 4321-4347), the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations Implementing NEPA (40 Code of Federal Regulation [CFR] Section 1500-1508), and FHWA Environmental Impact and Related Procedures (23 CFR Section 771). All three agencies have determined that an EIR/EIS/EIS is needed to effectively analyze the project, evaluate the environmental impacts of the project and discuss alternatives to the project. TTD is also the project proponent.  1.2 PROJECT BACKGROUND The US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project, in various forms, has been a proposed transportation improvement for decades. It was first contemplated in the 1970s when construction of a “Loop Road” was required as mitigation for the approval of the expansion of three major casinos in Stateline, Nevada. The Nevada portion of a loop road was built, but the portion in California was never completed. The Lake Tahoe Compact also required the consideration of “completion of the Loop Road in the States of California and Nevada.” Table 1-1 summarizes the chronology of these and other historical planning efforts related to the project.      Exhibit 1-1 Regional Location of the Project   Table 1-1 Chronology of Events and Planning History  Timeframe  Document/Action Summary  Prepared by/ Prepared for  Description  1966  Highway Bypass Map   California Department of Transportation (Caltrans)  A full freeway cross-section is shown at this time for the proposed US 50, consisting of 4+ lanes with interchanges. Map shows alignment of highway through what is now Van Sickle Bi-State Park (south of Lake Parkway). The bypass was set back farther into the property than currently planned for the locally preferred action. Caltrans held right-of-way (ROW) at the time. ROW was relinquished, but this is now the alignment for the California Tahoe Conservancy’s Greenway Shared-Use Path.   Late 1970s  Loop Road required as mitigation for casino expansion  NA  As part of the approval of the expansion of three major casinos in the Stateline casino corridor, mitigation required the construction of a Loop Road to address traffic congestion in the US 50 corridor.   1975  Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan  Short Range Element (1975-1980)  Tahoe Regional Transportation Study Group (TRPA, CTRPA [California TRPA], Nevada Department of Transportation [NDOT], Caltrans)  Construction of an initial 2-lane Loop Road coupled with construction of a 2-lane bypass along the existing Caltrans “freeway” alignment and ROW (1966 Map). At the time, Lake Parkway did not exist and Montreal Road in California ended with a cul-de-sac in front of the current location of the Forest Suites Resort.  1979  Highway 50 Corridor Study in the South Lake Tahoe Area, Summary Report   Prepared for:  City of South Lake Tahoe Douglas County El Dorado County States of CA and NV Prepared by:  JHK & Associates  Planned the completion of the East Loop Road. The Lake Parkway improvements in place today on the Nevada side had been completed. Maps called for completion of the Loop Road and demonstrated that the Montreal Road extension in California had not yet been completed.   1980  Revised Tahoe Regional Planning Compact   TRPA  When the Compact was revised in 1980, Article V(2) required consideration of “completion of the Loop Road in the States of California and Nevada.”   1980 -1987  Basic Loop Road constructed  NA  Google Earth historical imagery demonstrates that the portion of the basic 2-lane Loop Road called for in earlier planning documents in the area of what is now Van Sickle Bi-State Park (i.e., the extension of Montreal Road) had been constructed. Lake Parkway footprint in this area is the same as today. The entire Loop Road had not yet been completed.   1987  South Lake Tahoe Redevelopment Design Plan (referred to as ROMA Redevelopment Plan in subsequent documents, after the design consultant)  Prepared for:  City of South Lake Tahoe Prepared by:  ROMA Design Group,  San Francisco  Plan included principal access to the casinos via the Loop Road and expansion of Montreal Road to 4 lanes, between Park Avenue and Glen Road. Called for the South Loop Road (Lake Parkway in front of what is now Van Sickle Bi-State Park) to be striped as a 4-lane facility with no central two-way left-turn lane.   1988  Regional Transportation Plan  Lake Tahoe Basin  TRPA  Operational improvements and highway alignment consistent with the 1987 ROMA Redevelopment Plan, including reducing the number of lanes on existing US 50 and expanding the number of lanes on the Loop Road to 4 lanes.  1989  South Tahoe Redevelopment Demonstration Plan for Ski Run/Stateline Areas  South Tahoe Redevelopment Agency  Planned for extension and reconfiguration of the South Loop Road to 5 lanes, 2 lanes in each direction with a center turn lane from Montreal Road east.   1990  South Lake Tahoe Loop Road Preliminary Roadway Design Report   City of South Lake Tahoe, Douglas County  Planned for extension and widening of existing South Loop Road to 5 lanes, 2 lanes in each direction with a center turn lane, and narrowing of existing US 50 to 3 lanes. Detailed preliminary design plans illustrated that encroachment into what is now Van Sickle Bi-State Park is similar to what is proposed with the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project.  1991  South Lake Tahoe Loop Road Project EIR/EIS   City of South Lake Tahoe, Douglas County  EIR/EIS considered effects of Loop Road project alternatives, but was never certified. Called for South Loop Road to be 5 lanes, 2 lanes in each direction with center turn lane, requiring expansion of the existing footprint.  Table 1-1 Chronology of Events and Planning History  Table 1-1 Chronology of Events and Planning History  Timeframe  Document/Action Summary  Prepared by/ Prepared for  Description  1991  Tahoe Transportation Summit Final Report   Prepared for: Tahoe Transportation Coalition Prepared by: LSC et al.  Planned for completion of the Loop Road System, including 5-lane cross-section for South Loop.  1993  Stateline Community Plan  (Element of Regional Plan for the Lake Tahoe Basin)  Douglas County, TRPA  Applied to Nevada side of casino corridor.

In 2008, the project was re-initiated by TRPA and a Project Development Team (PDT), consisting of the project proponent and affected agencies, was formed. In 2009, TTD assumed responsibility for the project, and the environmental review and public scoping process for the current project under consideration was initiated in 2011. The PDT acts as a technical steering committee with members representing the following federal, state, and local agencies, as well as other stakeholders and interested parties:   FHWA-California and Nevada,  California Department of Transportation (Caltrans),  California Tahoe Conservancy,   Nevada Department of Transportation,  Nevada Division of State Parks,   Nevada Division of Environmental Protection,   City of South Lake Tahoe,  Douglas County,   El Dorado County, and  South Tahoe Public Utility District. In addition to the PDT, a Community Review Committee (CRC) and a Business Review Committee (BRC) were formed in 2013 to provide a venue for community members and business owners to provide input into the alternative development and evaluation process. The current version of the project builds on the information developed in earlier planning processes, and the alternatives in this environmental document reflect input received from the public during outreach efforts, as well as from the PDT, CRC, BRC, and the City of South Lake Tahoe. The project is needed to address existing transportation deficiencies and projected transportation requirements along the US 50 corridor between Pioneer Trail and SR 207, to alleviate cut-through traffic in local neighborhoods in the City of South Lake Tahoe, and to support community revitalization goals in the California/Nevada state line area. The City of South Lake Tahoe and Douglas County, the communities within the US 50 corridor, have identified demand for transportation improvements to create well-designed, safer facilities that balance the needs of pedestrian, bicycle, transit, and private vehicle access while respecting the unique environmental setting of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Revitalization goals included creating more walkable, transit-served public space in the casino core through public and private investment, which would promote economic vitality.  To achieve these goals and the project’s basic objectives and purpose and need (see Section 1.3), TTD, TRPA, and FHWA are proposing to realign US 50 to circle around the south side of the casino core following the existing Lake Parkway alignment. The realignment of US 50, implements a concept contemplated in adopted planning documents dating back to the 1980s, as described in Table 1-1. Realignment of US 50 is identified as part of the Compact, Lake Tahoe Regional Plan, Tahoe Metropolitan Planning Organization (TMPO) Regional Transportation Plan, and TRPA Environmental Improvement Program.  The project is included in the TMPO 2015 Federal Transportation Improvement Program (FTIP) list and in the Draft 2017 FTIP. It is also considered to be a project implementable under fiscally constrained budget projections in the Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy (RTP/SCS), adopted in December 2012. “Fiscally constrained” means that the costs of the projects, over the 23-year plan horizon of the RTP, are within the reasonably foreseeable revenues of that period and, therefore, the project is prioritized for implementation. The RTP includes a baseline forecast of federal, state, and local funding, which is intended to reflect the level of funding that has historically been available from each of these sources, with inflation factors from zero to 2.5 percent depending on the revenue source (TMPO and TRPA 2012:6-5). The 2017 Regional Transportation Plan (2017 RTP), which is an update to the 2012 RTP, and its joint CEQA/TRPA environmental document have been circulated for public review. The vision and goals of the 2017 RTP were based on the 2012 RTP. The projects listed in the 2017 RTP are substantially similar to those in the 2012 RTP, and the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project is included in both documents. TTD has funding to complete the environmental review process and full design (preliminary through final) of the approved alternative. TTD also has some Right-of-Way – property acquisition and relocation – funds secured through State Transportation Block Grant (CA and NV) and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) grants. Funding for the remaining property acquisition, relocation, and project construction would come from a variety of federal, state, and local sources, including Federal Transportation Act funds incorporated into recently passed legislation, Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund from revenues of the Cap-and-Trade program administered by the California Air Resources Board, and newly adopted taxes from Douglas County, among others. A detailed cost estimate for the project is included in Attachment C and right of way costs are included in Attachment D of the Draft Project Report prepared for the project (Caltrans 2016).  The RTP/SCS was approved based on the environmental analysis in a CEQA EIR and TRPA EIS that was prepared as a program environmental document for the entire plan of transportation projects, including the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project. The RTP/SCS EIR/EIS is incorporated by reference into this document for the purpose of relying on cumulative and region-wide impact analysis that has already been prepared and presented in the certified RTP/SCS program EIR, in accordance with State CEQA Guidelines Section 15168, and in the certified TRPA EIS. TRPA and TMPO have prepared a joint CEQA Initial Study/TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist for the 2017 RTP as a supplement to the 2012 RTP/SCS EIS/EIR, and relies largely on that document’s analysis of potential environmental impacts and mitigation measures. Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15163, a supplement to an EIR need contain only the information necessary to make the previous EIR adequate for the project as revised. Refer to Section 3.19, “Cumulative Impacts,” for further explanation about the relationship between the analyses in this EIR/EIS/EIS and the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS.   The scope of the proposed transportation project elements (i.e., grading and retaining walls; roadway, bicycle, and pedestrian improvements; drainage and water quality infrastructure; and noise attenuation features) and the build alternatives considered in this environmental document are consistent with the project description in the 2012 RTP and the 2017 RTP. In 2015, TTD introduced a project element for the potential redevelopment of three existing sites within the project site as mitigation for land use displacement. The potential redevelopment would likely be implemented through a future public-private partnership between TTD and a private developer. It would provide an opportunity for new mixed-use, transit-oriented development to include replacement housing and commercial space that could be used by residents and businesses displaced by the transportation improvements with certain action alternatives. The preferred location for constructing replacement housing for displaced residents is at one of these mixed-use development sites. Note: this redevelopment aspect, which extends beyond the requirements of the Uniform Relocation Act (see Section 3.4, “Community Impacts”), is not FHWA’s action as part of the proposed project. 1.3 PURPOSE, NEED, AND OBJECTIVES NEPA requires disclosure of a project’s purpose and need. CEQA requires a description of the basic objectives of a project. TRPA does not have specific requirements for a project to identify the purpose, need, or objectives of the project. This section provides the information necessary to present the purpose and need and basic project objectives of the proposed US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project.  One of TTD’s operating principles is to develop value-added projects for the communities in which they work. In May 2016, consistent with TTD principles and in response to public feedback on the project, the TTD Board adopted guiding principles that formalize their commitment to providing replacement housing as part of the project, including deed-restricted affordable and moderate-income housing, for displaced residents. This commitment is reflected in the project objectives below. 1.3.1 Purpose The overall purposes of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project are described as follows:   Improve the corridor in a manner consistent with the Loop Road System concept;   Advance multi-modal transportation opportunities;   Improve vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle safety;   Improve the environmental quality of the area;   Reduce congestion;   Improve safety for residents, pedestrians, and bicyclists in local neighborhoods;  Implement regional and local plans, including the Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan;  Enhance visitor and community experience;   Promote the economic vitality of the area; and  Improve safety for residents, pedestrians, and bicyclists in local neighborhoods.  1.3.2 Need The purposes of the project would fulfill the following specific needs: A. Loop Road System concept. Article V(2) of the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact (Public Law 96-551), 1980 (Compact), requires a transportation plan for the integrated development of a regional system of transportation within the Tahoe Region. The Compact requires the transportation plan to include consideration of the completion of the Loop Road System in the States of California and Nevada. Improvements are required to the corridor to meet the intent of the Loop Road System concept. B. Multimodal mobility and safety. Ongoing and proposed resort redevelopment in the project area has increased pedestrian traffic, creating a need for improved pedestrian safety, mobility, and multi-modal transportation options. Improvements to pedestrian facilities, bicycle lanes, and transit are needed to connect the outlying residential and retail-commercial uses with employment and entertainment facilities, including hotels and gaming interests. Currently, there are no bicycle lanes on US 50 through the project area, and sidewalks are either not large enough to meet the increased demand, or do not exist. These issues adversely affect pedestrian and bicyclist safety and the visitor and community experience of the area. These needs could be addressed through development of a complete street—a street designed and operated to enable safe access for all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and transit riders of all ages and abilities—in the main tourist corridor of the Stateline area. Injury and fatality accident rates for pedestrians and vehicles through the project area are 14 percent above the statewide average rates for the latest three-year period of available data (Caltrans 2016, NDOT 2016). The roadways within the project site also have inadequate facilities for pedestrians, bicyclists, and vehicles. The inadequate facilitates detract from community character and quality of life of both residents and visitors. The poor transportation facilities and pedestrian/bicycle environment create constraints to the economic vitality of the study area (TTD 2013:3). There is a need for enhanced connectivity, transit use, walkability, and bicycle use in the study area to reduce dependence on private automobiles. C. Environmental quality in the area. Environmental improvements are needed in the area to help achieve TRPA’s adopted environmental threshold carrying capacities (thresholds), including for water quality and air quality. Paved roadways are the primary source of the fine sediment particles that are impairing the clarity of Lake Tahoe (Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board [RWQCB] and Nevada Department of Environmental Protection [NDEP] 2010). Improvements to stormwater runoff collection and treatment facilities are needed to meet TRPA, NDEP, and Lahontan RWQCB regulations and requirements for protecting the water quality and clarity of Lake Tahoe. As supported by analysis in the Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan and Sustainable Communities Strategy Final Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement, reduction of vehicle congestion and numbers of vehicles on the roadway through enhanced pedestrian and multi-modal opportunities and opportunities for compact, mixed-use development in the tourist core is needed to provide for a reduction in mobile-source greenhouse gas emissions (TMPO and TRPA 2012:3-57 – 3-61). Landscape improvements are needed to enhance the scenic quality of the project area, to facilitate compliance with TRPA’s scenic thresholds, and to enhance the community and tourism experience. Currently, the three TRPA roadway travel units in the project site (Roadway Travel Unit #32, Casino Core, a portion of Roadway Travel Unit #33, The Strip, and a small portion of Roadway Travel Unit #45, Pioneer Trail [North]) are not in attainment and are targeted for improvement in the Scenic Quality Improvement Plan and other adopted agency plans that apply to the area (TRPA in prep).  D. Minimize congestion. Study area intersections and roadway segments are currently operating at marginally acceptable levels during a typical summer PM peak hour (LOS D) (Wood Rodgers 2016:17); however, higher traffic during holidays, special events, and certain summer and winter peak periods results in long vehicle spillback to upstream intersections, long delays throughout the tourist core area, and undesirable traffic operations. The study area is projected to experience substantial increases in traffic congestion in the casino core in the future that would result in LOS E or worse conditions during normal summer peak hours. E. Neighborhood traffic operations. Neighborhood “cut-through” traffic occurs as drivers seek ways to avoid the congestion during peak periods in the summer and winter months and provides drivers with a faster travel route around the tourist core outside peak periods. Traffic volumes at the study area “gateways” have increased approximately 20 percent since 2011 while traffic within the casino core area has slightly decreased (Caltrans 2016, NDOT 2016, El Dorado County 2016), indicating that vehicles are using the neighborhood streets to bypass the core. The cut-through vehicles cause congestion in residential neighborhoods and have been observed to travel at high speeds, which endangers local residents and changes the character of the neighborhood. The project is needed to improve safety and operations of local roads through neighborhoods by providing roadway changes that reduce congestion and provide a more efficient travel route in the tourist core area for through traffic.  F. Regional and local plans. The project is needed to implement adopted regional and local plans for the area, including the Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan, the Lake Tahoe Environmental Improvement Program, the Tourist Core Area Plan, and the South Shore Area Plan. The transportation improvements and water quality improvements included in the project are identified in these plans.  G. Redevelopment and revitalization. Another project purpose is to create opportunities for redevelopment and revitalization of the study area. Currently, the study area is more conducive to vehicular travel than other modes, which presents limitations to walkability and bicycle use. Improvements to the existing US 50 through the tourist core to create a safer environment for pedestrian and bicycle travel are needed to make the study area more inviting for residents and visitors to patronize existing businesses. Additionally, a portion of the study area is located within the City of South Lake Tahoe Core Area Plan (TCAP). One of the guiding principles of the TCAP is to establish a diverse and concentrated mix of uses that create a strong, lively market (City of South Lake Tahoe 2013:4-1), which would help achieve the vision for revitalization of this area. 1.3.3 Project Objectives Recognizing the needs for and fundamental purposes of the project, it would be intended to achieve the following basic project objectives identified by TTD:   reduce overall vehicle delays through improved motor vehicle mobility on the state highway system, including for commercial access and a better resident and visitor experience;  decrease dependence on the use of private automobiles;  reduce the traffic volumes through the tourist corridor and “cut-through” traffic in adjacent neighborhoods, and develop a “complete street” for all users, including bicyclists, pedestrians, transit, and vehicles;   improve visual and environmental conditions within the corridor;   improve connectivity, reliability, travel times, and operations of public transportation modes, including increased mobility and safety for bicycles and pedestrians and enhanced public access to Van Sickle Bi-State Park;  make public transportation more effective with better visibility, connectivity, reliability, and travel times;   comply with TRPA regional level-of-service criteria;  facilitate the creation of a safe and walkable district that enhances pedestrian and bicyclist activities and safety and improves the City of South Lake Tahoe’s and Douglas County’s competitiveness with other regional and national tourist destinations;  create gateway and streetscape features that create a sense of place, align with complete streets principles, are reflective of Lake Tahoe’s natural setting, and provide effective way-finding;  provide opportunity for redevelopment and revitalization within the project site;  provide replacement housing for all residential units acquired for highway right-of-way purposes before groundbreaking for transportation improvements; and  result in no net loss of housing in the South Shore area. 1.4 LOGICAL TERMINI AND INDEPENDENT UTILITY FHWA regulations (23 CFR Part 771.111[f]) require that an action evaluated in a NEPA EIS meet three criteria addressing logical termini and independent utility. Logical termini are defined as rational end points for a transportation improvement and review of the environmental impacts. A project is considered to have independent utility when it can function, or operate, on its own without further construction of an adjoining segment. Projects must not preclude the opportunity to consider alternatives for a future, related transportation improvement. Project termini must be selected to prevent a highway improvement from forcing further improvements that may have adverse consequences not addressed in the applicable environmental studies.  The following discussion describes how the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project alternatives studied in this environmental document would meet the three criteria for defining logical termini and independent utility.  Criterion 1. Connect logical termini and be of sufficient length to address environmental matters on a broad scope. The project action alternatives (except Alternative E, Skywalk) involve realignment of US 50 along the mountain side of Lake Parkway and address erosion control and water quality through stormwater drainage improvements. The termini, inclusive of Alternatives B, C, and D, would be as follows (see Exhibit 2-1):  US 50 just west of its intersection with Pioneer Trail in California  US 50 to its intersection with SR 207 in Nevada  Stateline Avenue west of Azure Avenue  Montreal Road and Lake Parkway The termini for Alternative E would be US 50 just west of its intersection with Stateline Avenue in California and a point on US 50 west of the intersection with Lake Parkway.  The transportation needs discussed above are all located within these termini. These needs can be addressed without creating additional issues approaching or departing the study area. Thus, the project site encompasses a geographic area of sufficient size and scope for improvements.   Criterion 2. Have independent utility or independent significance (i.e., be usable and be a reasonable expenditure even if no additional transportation improvements in the area are made). As described in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation/Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities,” the project would provide substantial improvement over the no build condition by improving traffic operations, bicycle and pedestrian connectivity, transit features, and intermodal connectivity and by substantially reducing cut-through traffic with the new US 50 through the Rocky Point neighborhood. All state highway facilities would be designed to meet Caltrans and NDOT standards. Because the project involves the transportation improvements necessary to improve traffic conditions, it does not require other highway connections or improvements to enable it to perform properly. Also, the project would expand and enhance multi-modal access within the project site limits, so additional trail improvements would not be needed for adequate connectivity.   Criterion 3. Not restrict consideration of alternatives for other reasonably foreseeable transportation improvements. The analysis presented in this document considers the transportation system beyond the project site to ensure that none of the action alternatives would create the need for additional transportation improvements in the vicinity. As a result, the scope of the project includes end points that extend beyond the existing US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection and US 50/Lake Parkway intersection alone; further, because the proposed improvements are of sufficient length and scope, implementing the project or any of the action alternatives would not substantially increase congestion or reduce safety outside the defined study area. Therefore, the project alternatives would not force immediate transportation improvements on the remaining segments of the roadways outside the project site; and it would not constrain future improvement of any transportation facilities to which it connects. 1.5 SUMMARY OF PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT The environmental review process for the project began with issuance of a Notice of Preparation (NOP)/ Notice of Intent (NOI) to inform agencies and the public that a Draft EIR/EIS/EIS would be prepared for the project, and to solicit views of agencies and the public as to the scope and content of the document. The NOP was sent to the California and Nevada State Clearinghouses; federal, state, and local agencies; interested stakeholder groups; and members of the public who had requested notices about the project. The NOI was published in the Federal Register on November 1, 2011. An NOP/NOI informs the reviewer of the lead agencies’ intent to prepare an environmental document.  Two public scoping meetings were held to provide the opportunity to learn more about the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project and to receive comments from agencies, other interested parties, and the public regarding the issues that should be addressed in the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS.  The scoping meetings were held as follows:  November 10, 2011. TTD Board meeting, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 128 Market Street, Stateline, Nevada.  December 7, 2011. TRPA Advisory Planning Commission (APC) meeting, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 128 Market Street, Stateline, Nevada. The NOP/NOI was distributed on November 2, 2011, and the designated public scoping period extended for 44 calendar days, concluding on December 16, 2011.  Scoping comments received are summarized in Appendix A, “NOP/NOI and Scoping Summary Report.” In addition to the formal scoping process, TTD has engaged in numerous public outreach activities subsequent to the public scoping process, as identified in Table 1-2 below. Table 1-2 Summary of Public Outreach Activities That Occurred Subsequent to the Public Scoping Process  Year  PDT Meetings  City of South Lake Tahoe Council Presentations  Douglas County Board of County Commissioners Presentations  Community Meetings  Service Club Presentations  Community Review Committee Meetings  Business Review Committee Meetings  Community Events/ Stakeholder Meetings  One-on-One Meetings  Flyer Distribution  Press Releases/ Media Alerts  2011  3  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  2012  2  5  0  4  13  0  0  1  21  2  2  2013  1  1  0  2  1  4  5  1  20  1  5  2014  1  3  0  1  3  0  0  1  20  0  2  2015  1  1  1  1  0  0  0  3  20  0  3  2016  0  0  0  11  5  0  0  0  4  0  2  Totals  8  10  1  19  22  4  5  6  85  3  14  Source: Wasner, pers. comm., 2016a, 2016b; Robinson, pers. comm., 2016  1.6 NEXT STEPS IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS This Draft EIR/EIS/EIS has been released for public review and comment during a 60-day period (TRPA Rules of Procedure Section 6.13.2). After the public review and comment period ends, all comments on the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS will be evaluated and considered. Responses will be provided on substantive environmental points raised in public comments. In addition, any changes and refinements to the project that occur as a result of ongoing planning or comments received during the public review period will be described.  Following the close of the public comment period, a Final EIR/EIS/EIS that includes responses to all comments that raise environmental issues and selection of a preferred alternative will be prepared and circulated in accordance with CEQA, NEPA, and TRPA requirements. Following a 60-day circulation period for the Draft EIS and lead agency consideration of all comments received during public review of the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS and circulation of the Final EIR/EIS/EIS for 30 days, each of the lead agencies (TTD, TRPA, and FHWA) will follow their respective agency processes for decision making. Following completion of the responses to comments and preparation of the final environmental document, TTD, FHWA, and TRPA will select a preferred alternative and make the final determination of the project’s effect on the environment. Public meetings will be held by TTD and TRPA as part of the process of selecting the preferred alternative and considering project approval.  Under CEQA, the EIR certification process will include preparation of Findings of Fact for all significant impacts identified, adoption of a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program for mitigation incorporated into the project, and preparation of a Statement of Overriding Considerations for impacts that would not be mitigated below a level of significance (if applicable). The Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations will be considered before project approval. If the project is approved and the environmental document is certified, TTD will then file a Notice of Determination with the California and Nevada State Clearinghouses that will document the project’s approval.  Following completion of an EIS under NEPA, FHWA will prepare a record of decision (ROD) documenting its decision regarding the project. In preparing a ROD for the project under 40 CFR Section 1505.2, FHWA is required to “[s]tate whether all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm from the alternative selected have been adopted, and … [a] monitoring and enforcement program shall be adopted and summarized where applicable for any mitigation.” Under 23 USC 139(n)(2), the Final EIS and ROD are to be combined in one document and distributed at the same time to the maximum extent practicable. A combined Final EIS and ROD is not being prepared at this time because the draft EIS must first be circulated for public comment about the project. This is a complicated transportation improvements project that would displace a substantial number of residents and, for the purposes of NEPA, a preferred alternative cannot be identified until public comments on the draft EIS are considered. This document has been prepared in accordance with Article VII of the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact, Chapter 3 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances, and Article VI of the TRPA Rules of Procedure. Following the public and agency consultation period, substantive comments relating to the environmental analysis will be reviewed and responses will be prepared. The final environmental document will be presented to the TRPA Advisory Planning Commission, which will make a recommendation to the TRPA Governing Board with respect to certification of the proposed final document. The Governing Board will provide an opportunity for comment on the proposed final environmental document at a Governing Board hearing. The Governing Board will then consider taking action to certify the Final EIS and adopt findings (in accordance with TRPA Code Section 4.4) before considering approval of a project alternative. 1.7 OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT The US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project Draft EIR/EIS/EIS is available for public and agency review online at TTD’s website: www.tahoetransportation.org/us50 and TRPA’s website: www.trpa.org/get-involved/major-projects/.

The analysis includes a description of existing conditions and an analysis of changes to water quality and stormwater volumes or treatment systems. Regulations and guidelines established by the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) and local jurisdictions, along with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) statute and guidelines, provide the regulatory background that guides the assessment of potential environmental effects to these resources.  Scoping comments were submitted on the Notice of Preparation/Notice of Intent by the City of South Lake Tahoe requesting that the EIR/EIS/EIS should describe the proposed drainage system and associated stormwater treatment, discuss the potential impacts of constructing the systems, including impacts on existing drainage and stormwater improvements; and include detailed modeling (broken down by jurisdiction) of the project’s effects on Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) pollutants. The League to Save Lake Tahoe requested a commitment to effective and frequent road sweeping on both the loop road and the casino corridor road as mitigation for impacts of road sanding, as well as implementation of stormwater best management practices (BMPs). At the Advisory Planning Commission (APC) meeting in December 2011, Tom & Carolynn Petersen requested a discussion of the effect of the project on the City of South Lake Tahoe’s completed drainage projects in the area. Primary sources of information used in the preparation of this analysis are the Hydraulic and Floodplain Evaluation Report, U.S. Highway 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project (TTD 2015a) and Natural Environment Study, U.S. Highway 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project (TTD 2015b); Edgewood Lodge and Golf Course Improvement Project –Monitoring, Inspection, Maintenance and Operations Plan (Nichols Consulting Engineers 2011); Final Lake Tahoe Total Maximum Daily Load Report (Lahontan RWQCB and NDEP 2010); Storm Water Quality Handbooks: Construction Site BMPs Manual (Caltrans 2003); Nevada Contractors Field Guide for Construction Site Best Management Practices (NDEP 2008); and TRPA BMP Handbook (TRPA 2014). Potential environmental effects related to 100-year flood hazards are addressed in Section 3.9, “Floodplains.” Impacts on Stream Environment Zones (SEZs) are discussed in Section 3.11, “Geology, Soils, Land Capability, and Coverage,” and in Section 3.16, “Biological Environment.”  3.10.1 Regulatory Setting FEDERAL Federal Antidegradation Policy The Federal Antidegradation Policy was enacted to provide protection to high-quality water resources of national importance. It directs states to develop and adopt statewide antidegradation policies that include protecting existing instream water uses and maintaining a level of water quality necessary to protect those existing uses and the water quality of high-quality waters. In the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) Clean Water Act regulations regarding water quality standards (40 CFR Chapter 1, Section 131.12[a][3]), the criteria for requiring an antidegradation standard includes: “where high quality waters constitute an outstanding National resource, such as waters of National and State parks and wildlife refuges and waters of exceptional recreational or ecological significance, that water quality shall be maintained and protected.” EPA has designated Lake Tahoe an Outstanding National Resource Water (ONRW). ONRWs are provided the highest level of protection under EPA’s Antidegradation Policy, stipulating that states may allow some limited activities that result in temporary and short-term changes to water quality, but such changes should not adversely affect existing uses or degrade the essential character or special uses for which the water was designated an ONRW. EPA interprets this provision as a prohibition to prohibit new or increased discharges to ONRWs that would degrade water quality. Clean Water Act (Public Law 92-500) Section 404 The Clean Water Act (CWA) consists of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 and subsequent amendments. The CWA provides for the restoration and maintenance of the physical, chemical, and biological integrity of the nation’s waters. Section 404 of the act prohibits the discharge of fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands, except as permitted under separate regulations by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and EPA. To discharge dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands, Section 404 requires projects to receive authorization from the Secretary of the Army, acting through the USACE. Waters of the United States are generally defined as “…waters which are currently used, or were used in the past, or may be susceptible to use in interstate or foreign commerce, including all waters which are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide; territorial seas and tributaries to such waters.” Section 401 Under CWA Section 401, applicants for a federal license or permit to conduct activities that may result in the discharge of a pollutant into waters of the United States must obtain certification for the discharge. The certification must be obtained from the state in which the discharge would originate or, if appropriate, from the interstate water pollution control agency with jurisdiction over the affected waters at the point where the discharge would originate. Therefore, all projects that have a federal component and may affect state water quality (including projects that require federal agency approval, such as issuance of a Section 404 permit) must also comply with CWA Section 401. Water quality certification requires evaluation of potential impacts in light of water quality standards and CWA Section 404 criteria governing discharge of dredged and fill materials into waters of the United States. The federal government delegates water pollution control authority under CWA Section 401 to the states. In California, CWA administration is provided by the Regional Water Quality Control Boards (RWQCBs) in California and the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) in Nevada. Section 402 Section 402 of the CWA establishes the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program to regulate discharges of pollutants into waters of the United States. An NPDES permit sets specific discharge limits for point sources discharging pollutants into waters of the United States and establishes monitoring and reporting requirements, as well as special conditions. Two types of nonpoint source discharges are controlled by the NPDES program: discharges caused by general construction activities and the general quality of stormwater in municipal stormwater systems. The goal of the NPDES nonpoint-source regulations is to improve the quality of stormwater discharged to receiving waters to the maximum extent practicable. The RWQCBs in California and NDEP in Nevada are responsible for implementing the NPDES permit system (see the discussion of state regulations below). Section 303 Section 303(d) of the CWA requires states to develop lists of water bodies that do not attain water quality objectives after implementation of required levels of treatment by point source dischargers (municipalities and industries). Section 303(d) requires that the state develop a total maximum daily load (TMDL) for each of the listed pollutants. The TMDL is the amount of the pollutant that the water body can receive and still be in compliance with water quality objectives. The TMDL is also a plan to reduce loading of a specific pollutant from various sources to achieve compliance with water quality objectives. EPA must either approve a TMDL prepared by the state or disapprove the state’s TMDL and issue its own. NPDES permit limits for listed pollutants must be consistent with the waste load allocation prescribed in the TMDL. After implementation of the TMDL, it is anticipated that the problems that led to listing of a given pollutant on the Section 303(d) list would be remediated. The Lake Tahoe TMDL is administered at the state level by Lahontan RWQCB and the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection and is discussed below.  TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY Lake Tahoe Regional Plan Regional Plan priorities and policies include accelerating water quality restoration by targeting environmental redevelopment and Environmental Improvement Program opportunities, retaining the current regional growth system that prevents unchecked overdevelopment and encourages preservation of open space, and integrating with the Regional Transportation Plan to address congestion and support pedestrian and bike improvement projects that reduce vehicle dependency.  Goals and Policies TRPA has established a number of goals and policies related to water quality. Goals include supporting the Lake Tahoe TMDL through the reduction of sediment and nutrients to Lake Tahoe and the elimination or reduction of other pollutants; comprehensive water quality planning and coordination with public agencies and the private sector; and maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of water quality programs. Policies address a range of issues including snow removal, wastewater spill prevention, underground storage tanks, dredging, and reduction of impacts from motorized watercraft.  Code of Ordinances The TRPA Code contains the requirements and standards intended to achieve water quality thresholds, goals, and policies. Chapter 60 of the TRPA Code is directed specifically at water quality, but a number of other chapters and sections contain provisions related to design and installation of best management practices (BMPs) and standards for grading and excavation (Table 3.10-1).  Table 3.10-1 Water Quality Code Requirements Related to the Action Alternatives  Ordinance  Requirement  Section 60.4  Runoff shall be controlled with implementation of BMPs.  Chapter 35  Regulations pertaining to recognition of natural hazards, including floodplains, prevention of damage to property, and protection of public health relating to such natural hazards. The TRPA Code prohibits development, grading or filling of lands within 100-year floodplains with certain exceptions, including specific public outdoor recreation facilities, public health or safety facilities, access to buildable sites across a floodplain, and erosion control projects or water quality control facilities when it can be proven there are no viable alternatives and all potential impacts can be minimized (TRPA 2012a).  Section 33.4  Requirements for special investigations, reports, and plans, determined to be necessary by TRPA to protect the environment against significant adverse effects from grading projects.  Section 33.5  Requirements for grading and construction schedules when grading or construction is to occur pursuant to a TRPA permit.  Chapter 33.3  Standards for grading and excavation. Grading is permitted only between May 1 and October 15.  Section 60.1  Discharge standards for runoff and discharge to surface and groundwater.  Section 60.2  For projects that result in increased impervious coverage, implementation of off-site water quality control or stream environment zone mitigation projects is required; or payments into the Water Quality Mitigation Fund.  Source: TRPA 2012a   Numerical discharge standard limitations are specified in the TRPA Code for nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, turbidity, suspended sediments, and grease and oil. Pollutant concentrations in surface runoff may not exceed the concentrations listed in Table 3.10-2 at the 90th percentile for discharge to surface waters. Surface runoff infiltrated into soils may not exceed the concentrations listed in Table 3.10-2 for discharge to groundwater. In addition to numerical discharge limits, TRPA Code also restricts the discharge of wastewater and toxic substances, sets requirements for snow removal, sets requirements for salt and abrasive use, and sets criteria for pesticide use and fertilizer control. Table 3.10-2 TRPA Discharge Limits for Surface Runoff and Discharge to Groundwater  Constituent  Maximum Concentration  Surface Runoff    Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen as N  0.5 mg/l  Dissolved Phosphorus as P  0.1 mg/l  Dissolved Iron as Fe  0.5 mg/l  Grease and Oil  2.0 mg/l  Suspended Sediment  250 mg/l  Discharge to Groundwater    Total Nitrogen as N  5 mg/l  Total Phosphate as P  1 mg/l  Iron as FE  4 mg/l  Turbidity  200 NTU1  Grease and Oil  40 mg/l  Source: TRPA 2012a 1 NTU = Nephelomteric Turbidity Unit  Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities Water quality standards adopted by TRPA set a target to return the lake to the transparency observed in the late 1960s. Six major indicator themes are currently used by TRPA to assess the water quality of Lake Tahoe and its tributaries. Table 3.10-3, TRPA Summary of Findings by Threshold Category (Water Quality), lists each threshold category, indicator reporting category (indicator theme), and generalized characterization of current status, trend, and confidence (TRPA 2016). Table 3.10-3 TRPA Summary of Findings by Threshold Category (Water Quality)  Threshold Category  Indicator Reporting Category (Indicator Theme)  Generalized Characterization of Current Status and Trend1  Water Quality  Pelagic Lake Tahoe(open waters of Lake Tahoe)  Indicators range from somewhat worse than target to somewhat better than target, trending toward little or no change1. The exception to this is the indicator for Phytoplankton Primary Productivity, which is described as considerably worse than target with a trend toward rapid decline.  Water Quality  Littoral Lake Tahoe (nearshore waters of Lake Tahoe)  Indicators are at or somewhat better than target with insufficient data to determine trend. There is insufficient data to determine the status or trend for Attached Algae or Aquatic Invasive Species.  Water Quality  Tributaries  Suspended sediment concentrations in tributaries are considerably better than target however Phosphorus and Nitrogen concentrations are still worse than target for most tributary streams. There is insufficient data to determine the status of sediment and nutrient loading in tributaries, however these indicators are trending toward no change or moderate improvement.  Water Quality  Surface Runoff (stormwater runoff to surface waters)  There is insufficient data to determine status or trend of Surface Runoff indicators.   Water Quality  Groundwater (stormwater runoff to soil)  There is insufficient data to determine status or trend of Groundwater indicators.   Water Quality  Other Lakes (Fallen Leaf Lake)  There is insufficient data to determine status or trend of indicators for Other Lakes.   1 Range of Qualifiers from best to worst: Possible Status Categories: Considerably better than, at or somewhat better than, somewhat worse than, considerably worse than, and insufficient data to determine status or no target established. Possible Trend Categories: Rapid movement, moderate improvement, little or no change, moderate decline, rapid decline, and insufficient data to determine trend. Source: TRPA 2016  Nearshore Water Quality The quality of water in the nearshore area, the primary point of contact for most residents and visitors to the lake, is tracked by measuring turbidity, which is an indication of the cloudiness of water expressed in Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). Higher turbidity measurements indicate cloudier water. TRPA maintains standards for nearshore turbidity, <3NTU in areas influenced by stream discharge, and <1NTU in areas not influenced by stream discharge. Nearshore turbidity monitoring completed between November 2014 and November 2015 did not result in a single value that exceeded the <1NTU standard (TRPA 2016). Deep Water (Pelagic) Transparency and Clarity Long-term changes to the transparency and clarity of Lake Tahoe are influenced by the amount of particulate material in the water, which includes inorganic particles that scatter light (e.g., fine sediment suspended in the water column) and organic particles that absorb light (e.g., suspended algae). Tahoe’s transparency is currently 25 feet worse than 1968 values, based on average annual Secchi disk measurement (TERC 2016). In 2015, the average annual Secchi disk visibility depth measured from the surface of the lake was 73.1 feet, which is a decrease in clarity of 4.8 feet from the previous year, but still 9 feet greater than the lowest value recorded, which was an average annual measurement of 64.1 feet in 1997 (TERC 2016). These measurements confirm the long-term halt in clarity degradation; however, year-to-year fluctuations are expected (TERC 2015).  Deep Water Primary Productivity Primary productivity measures the rate at which algae grow. Measurements of primary productivity are expressed as grams of carbon per square meter (gC/m2). The phytoplankton primary productivity indicator is used to determine compliance with TRPA’s Lake Tahoe phytoplankton productivity standard of 52 gC/m2/yr, which is based on data collected over 4 years (1968-1971). Phytoplankton primary productivity has remained well above the standard since it was established in 1982 (TRPA 2016).  Other Thresholds In addition to water quality thresholds and standards that specifically measure the water quality of Lake Tahoe, additional thresholds are used by TRPA to assess the quality of water in tributary streams to Lake Tahoe or other waters directly discharged to Lake Tahoe. These thresholds include standards that define: maximum allowable pollutant concentrations for various constituents in tributaries to Lake Tahoe; surface runoff concentrations discharged to surface waters; surface runoff concentrations discharged to land surfaces for infiltration; stormwater runoff to soil (affecting groundwater); and the quality of other lakes in the Tahoe Region. Table 3.10-3, above, provides the current status for these additional Water Quality Indicator Reporting Categories. Tourist Core Area Plan The City of South Lake Tahoe, in conjunction with and approval from TRPA, adopted the Tourist Core Area Plan (TCAP) on October 15, 2013, which replaced the Stateline/Ski Run Community Plan of 1994. The tourist core stretches approximately 2 miles along US 50 extending from Fairway Drive to the California and Nevada State Line and along Ski Run Boulevard from Lake Tahoe to Pioneer Trail. This area functions as the primary visitor and tourist district in the City of South Lake Tahoe and provides direct access to recreation opportunities such as Heavenly Ski Resort, Edgewood Golf Course, Ski Run Marina, Lakeside Marina, and Van Sickle Bi-State Park. TCAP policies applicable to the action alternatives are discussed below.  Natural and Cultural Resources TCAP goals and policies applicable to water quality and stormwater management are found in the Natural and Cultural Resources section. Water quality policies include a requirement for installation of BMPs on all projects identified in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TRPA and the City of South Lake Tahoe (Policy NCR-3.1); continued collaboration with Lahontan to update and refine pollutant load reduction targets beyond 2016 and to update the Pollutant Load Reduction Plan as necessary to achieve the Lake Tahoe TMDL targets (Policy NCR-3.4); and continued collaboration with Caltrans to implement water quality improvement projects along US 50 (NCR-3.5). The full text of these policies and the overarching goal of protecting and enhancing the clarity of Lake Tahoe and water quality in other water bodies (Goal NCR-3), along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with these policies and goal, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.” South Shore Area Plan Douglas County, in conjunction with and with approval from TRPA, prepared and approved the South Shore Area Plan (SSAP) on November 21, 2013. The SSAP replaced the Stateline Community Plan, Kingsbury Community Plan, and a portion of Plan Area Statements 070A (Edgewood), including Special Area #1 (C-070A SA1), and a portion of Plan Area Statement 080 (Kingsbury Drainage), including Special Area #2 (R-080 SA2). The SSAP was designed to be consistent with the goals and policies in the 2012 Regional Plan. The SSAP includes four separate components that are integrated into Douglas County planning documents, including the Douglas County Master Plan, Zoning Map, Development Code, and Design Criteria and Improvement Standards.  STATE California Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board The Porter-Cologne Act created the California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) and nine RWQCBs in California. The SWRCB protects water quality by setting statewide policy, coordinating and supporting RWQCB efforts, and reviewing petitions that contest RWQCB actions. The RWQCBs issue waste discharge permits, take enforcement action against violators, and jointly administer federal and state laws related to water quality in coordination with EPA and USACE. The Tahoe Region is located within the jurisdiction of the Lahontan RWQCB. The Lahontan RWQCB Region is approximately 570 miles long, covering an area of 33,131 square miles, from the California-Oregon border to the Antelope Valley watershed in Los Angeles and San Bernardino Counties. In addition to the Tahoe Region, the Lahontan Region includes Death Valley, Mount Whitney, Owens Valley, Mono Lake, and portions of Lassen and Modoc Counties. On the California side of the Tahoe Region, Lahontan RWQCB implements the CWA, the California Water Code (including the Porter-Cologne Act), and a variety of laws related to control of solid waste and toxic and hazardous wastes. Lahontan RWQCB has authority to set and revise water quality standards and discharge prohibitions. It issues federal permits, including NPDES permits and Section 401 water quality certifications, and state waste discharge requirements or waivers of waste discharge requirements. Its planning and permitting actions require compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Water Quality Control Plan for the Lahontan Basin Water quality standards and control measures for surface and ground waters of the Lahontan Region are contained in the Water Quality Control Plan for the Lahontan Region (Basin Plan). The Basin Plan designates beneficial uses for water bodies. It establishes water quality objectives, waste discharge prohibitions, and other implementation measures to protect those beneficial uses. Chapter 5 of the Basin Plan, Water Quality Standards and Control Measures for the Lake Tahoe Basin, summarizes a variety of control measures for the protection and enhancement of Lake Tahoe. The Basin Plan was first adopted in 1975, and most recently updated in 2014. The Basin Plan contains both narrative and numeric water quality objectives for the region. The 2014 Basin Plan amendments include additional language related to: “mixing zones” for dilution of discharged water; compliance schedules for NPDES permits; discharge prohibition exemptions for low treat discharges such as incidental runoff from landscape irrigation or construction dewatering; simplification of existing prohibition exemptions; and the removal of language describing programs administered by TRPA (Lahontan RWQCB 2014). Waste Discharge Prohibition for the Lake Tahoe Hydrologic Unit The Basin Plan prohibits the discharge of any waste or deleterious material to the surface waters of Lake Tahoe, the 100-year floodplain of any tributary to Lake Tahoe, or any SEZ within the Lake Tahoe hydrologic unit. The Board may grant an exception for public service facilities provided that the following findings can be made:   the project is necessary for public health, safety, or environmental protection;   there is no reasonable alternative, including spans that avoids or reduces the extent of encroachment;   the impacts are fully mitigated;   SEZ lands are restored in an amount of 1.5 times the area of SEZ developed or disturbed by the project; and  wetlands are restored in an amount at least 1.5 times the area of wetland disturbed or developed. Certain wetlands may require restoration of greater than 1.5 times the area developed or disturbed. General Permit for Stormwater Discharges Associated with Construction Activity in the Lake Tahoe Basin The Lahontan RWQCB adopted the NPDES Construction Stormwater Permit for the Lake Tahoe Basin in April 2011. Projects disturbing more than 1 acre of land during construction must file a Notice of Intent with the Lahontan RWQCB to be covered under this permit. Construction activities subject to the Lake Tahoe Construction Stormwater Permit include clearing, grading, stockpiling, and excavation. Dischargers are required to eliminate or reduce non-stormwater discharges to storm sewer systems and other waters. A storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) must be developed and implemented for each site covered by the permit. The SWPPP must include BMPs designed to prevent construction pollutants from contacting stormwater and keep products of erosion from moving off-site into receiving waters throughout the construction and life of the project; the BMPs must address source control and, if necessary, pollutant control. Under this General Permit any stormwater generated from the construction site must meet the effluent limits shown in Table 3.10-4, Lake Tahoe Stormwater Effluent Limits. Table 3.10-4 Lake Tahoe Stormwater Effluent Limits  Parameter  Units  Maximum Daily Effluent Limitations for Discharge  Total Nitrogen (as N)  Mg/L  0.5  Total Phosphorus (as P)  Mg/L  0.1  Total Iron   Mg/L  0.5  Turbidity  NTU  20*  Grease and Oil  Mg/L  2  *Note: For Active Treatment Systems use 10 NTU as daily average and 20 NTU for any single sample Source: Lahontan RWQCB 2011c  Statewide Stormwater Permit for the State of California Department of Transportation  Section 402(p) of the CWA requires storm water permits for discharges from municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s). The EPA defines an MS4 as a conveyance or system of conveyances (including roads with drainage systems, municipal streets, catch basins, curbs, gutter, ditches, man-made channels, or storm drains) owned or operated by a State (40 CFR 122.26(b)(8)). The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) is responsible for the design, construction, and maintenance of the State highway system and related properties, including the Caltrans MS4 facilities that receive stormwater runoff from the State owned right-of-way. Initially, all Caltrans MS4 discharges were issued individual NPDES permits. In 1999, the SWRCB issued a statewide permit that regulated all discharges from Caltrans MS4s. This statewide permit was renewed in 2013. The Caltrans Statewide Stormwater Permit is implemented through the Statewide Stormwater Management Plan (SWMP) that describes the procedures and practices used to reduce or eliminate the discharge of pollutants to storm drainage systems and receiving waters.  The Caltrans Statewide Stormwater Permit (in compliance with Section 402 of the CWA) requires the use of stormwater BMPs to control and abate the discharge of pollutants to the Maximum Extent Practicable (MEP). Monitoring of effluent and receiving waters is required to determine the effectiveness of BMPs. If stormwater discharges are found to be causing or contributing to an exceedance of an applicable Water Quality Standard, Caltrans is required to revise its BMPs. Additionally, the MEP standard does not apply to TMDL-based requirements. Caltrans must implement all controls necessary to meet the Waste Load Allocations assigned to it through an adopted TMDL.  El Dorado County and City of South Lake Tahoe Municipal NPDES Permit.  Portions of El Dorado County and Placer County and the entire jurisdiction of the City of South Lake Tahoe lie with the Lake Tahoe Hydrologic Unit. Because Lake Tahoe is an Outstanding National Resource Water and is negatively affected by urban runoff from these municipalities, the Lahontan RWQCB adopted a Phase 1 NPDES program to regulate these MS4s in 1992. The NPDES (CAG616001) is generally updated every five years with the most recent update occurring in 2011. The current permit (Order No. R6T-2011-0101) includes: numeric effluent limits for fine sediment, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus; requirements for comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans; Pollutant Load Reduction Plans (as required by the Lake Tahoe TMDL); assessment of load reduction requirements using the Lake Tahoe Clarity Crediting Program Handbook; and effectiveness monitoring.  Nevada Nevada Division of Environmental Protection The Bureau of Water Quality Planning (BWQP) is part of the NDEP and is responsible for several water quality protection functions in the state. These include collecting and analyzing water data, developing standards for surface waters, publishing informational reports, providing water quality education, and implementing programs to address surface water quality. The BWQP is divided into four branches: water quality standards, monitoring, nonpoint source pollution management, and the Lake Tahoe management program. The branches are responsible for the following duties and responsibilities:  The Water Quality Standards Branch is responsible for developing and reviewing water quality standards; determining total maximum daily loads and wasteload allocations from point sources; and determining load allocations from non-point sources.  The Monitoring Branch is responsible for administering the state’s water quality monitoring program. This branch maintains and updates water quality data for the national water quality database (Water Quality Exchange Network - WQX) and is responsible for preparation of Nevada’s Water Quality Assessment Report, which is required under Section 305(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA).  The Nonpoint Source (NPS) Pollution Management Program aims to control nonpoint sources of pollution in Nevada. NPS pollution results from a variety of diffuse and dispersed human activities.  The Lake Tahoe Watershed Program unit collaborates with Lahontan RWQCB to develop the Total Maximum Daily Load for Lake Tahoe. Nevada relies on EPA criteria when establishing numeric water quality standards for toxics. Water quality standards are contained in the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC), chapter 445A.119 – 445A.225. Lake Tahoe water quality standards for Nevada are prescribed in 445A.191. Similar to the California requirements under the Lahontan RWQCB, the NDEP stipulates that a Stormwater General Permit must be obtained, which includes the development of a SWPPP. SWPPPs must demonstrate adequate BMP selection and installation for any construction project that is to disturb one or more acres. When the receiving waters of the discharge are Section 303(d) Impaired Water Bodies with an established TMDL, such as in the case of the Lake Tahoe Region, the project must comply with all applicable TMDL requirements. Lake Tahoe TMDL The Lake Tahoe TMDL was developed as a partnership between Lahontan RWQCB and the NDEP and approved by the EPA in 2011. The TMDL addresses the declining clarity and transparency of Lake Tahoe. Each TMDL represents a goal that may be implemented by adjusting pollutant discharge requirements in individual NPDES permits or establishing nonpoint source controls. Because California and Nevada must comply with, administer, and enforce their own state laws and policies, each state has developed its own Lake Tahoe TMDL to address the impairment of Lake Tahoe as addressed in each state’s Section 303(d) filings with EPA. The following items highlight the differences in implementation approaches between the two states:  California’s Lake Tahoe TMDL (dated November 2010 and approved by EPA in 2011) requires attainment of the California transparency objective for Lake Tahoe over a 65-year implementation period. Based on California law, Lahontan RWQCB has the obligation to implement and enforce the California Lake Tahoe TMDL through NPDES discharge permits (over which EPA has jurisdiction) issued to California government entities (City of South Lake Tahoe, Placer County, El Dorado County, and the California Department of Transportation).   Nevada’s Lake Tahoe TMDL (dated August 2011 and approved by EPA in 2011) is a modified version of the California Lake Tahoe TMDL. The Nevada Lake Tahoe TMDL clarifies Nevada’s regulatory structure and approach to implementation and emphasizes that the proposed implementation timelines may need to be adjusted for a variety of reasons, but particularly based on the availability of future funding. NDEP’s stated plan for implementing the Lake Tahoe TMDL for Washoe County and Douglas County is through Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with each jurisdiction. MOAs are a collaborative, legally non-binding approach to implementing a TMDL. NDEP regulates the Nevada Department of Transportation NPDES discharge permit. LOCAL City of South Lake Tahoe Municipal Code As a provision of the NPDES permit, the City of South Lake Tahoe in partnership with Placer County and El Dorado County developed a Storm Water Management Plan that describes the process and procedures the City will take to move towards greater compliance with the TRPA and Lahontan RWQCB’s water quality requirements. The City of South Lake Tahoe developed a 2008 Drainage Master Plan that identifies specific drainage improvement and stormwater quality facilities. Section 8-6 of the City Code describes requirements for the preparation and submittal of grading plans and standards to ensure the proposed construction does not damage adjoining properties or streets due to increases in flow or flooding. The City of South Lake Tahoe adopted the 2030 General Plan on May 17, 2011. The 2030 General Plan is the City’s policy document containing elements that guide land use, transportation, public facilities and services, recreation, natural resources, and other decisions in compliance with the Regional Plan. General Plan Policies applicable to the action alternatives are discussed below. Douglas County Code Douglas County provides drainage design requirements and guidance through Douglas County Code Section 20.100 and the Storm Drainage section of its Design Criteria and Improvements Standards Manual (Douglas County 2008). This manual does not allow for any increase in the peak rate of flow from development, and emphasis is given to the use of detention facilities sized to minimize runoff to pre-developed levels. Retention and infiltration facilities are permitted for projects in the Tahoe Basin with approval by TRPA (Douglas County 2008). 3.10.2 Affected Environment SURFACE WATER QUALITY Edgewood Creek and Golf Course Creek flow through the study area. Golf Course Creek joins with Edgewood Creek for approximately 1,200 feet before entering Lake Tahoe.  Lake Tahoe Lake Tahoe is classified by limnologists as an oligotrophic lake, which means the lake has very low concentrations of nutrients that can support algal growth, leading to clear water and high levels of dissolved oxygen (TERC 2011: p. 6.15). The exceptional transparency of Lake Tahoe results from naturally low inputs of nutrients and sediment from the surrounding watersheds. The most recent scientific research points to inorganic fine sediment particles (particles defined as less than 16 micrometers in diameter) as the primary pollutant of concern impairing Lake Tahoe’s transparency. This finding is based on the ability of inorganic fine sediment particles to efficiently scatter light and decrease observed transparency. Swift et al. (2006) determined that light scattering by inorganic particles for the period between 1999 and 2002 was responsible for approximately 55 to 60 percent of measured light attenuation in the lake. Additional pollutants of concern include phosphorus and nitrogen, which stimulate algal growth in the lake contributing to declines in transparency and the quality of the near-shore environment.  Research during the development of the Lake Tahoe TMDL included an analysis of pollutant sources to identify the magnitude of pollutant loads to Lake Tahoe from specific source categories. These categories were defined as: surface runoff from developed lands (urban watershed); atmospheric deposition; forested runoff (non-urban watershed); stream channel erosion; groundwater; and shoreline erosion. Exhibit 3.10-1 displays the relative distribution of average annual pollutant loading to Lake Tahoe for each pollutant of concern among the source categories (Lahontan RWQCB and NDEP 2010). As shown in Exhibit 3.10-1, the Lake Tahoe TMDL identifies surface runoff from developed lands as the most significant source of pollutant loading for fine sediment particles and phosphorus. For example, developed lands are estimated to deliver over 70 percent of the average annual fine sediment particle load and approximately 40 percent of the average annual phosphorus load to the lake. For nitrogen, atmospheric deposition is identified as the most significant source of loading to the lake, contributing 55 percent of the average annual load. The Lake Tahoe TMDL established the goal of restoring Lake Tahoe’s historic deep water transparency to 29.7 meters (97.4 feet) annual average Secchi depth (Lahontan RWQCB and NDEP 2010). The deep-water transparency water quality objective for Lake Tahoe has not been met since its adoption. To achieve the transparency standard, estimated fine sediment particle, phosphorus, and nitrogen loads must be reduced by 65 percent, 35 percent, and 10 percent, respectively. It is anticipated that attainment of these load reduction standards will take 65 years from implementation (Lahontan RWQCB and NDEP 2010). A 20-year interim transparency goal, known as the Clarity Challenge requires basin wide pollutant load reductions to be achieved within 15 years, followed by five years of monitoring to confirm that 24 meters of Secchi depth transparency has been reached. To attain the goals of the Clarity Challenge, implementation efforts must reduce basin-wide fine sediment particle, phosphorus, and nitrogen loads by 32 percent, 14 percent, and 4 percent, respectively.  New Picture (2)New Picture (1)New PictureSource: Adapted from Lahontan RWQCB and NDEP 2010 Exhibit 3.10-1 Lake Tahoe TMDL Pollutant Sources Edgewood Creek The Edgewood Creek Watershed lies predominantly within Douglas County, Nevada, with a small upper portion within California. The watershed drains an area of about 6.6 square miles where it feeds into Lake Tahoe. The land within the watershed has a variety of uses including the Stateline Casino area, Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course, Heavenly Ski Resort, state and interstate highways, local roads, utility right-of-way corridors, residential neighborhoods, and public lands (state and federal).  Edgewood Creek is a perennial stream that is located at the north end of the study area and flows east to west under US 50, ultimately discharging into Lake Tahoe. Edgewood Creek supports a relatively well-developed riparian canopy upstream of US 50; however, downstream of US 50 the creek flows through a golf course and, as a result, has been substantially modified. Water quality in Edgewood Creek is impacted by increased runoff volumes associated with increased impervious cover; changes to morphology; alteration of riparian vegetation; in-stream ponds and sediment basins; the frequency and extent of maintenance activities; addition of dissolved iron of natural origin; and the discharge of potentially untreated stormwater from roadways. Use of the Creek and the riparian zone for snow storage also affects water quality since the snow contains significant volumes of de-icing abrasives.  The upper reaches of Edgewood Creek (from the source to Palisades Drive) are designated as a 303(d) Impaired Waterbody due to high iron levels, which constitutes an impairment for aquatic life. The Nevada Administrative Code has established separate water quality standards for the upper and lower reaches of Edgewood Creek. The project site crosses the lower portion (from Palisades Drive to Lake Tahoe) and the water quality standards are described in Table 3.10-5. Table 3.10-5 Water Quality Standards for Lower Edgewood Creek  Parameter  Requirements to Maintain Existing Higher Quality  Water Quality Standards for Beneficial Uses  Temperature (˚C)    Oct. – May ≤ 10.0 June – Sept. ≤ 20.0  pH  7.0 – 8.4  6.5 – 9.0  Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L)    ≥ 6.0  Total Phosphates (mg/L)  ≤ 0.065  Annual Average ≤ 0.05  Nitrogen Species (mg/L)  Total Nitrogen ≤ 0.4  Nitrate ≤ 10.0 Nitrite ≤ 0.06  Unionized Ammonia (mg/L)    ≤ 0.004  Total Suspended Solids (mg/L)  ≤ 17.0  ≤ 25.0  Turbidity – NTU    ≤ 10.0  Color – PCU  No increase > 10  ≤ 75.0  Total Dissolved Solids (mg/L)    Annual Average ≤ 500.0  Chloride (mg/L)    ≤ 250.0  Sulfate (mg/L)    ≤ 250.0  Sodium – SAR    Annual Average ≤ 8.0  E. coli – No./100 mL    ≤ 126.0  Source: Nevada Administrative Code Section 445A.1666  The in-line pond system at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course was constructed to provide irrigation water storage and golf course amenities; however, the series of ponds and wetlands also provides water treatment. Ongoing monitoring of Edgewood Creek indicates that on an average monthly basis, all on and off-site nitrogen, phosphorus, and total suspended sediment entering the Edgewood pond system is treated to within TRPA and NDEP water quality standards; however, during storm events, nitrogen and phosphorus levels within the creek at the outfall to Lake Tahoe exceed water quality limits (Nichols Consulting Engineers et al. 2011:86 - 87). Golf Course Creek Golf Course Creek is located in the eastern portion of the study area in Nevada. The creek has two forks that converge immediately east of Lake Parkway, flow under the road via a culvert, and through a montane meadow before entering underground drains near the resort-casinos. Golf Course creek is piped beneath the resort-casinos and comingled with stormwater runoff before emerging in an earthen ditch that runs adjacent to the cart path on the eighth fairway at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course. Golf Course Creek joins with Edgewood Creek approximately 1,200 feet above the outfall to Lake Tahoe. The flow of Golf Course Creek is managed via headgates between resort-casinos—Harvey’s and the Hard Rock Hotel. Currently, the system is configured to direct baseflow through the Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course pond system (see discussion of stormwater management systems below), and the remnant reach of Golf Course Creek only flows during large storm events when it receives bypass stormwater from the SSWA system.  STORMWATER MANAGEMENT Stormwater runoff within the project site is managed by the three independent systems described below. Exhibit 3.10-2 provides an overview of the existing stormwater infrastructure.     Exhibit 3.10-2 Existing Stormwater Collection and Treatment   Rocky Point Stormwater System Drainage from the Fern Road, Echo Road, and Moss Road area is collected via storm drains and enters two drainage basins at the Fern Road/Pioneer Trail intersection. Overflow from these basins is routed west for additional treatment in the Upper and Lower Pine basins before discharging via the North Ditch to Lake Tahoe. In addition to drainage basins, several undeveloped lots within the Fern Road area were purchased by the California Tahoe Conservancy (CTC) as part of the Rocky Point Erosion Control Project. These lots provide a natural infiltration area for runoff from adjacent impervious areas and reduce the volume of runoff that must be treated in the drainage basin system. Any development on these parcels that affects their ability to accomplish this purpose would require mitigation.  Pine Boulevard Stormwater System Stormwater runoff from the California portion of US 50 in the Tourist Core is currently conveyed through a series of storm drains and drainage basins west of US 50, known as the Pine Boulevard Stormwater System or the North Ditch, before being discharged to Lake Tahoe. Flow from Stateline Creek crosses Montreal Road and enters the same storm drain system through a 42-inch reinforced concrete pipe and headwall near the southeast portion of the project site.  Stateline Stormwater Association Runoff from the Stateline casino corridor and Golf Course Creek is commingled beneath the resort-casinos. A diversion structure located between the Harvey’s property and the Hard Rock Hotel directs approximately 10 percent of the flow in the piped system to Golf Course Creek and approximately 90 percent to a series of sediment vaults under the Horizon parking lot. Runoff that passes through the vaults is then routed to pond 6 and then pond 10 on the Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course. Pond 6 is a constructed wet basin and is the final treatment component of the SSWA treatment system. Flows from pond 6 are then discharged to pond 10, before entering pond 1, which is an in‐line pond on Edgewood Creek. The Desert Research Institute monitored the effectiveness of the SSWA treatment system for 2 years in the early 2000s. The final report summarized research findings as follows (Desert Research Institute 2004):  Over the 2 years of monitoring, 25 storm events were sampled. The average reduction of pollutants from the treatment vaults were: 34 percent of the total nitrogen, 23 percent of the ammonia, 31 percent of the phosphate, and 46 percent of the total suspended solids. Through chemical reactions that occurred in the treatment vaults, an increase in nitrate by 34 percent and orthophosphate by 9 percent was observed.  The pond/constructed wet basin treatment system on the Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course (ponds 6 and 10) was sampled on a monthly basis in the spring and summer 2004. The wet basin system further reduced the nutrients and sediment due to the low‐energy environment, which allows settling of fine particles and uptake by vegetation. Additional water quality analyses of the wet basin treatment component of the SSWA treatment system (ponds 6 and 10) were conducted during the environmental review process for the Edgewood Lodge and Golf Course Improvement Project. This analysis used the Lake Tahoe Pollutant Load Reduction Model to develop a representation of the stormwater management system and well as physical measurements of sediment capture in the treatment ponds. The results indicate that the wet basin treatment system retains approximately 83,000 pounds of total suspended sediment per year. Almost 14,000 pounds per year of the retained sediment is estimated to be fine sediment particles (Nichols Consulting Engineers et al. 2011:26–41). SNOW STORAGE Snow storage along existing US 50 is limited due to right-of-way constraints. Snow management activities conducted by the City of South Lake Tahoe, Douglas County, NDOT, and Caltrans along the roadway affect the timing and amount of runoff. In response to snow and freezing rain events, Caltrans performs one or more of the following activities:  application of sand and salt to aid in traction;  use of high-efficiency sweepers to remove traction sand;  plowing the snow off the active traffic lanes, which is then stored in the two-way center turn lane;  collecting the snow from the right-of-way and trucking it to an off-site disposal yard, a practice typically performed in the urban area of South Lake Tahoe; and   returning after a snow event to remove any remaining snow from the roadway, shoulder and gutter. The application of sand and salt causes the snow and ice to melt at lower temperatures and sometimes runoff is produced during periods when the air temperature is at or below freezing. The plowing and collecting of snow to remove it from the surface of the roadways reduces the amount of snow available to generate runoff. The majority of the snow is typically removed from the roadway before it has a chance to melt. The roadway snow is collected and transported to a TRPA- and LRWCQB-approved disposal site; blown well into the woods adjacent to the roadway; or plowed beyond the curb and out of the drainage area so very little snow melt drains back to the roadway and into the storm drainage systems. Snowmelt is often a very slow process that occurs over several days with only a small amount of runoff generated on each of those days. Snow piles can contain trash, nutrients, fine sediments, salt, sand, pollutants from vehicles such as petroleum hydrocarbons, antifreeze, oil, or heavy metals and materials from road and tire wear. GROUNDWATER The most extensive and productive groundwater reservoirs (aquifers) in the Lake Tahoe Basin are composed of course textured alluvial deposits and deposits of glacial till and outwash. Five aquifers have been defined around the Lake Tahoe Basin, generally based on surface contact between basin fill and bedrock. The project site is located within the South Lake Tahoe/Stateline aquifer, which extends from Emerald Bay on the southwest side of the lake, to north of Stateline, Nevada on the southeast side (USGS 2007). The thickness of deposits, including the unsaturated zone, is highly variable within the South Lake Tahoe/Stateline aquifer. The portion of the aquifer located beneath the project site contains sand and gravel deposits extending 40 to 50 feet from the land surface, underlain by a sequence of clays with a similar thickness, followed in turn by more sand and gravel 50 or more feet thick. Because of the interbedded nature of coarse and fine-grained deposits, the aquifer is likely to include a shallow water table aquifer (perched above the first clay deposit) and one or more deeper confined aquifers (USGS 2007). Industrial pollutants (MTBE) have had a major impact on the groundwater supply in the South Lake Tahoe area. Low concentrations of volatile organics, primary inorganics, and radiological constituents have rendered 12 South Tahoe Public Utility District wells useless and have forced a reduction in pumping in one well (DWR 2013). Monitoring wells within the tourist core area indicate that the depth to groundwater is typically between 20 and 34 feet (Parikh Consultants 2011).  3.10.3 Environmental Consequences METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS This evaluation of potential water quality and stormwater management impacts was based on a review of documents pertaining to the project site, including: previous studies conducted for the watersheds within the study area; other environmental review documents; background reports prepared for plans and projects in the study area; and published and unpublished hydrologic literature. The information obtained from these sources was reviewed and summarized to understand existing conditions and to identify potential environmental effects, based on the thresholds of significance. In determining the level of significance, the analysis assumes that the project would comply with relevant federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and ordinances.  SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA NEPA Criteria An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the locally preferred action. Under NEPA, the significance of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are encompassed by the CEQA criteria used for this analysis. No specific factors related to water quality and stormwater management are contained in NEPA, CEQ Regulations Implementing NEPA, or FHWA NEPA regulations in 23 CFR 771 et seq. TRPA Criteria The “Water Quality” criteria from the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist were used to evaluate the water quality and stormwater runoff impacts of the alternatives. The project would result in a significant adverse impact if it would:  result in discharge into surface waters, or in any alteration of surface water quality, including but not limited to temperature, dissolved oxygen, or turbidity;  create changes in currents, or the course or direction of water movements;  change in the amount of surface water in any water body;  create changes in absorption rates, drainage patters, or the rate and amount of surface water runoff so that a 20 year 1-hour storm runoff (approximately 1 inch per hour) cannot be contained on the site;  alter the direction or rate of flow of groundwater;  result in the potential discharge of contaminants to the groundwater or any alteration of groundwater quality; or   adversely affect the quality of a drinking water source. CEQA Criteria In accordance with Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines, an alternative was determined to result in a significant impact related to water quality and stormwater runoff if it would:   violate any water quality standards or waste discharge requirements;  substantially alter the existing drainage pattern of the site or area, including through the alteration of the course of a stream or river, or substantially increase the rate or amount of surface runoff in a manner that would result in substantial erosion, siltation or flooding on- or off-site;   create or contribute runoff water that would exceed the capacity of existing or planned stormwater drainage, infiltration, and treatment systems or facilities resulting in increased sources of pollutants reaching surface waters or causing detrimental flooding to property or infrastructure;  substantially deplete groundwater supplies or interfere substantially with groundwater recharge such that there would be a net deficit in aquifer volume or a lowering of the local groundwater table level (e.g., the production rate of pre-existing nearby wells would drop to a level that would not support existing land uses or planned uses for which permits have been granted); or  otherwise substantially degrade water quality. ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF THE PROJECT ALTERNATIVES Impact 3.10-1: Potential for degradation of surface water quality due to construction activities Alternatives B, C, and D would include construction and operational activities that could result in contaminants being carried into storm drains and adjacent surface waters. Degradation of surface water quality could result from construction activities and pollutant loading in surface runoff. Because TRPA, Lahontan RWQCB, and NDEP regulations are in place to minimize erosion and transport of sediment and other pollutants during construction, and appropriate project-specific measures would be defined to secure necessary permits and approvals, project-related impacts would be minimized and would not result in substantial adverse effects on water quality. Alternative E could require construction dewatering; however, compliance with Lahontan RWQCB, NDEP, and TRPA regulations would minimize the potential threat to water quality. Alternative A is the no build alternative and would not impact these resources.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the degradation of surface water quality from construction activities such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; No Impact for Alternative A Alternatives B, C, and D would include the removal of existing roadway surfaces, grading and ground disturbance for modification of the existing roadbed, demolition and removal of up to 76 housing units, excavation, extension of culverts at Edgewood and Golf Course Creeks, temporary stockpiling of soil, and realignment of storm drain systems. These activities would create ground disturbance that could accelerate soil erosion. Soils exposed during rain events could generate sediment that could be carried in runoff into storm drains and surface waters. Vehicle traffic into and out of construction areas could carry sediment onto roadways where it could be ground into fine sediments. The amount of temporary and permanent soil disturbance for each alternative is shown in Table 3.10-6 below. Temporary disturbance areas would be stabilized and revegetated following construction as required by TRPA Code Section 61.4.  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Alternative A is the no build alternative and would not result in land disturbance or the potential for increased erosion or sedimentation. For this reason, Alternative A would have no impact on water quality for purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Table 3.10-6 Acres of Ground Disturbance by Alternative  Alternative/Segment  Acres of Ground Disturbance  Temporary  Permanent  Total  Alternative A: No Build (No Project)  0  0  0  Alternative B: Triangle  22.50  33.99  56.49  Alternative C: Triangle One-Way  24.20  28.00  52.20  Alternative D: PSR Alternative 2  19.88  32.51  52.39  Alternative E: Skywalk  0.76  0.03  0.79  Source: Adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2015  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Alternative B transportation improvements would require the demolition and removal of 76 housing units and would disturb 56.49 acres of soil, which could adversely affect water quality through construction activities (including accidental spills and possibly dewatering), changes to stormwater runoff patterns, or pollutant loading in stormwater runoff (including melt water from snow storage areas). This is the highest amount of soil disturbance that would be created by any build alternative.  With respect to construction water quality, all projects that disturb one or more acres of soil would be subject to the relevant NDEP and Lahontan RWQCB NPDES permits (depending on the portion of the project site, this may include the NDEP Stateline Stormwater Association NPDES Discharge Permit, the Caltrans Statewide NPDES Permit, and Lake Tahoe Basin Construction General NPDES Permit from Lahontan RWQCB). A condition of all the NPDES permits would be the preparation of a SWPPP. The SWPPP would be prepared by a qualified SWPPP practitioner and/or a qualified SWPPP developer that identifies water quality controls consistent with Lahontan RWQCB and TRPA requirements, and would ensure that runoff quality meets TRPA water quality requirements under the TRPA Code and maintains the beneficial uses of Lake Tahoe and Edgewood Creek. The SWPPP would describe the site controls, erosion and sediment controls, means of waste disposal, implementation of approved local plans, control of post-construction sediment and erosion control measures, and management controls unrelated to stormwater. BMPs identified in the SWPPP would be implemented during all site development activities. All construction site BMPs would follow the latest edition of the Caltrans Storm Water Quality Handbooks: Construction Site BMPs Manual (Caltrans 2003), the Nevada Contractors Field Guide for Construction Site Best Management Practices (NDEP 2008), and the TRPA BMP Handbook (TRPA 2014) to control and minimize the impacts of construction-related activities, materials, and pollutants on the watershed. The following would be required elements of the SWPPP:  Temporary BMPs to prevent the transport of earthen materials and other construction waste materials from disturbed land areas, stockpiles, and staging areas during periods of precipitation or runoff, including: filter fence, fiber roll, erosion control blankets, mulch (such as pine needles and wood chips), and temporary drainage swales and settling basins.  TRPA pre-grade inspection a minimum of 48 hours prior to commencement of construction-related activities to ensure proper and adequate installation of the temporary erosion control measures.   Designated contractor staging areas for materials and equipment storage outside of SEZ areas. Designated staging and storage areas would be protected by construction fencing and/or silt barriers, as appropriate. Following project completion, all areas used for staging would be restored in accordance with TRPA Code Section 61.4.  Temporary BMPs to prevent the tracking of earthen materials and other waste materials from the project site to offsite locations, including stabilized points of entry/exit for construction vehicles/equipment and designated vehicle/equipment rinse stations, and sweeping.  Temporary BMPs to prevent wind erosion of earthen materials and other waste materials from the project site, including routine application of water to disturbed land areas and covering of stockpiles with plastic or fabric sheeting.   Earthmoving activities would be limited to May 1 through October 15, unless a grading ordinance exemption is granted by TRPA. At the end of the grading season or before completion of the project, all surplus or waste earthen materials from the project site would be removed and disposed of at a TRPA-approved disposal site or stabilized on-site in accordance with TRPA regulations.  A spill prevention and containment plan would be prepared and implemented. Project contractors would be responsible for storing on-site materials and temporary BMPs capable of capturing and containing pollutants from fueling operations, fuel storage areas, and other areas used for the storage of hydrocarbon-based materials. This would include maintaining materials on-site (such as oil absorbent booms and sheets) for the cleanup of accidental spills, drip pans beneath construction equipment, training of site workers in spill response measures, immediate cleanup of spilled materials in accordance with directives from NDEP, Lahontan RWQCB, and TRPA, and proper disposal of waste materials at an approved off-site location that is licensed to receive such wastes.   Temporary BMPs to capture and contain pollutants generated by concrete construction including lined containment for rinsate to collect runoff from washing of concrete delivery trucks and equipment.  Protective fencing to prevent damage to trees and other vegetation to remain after construction, including tree protection fencing and individual tree protection such as wood slats strapped along the circumference of trees.  Temporary BMPs for the containment and removal of drilling spoils generated from construction of bridge foundations and abutments.  Daily inspection and maintenance of temporary BMPs. The prime contractor would be required to maintain a daily log of temporary construction site BMP inspections and keep the log on site during project construction for review by NDEP, Lahontan RWQCB, and TRPA.  Tree removal activities, including the dropping of trees, would be confined to the construction limit boundaries.  Construction boundary fencing to limit disturbance and prevent access to areas not under active construction. Construction associated with Alternative B would also require the use and handling of hazardous materials such as fuels, lubricants, coolants, hydraulic fluids, and cleaning solvents. The use and handling of these materials presents the potential to degrade water quality through accidental spills. Implementation of the hazardous materials spill response plan (a required component of the NPDES permit SWPPP) would reduce the potential of directly and indirectly effecting water quality through construction-related hazardous material spills.  Excavation for construction of the pedestrian bridge pilings would range from 20 to 60 feet deep, depending on the footings selected during final design. Excavation at these depths could encounter groundwater, and may require dewatering. The Lake Tahoe Hydrologic Unit Construction General allows dewatering operations provided that the dewatering discharge cannot be eliminated, complies with the BMPs described in the SWPPP, is filtered or treated, does not exceed numeric action levels for pH and turbidity, and would not cause or contribute to a violation of water quality standards (SWRCB 2009). Dewatering under this NDPES permit must not be used to clean up failed or inadequate construction or post-construction BMPs designed to keep materials onsite. The potential water quality effects resulting from these actions would be minimized through compliance with the applicable permits and regulations described above. Therefore, the potential for Alternative B transportation improvements to affect water quality would be a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the potential degradation of surface water quality from construction activities such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents, as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would involve ground disturbance related to site preparation and excavation, vegetation removal, and removal of existing structures as necessary. The mixed-use development sites under consideration all exceed 1 acre in size and would therefore be required to meet the NDEP and Lahontan RWQCB NPDES permit requirements described above.  Because TRPA, Lahontan RWQCB, and NDEP regulations are in place to minimize erosion and transport of sediment and other pollutants during construction, and appropriate project-specific measures would be defined to secure necessary permits and approvals, project-related impacts would be minimized and would not result in a substantial adverse effect on water quality. Therefore, the potential for Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to affect water quality would be a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize the potential degradation of surface water quality from construction activities such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential degradation of surface water quality from construction activities as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential water quality impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on water quality. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative B would minimize the potential degradation of surface water quality from construction activities such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Alternative C transportation improvements would require the demolition and removal of 71 housing units, and would disturb approximately 52.20 acres of soil (4.0 acres less than Alternative B). Alternative C would be subject to the same permitting requirements, including completion of a SWPPP and installation of permanent and temporary BMPs, as with Alternative B. The potential for adverse effects to water quality during rehabilitation would be minimized through compliance with the permits and regulations described above. For the same reasons described for Alternative B, the potential impact on surface water quality resulting from implementation of Alternative C transportation improvements would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the potential degradation of surface water quality from construction activities such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The mixed-use development, including replacement housing, considered with Alternative C is similar to that evaluated for Alternative B. The mixed-use development would be required to comply with the TRPA and Lahontan RWQCB NPDES permit conditions described for Alternative B. For the same reasons described for Alternative B, the potential impact on surface water quality resulting from implementation of Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would avoid or minimize the potential degradation of surface water quality from construction activities such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential degradation of surface water quality from construction activities as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential water quality impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on water quality. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative C would minimize the potential degradation of surface water quality from construction activities such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements Alternative D transportation improvements would require the demolition and removal of 68 housing units, and would disturb approximately 52.39 acres of soil (4.3 acres less than Alternative B). Alternative D would be subject to the same permitting requirements, including completion of a SWPPP and installation of permanent and temporary BMPs, as with Alternative B.  The potential for adverse effects on water quality during rehabilitation would be minimized through compliance with the permits and regulations described for Alternative B above. For the same reasons described for Alternative B, the potential impact on surface water quality resulting from implementation of Alternative D transportation improvements would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the potential degradation of surface water quality from construction activities such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The mixed-use development, including replacement housing, considered with Alternative D is similar to that evaluated for Alternative B. The mixed-use development would be required to comply with the TRPA and Lahontan RWQCB NPDES permit conditions described for Alternative B. For the same reasons described for Alternative B, the potential impact on surface water quality resulting from implementation of Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would avoid or minimize the potential degradation of surface water quality from construction activities such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential degradation of surface water quality from construction activities as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential water quality impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on water quality. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative D would minimize the potential degradation of surface water quality from construction activities such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alternative E: Skywalk Implementation of Alternative E would require excavation for the installation of footings and pilings to support the skywalk structure, resulting in approximately 0.79 acre of ground disturbance. Deep excavation within the project site could intercept groundwater and require dewatering activities during the construction phase. Water pumped from excavation activities would contain suspended sediments and other solids, but would not be discharged directly into SEZs, wetlands, or municipal storm drains.  Because ground disturbance would be less than 1 acre, construction activities for Alternative E would not be subject to NDEP or Lahontan RWQCB NPDES permits or the associated SWPPP measures; however, for projects that create less than 1 acre of disturbance, TRPA holds the regulatory responsibility for erosion control and water quality protection. TRPA requires the use of temporary water quality BMPs in accordance with the TRPA BMP Handbook and disposal of materials in a location approved by TRPA. Potential temporary BMPs may include measures similar to those required in a SWPPP as well as:  Inlet Protection – Storm drain inlets would be installed to prevent sediment from entering the stormwater management system. Inlet protection devices that could be used include fiber rolls, gravel bag barriers, geotextile fabric or pre-made device, silt fence, or block and gravel filter. Drain inlet protection devices would be inspected and maintained prior to forecast rain events, daily during extended rain events, after rain events, weekly during the rainy season, and at two-week intervals during the dry season.   Stock Pile Management – Stock piles would be located on paved areas away from drain inlets and SEZs. All stock piles would be protected from stormwater runoff using temporary perimeter sediment barriers, such as berms, dikes, fiber rolls, silt fences, or gravel bags. Stock piles would be covered with tarp, plastic, or other waterproof material overnight when precipitation is forecast.   Sweeping – This BMP includes daily sweeping of paved areas when grading activities are taking place. Sediment would be disposed of at a TRPA-approved location or removed from the Lake Tahoe Region.  Because Alternative E would disturb less than 1 acre and would be subject to TRPA oversight and the permit requirements discussed above, the potential for Alternative E to adversely affect surface water quality would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize the potential degradation of surface water quality from construction activities such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Impact 3.10-2: Potential for degradation of surface water quality due to operational activities TRPA, Lahontan RWQCB, and NDEP regulations require the installation and maintenance of water quality BMPs, which would minimize the potential water quality effects of the transportation improvements. Also, TRPA Code provisions would require fertilizer management and snow storage BMPs to prevent potential adverse effect from these activities. In addition, Alternative B, C, and D include several water quality improvements that would resolve preexisting detrimental conditions within the project site and add supplemental capacity to water quality treatment basins above required volumes. Alternative E would minimize the potential effects to water quality by implementing required stormwater infrastructure. Alternatives A is the no build alternative and would have no impact relative to these resources. NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the degradation of surface water quality from operations such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Beneficial for Alternatives B, C, and D; Less Than Significant for Alternative E; No Impact for Alternative A Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Alternative A is the no build alternative; it would be a continuation of existing conditions and would not result in a change in land use or modification of roadways systems that could result in changes to water quality. For this reason, Alternative A would have no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Importantly, taking no action, as with Alternative A, would not result in implementation of the beneficial water quality improvements associated with Alternatives B, C, and D.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Alternative B transportation improvements would result in a net increase of between 5.47 acres (with roundabout at US 50/Lake Parkway) and 7.62 acres (with signal at US 50/Lake Parkway) in land coverage within the project site (see Impact 3.11-1 in Section 3.11, “Geology, Soils, Land Capability, and Coverage”). The runoff generated by the roadway portions of the project could contain sediment, crushed road abrasives, nutrients, organic compounds, trash and debris, oxygen-demanding substances, oil and grease, fluids from accidents and spills, landscape care products, and metals. In addition, the roadway abrasives used during winter are ground down by the vehicle traffic and become suspended in stormwater runoff. For these reasons, paved roadways are the primary source of the fine sediment particles that are impairing the clarity of Lake Tahoe (Lahontan RWQCB and NDEP 2010). The NPDES permits required for the project state that BMPs must be implemented to reduce the potential discharge of these pollutants to the maximum extent practicable. Both the effluent and the receiving water must be monitored to ensure that the BMPs are effective and that the discharge is not causing or contributing to an exceedance of a Water Quality Standard. The results of monitoring efforts must be used to make adjustments or revisions to the BMPs as appropriate (SWRCB 2013, NDOT 2013). Alternative B would include landscaping of roundabout centers and roadway medians, and revegetation of disturbed areas. Fertilizers or organic amendments used in landscaping and restoration projects can move into surface and groundwaters and degrade water quality. These impacts can be avoided or minimized through proper handling and application of fertilizers and amendments and the selection of plant species that are appropriate for the site. All projects that include landscaping or revegetation must develop a fertilizer management program as described in TRPA Code Section 60.1.8.A. Additionally, projects requiring revegetation must submit a revegetation plan that specifies the use of approved plant species and a schedule of the amount and method of application of any necessary fertilizers in accordance with TRPA Code Section 61.4.5. TRPA Code of Ordinances section 36.7 and the TRPA Handbook of Best Management Practices (TRPA 2011) require that landscaped areas use native or adapted plant species that require little water and fertilizer and are appropriate for the site conditions. Because Alternative B would be required to comply with these provisions as a condition of permit approval, the risk to water quality from the migration of fertilizers or organic amendments would be minimized.  Melt water from snow storage areas carries concentrated amounts of nutrients, fine sediments, salt, sand pollutants from vehicles such as petroleum hydrocarbons, oil, or heavy metals and materials from road and tire wear. Snow storage areas along the existing US 50 alignment are limited due to right-of-way constraints. Provision of adequate snow storage is required by Douglas County, City of South Lake Tahoe, and TRPA regulations. The proposed US 50 alignment would provide potential for snow storage within some parcels acquired for right-of-way purposes. All potential snow storage locations would be designed to drain to BMP facilities capable of treating large sediment loads. In accordance with TRPA Code Section 60.1.4, all snow storage areas would meet the site criteria and management standards in the TRPA Handbook of Best Management Practices (TRPA 2014). In addition, snow storage areas may not be located within SEZs. The location of snow storage areas within the City of South Lake Tahoe would be shown on all site plans or a snow removal plan would be included with the improvement plan submittal. In addition to the water quality protections in the required NPDES permits, TRPA has established numeric water quality standards for discharges to surface and ground waters. Section 61.1 of the TRPA Code specifies that water discharged to surface waters or infiltrated into soils should not contain excessive amounts of nutrients, sediment, or oil and grease. The TRPA numeric discharge limits are shown in Table 3.10-2 above. Where there is a direct hydrologic connection between ground and surface waters, discharge to groundwater must meet surface water discharge standards. The existence of a direct hydrologic connection is assumed to exist when, due to proximity to surface water, slope, or soil characteristics, the discharged water does not remain in the soil long enough to remove pollutants.  Water Quality Enhancement Through coordination with stakeholders and a review of the strengths and weaknesses of the existing stormwater management systems within the project area, the project design team identified several measures that would enhance the ability of existing systems to protect water quality, and would create water quality benefits through the capture of currently untreated stormwater runoff. These enhancements are included as part of Alternative B and are described below:    US 50 /SR 207 Stormwater Improvements: The portion of US 50 from the intersection of Lake Parkway to State Route 207 currently discharges directly into Edgewood Creek without treatment. The proposed water quality improvements include a treatment train that consists of sediment traps, an underground storm drain system to convey flows, and an stormwater basin located to the southwest of the US 50/Lake Parkway intersection (B-11 on Exhibit 3.10-3) The basin site has sufficient room to provide the required capacity for the water quality volume. The required regulatory water quality volume (20-year/1-hour storm) is approximately 27,000 cubic feet and the potential basin volume is 91,000 cubic feet.   Stateline Avenue Stormwater Improvements: Currently, the north side of Stateline Avenue contains no water quality treatment features. Alternative B would improve water quality by installing curb and gutter and stabilizing previously bare shoulders. The existing area drain at the intersection of Stateline Avenue and Lake Parkway is surrounded by unstable soils and frequently clogs, allowing stormwater to be directly discharged to Lake Tahoe via the overflow pipe (Burke, Pers. Com. 2016). Alternative B would improve the functionality of this system and would direct runoff from the intersection area and Stateline Avenue to a new stormwater basin located northeast of the Lake Parkway/Pine Boulevard and Stateline Avenue intersection (displayed as B-13 on Exhibit 3.10-3). The basin would be located downstream of the improvements along Stateline Avenue and would be designed to accommodate the existing trees in the area. The required water quality volume is approximately 7,200 cubic feet and the potential basin volume is 27,000 cubic feet. A second option to treat runoff from Stateline Avenue would be to modify the existing Stateline Stormwater Association (SSWA) treatment system. There is an existing basin along Lake Parkway within the Harvey’s Lake Tahoe property. This basin serves the existing SSWA treatment system. Runoff from Stateline Avenue can be routed to this basin and modifications can be made to the facility to accommodate the increase in flow.   Azure Avenue Stormwater Improvements: Currently, stormwater runoff from the residential block of Azure Avenue between Pine Boulevard and Stateline Avenue is discharged directly to Lake Tahoe without treatment (Burke, pers. comm., 2016). The project would assess the potential for capturing this runoff and diverting it to proposed basin B-13 via an underground storm drain system. The City of South Lake Tahoe has identified this as a need, but cannot confirm the location or depth of the Azure Avenue storm drain pipe. During the project design phase, a survey would be completed to verify that the Azure Avenue storm drain pipe is at a shallow enough depth to connect to proposed basin B-13. If this connection is feasible, the basin would be sized to accommodate both the uncaptured runoff from Stateline Avenue and the untreated runoff from a portion of the residential neighborhood south of Azure Avenue. This improvement could provide treatment for approximately one-third of the stormwater from the residential neighborhood and could trap up to 1,300 pounds of fine sediment annually (City of South Lake Tahoe 2016). As needed, facilities to collect runoff on Azure Avenue and divert it to the basin would be constructed by the City of South Lake Tahoe as part of a separate project.   Sediment Traps: All existing drainage inlets within the project site would be modified to include a sediment trap to remove sediment and applied roadway abrasives (i.e., traction sand). These sediment traps would provide a “Treatment Train” by removing heavy sediments prior to storm water discharges. Approximately 85 new sediment traps would be included with the proposed transportation improvements.   Existing US 50 Stormwater Infrastructure Improvements: The portion of the existing US 50 alignment between Stateline Avenue and Park Avenue currently has very few drainage inlets. Although subsurface storm drains exist along Friday Avenue, no inlets have been constructed. This requires stormwater to travel over-ground along the unimproved road shoulder to drainage inlets near the intersection of Manzanita Avenue and Friday Avenue. The conversion of existing US 50 to a local street and planned pedestrian improvements would include the addition of storm drain infrastructure including curb and gutter, drainage inlets spaced approximately 250 feet apart, and subsurface storm drain pipe along existing US 50. This system would connect to the Friday Avenue storm drain system via drainage inlets near the junction of existing US 50 and Friday Avenue and would prevent stormwater runoff from running down Friday Avenue in an open system. Although these enhancements would not create a reduction in stormwater runoff. Rather, they would direct stormwater to stormwater basins through an efficient system that reduces stormwater contact with unstabilized road shoulders.  Fern Basin Enhancements: Drainage from the Fern Road, Echo Road, and Moss Road area is collected via storm drains and enters two drainage basins at the intersection of Fern Road and Pioneer Trail. These basins are currently undersized and only capture 77 percent of the 20-year, 1-hour stormwater runoff volume (City of South Lake Tahoe 2016). The proposed roadway alignment may require reconstruction or relocation of these basins. Both the existing basins (EX-01 and -02) and the proposed basin configuration (B-09) are shown on Exhibit 3.10-3. Alternative B would redirect approximately 100,200 cubic feet/year of stormwater runoff generated by the realigned US 50 from the Fern Basins to proposed basins B-02, B-04, B-05, B-07, and B-08. However, even with this volume reduction, preliminary calculations indicate that the Fern Basins would still be undersized (Wood Rodgers 2016). For this reason, Alternative B would reconstruct (enlarge and deepen) the Fern Basins in their current location so that they are able to fully accommodate the stormwater runoff generated by their tributary area during the 20-year/1-hour storm. The capacity of the existing basins combined is approximately 48,000 cubic feet. The potential capacity of the proposed reconstructed basins is approximately 80,000 cubic feet (Wood Rodgers 2016). If further studies indicate against the reconstruction of the basins on site, the project would also consider the possibility of relocating the Fern Basins or adding an additional basin to the system.   Oversized Stormwater basins: The project would generate excess right-of-way, which can be utilized for features such as linear parkways and stormwater stormwater basins. The area available for stormwater basins surpasses the amount of area necessary to contain the required water quality volume. The depth of all basins proposed for the project was assumed to be three feet and all stormwater basins would have a preliminary side slope of 3:1. TRPA requires all projects to infiltrate or retain the volume of stormwater runoff generated by a 20-year, 1-hour storm on the project site. The preliminary design of the project’s stormwater basins indicates that, on average, they can accommodate five times the regulatory requirement (Wood Rodgers 2016) and are therefore able to accept flows from a much larger storm.  For these reasons, implementation of Alternative B transportation improvements would result in a beneficial impact on water quality for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the potential degradation of surface water quality from operations such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would include landscaping and snow removal, which could result in the migration of urban pollutants into surface and groundwater. The TRPA Code provisions cited above in regard to the transportation-related components of the project would also apply to the mixed-use development sites. Because all landscaping and snow storage areas would be required to comply with these water quality protections, the operation of the mixed-use development site would not have an adverse effect on water quality.    Exhibit 3.10-3 Alternative B – Potential Stormwater Basin Locations TRPA, Lahontan RWQCB, and NDEP regulations require the installation and maintenance of water quality BMPs, which would minimize the potential water quality effects of the transportation improvements. Also, TRPA Code provisions would require fertilizer management and snow storage BMPs to prevent potential adverse effects from these activities. In addition, Alternative B includes several water quality improvements that would resolve preexisting detrimental conditions within the project site and add supplemental capacity to stormwater treatment basins above required volumes. Therefore, the implementation of Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a beneficial impact on water quality for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize the potential degradation of surface water quality from operations such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential degradation of surface water quality from operations as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential water quality impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a beneficial impact on water quality. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative B would minimize the potential degradation of surface water quality from operations such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Alternative C transportation improvements would result in a net increase of 1.06 acres (with signal at US 50/Lake Parkway) in land coverage within the project site (see Impact 3.11-1 in Section 3.11, “Geology, Soils, Land Capability, and Coverage”). Alternative C would be subject to the same permitting requirements, including completion of a SWPPP, installation of permanent and temporary BMPs, and TRPA fertilizer use restrictions as with Alternative B. In addition, Alternative C would include similar water quality improvements as those described for Alternative B (shown on Exhibit 3.10-4). The potential water quality effects of Alternative C would be the same as those for the transportation improvement portion of Alternative B, described above. For these reasons, implementation of Alternative C transportation improvements would result in a beneficial impact on water quality for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the potential degradation of surface water quality from operations such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The water quality effects of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, considered under Alternative C would be the same as those evaluated for Alternative B, above.  For the same reasons described above in regard to Alternative B, the implementation of Alternative C mixed-use, including replacement housing, would have a beneficial impact on water quality for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would avoid or minimize the potential degradation of surface water quality from operations such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential degradation of surface water quality from operations as described for the mixed-use development sites.

Alternative D would be subject to the same permitting requirements, including completion of a SWPPP, installation of permanent and temporary BMPs, and TRPA fertilizer use restrictions as with Alternative B. In addition, Alternative D would include similar water quality improvements as those described for Alternative B (shown on Exhibit 3.10-5).  The potential water quality effects of Alternative D would be the same as those for the roadway portion of Alternative B, described above. For these reasons, implementation of Alternative D transportation improvements would result in a beneficial impact on water quality for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the potential degradation of surface water quality from operations such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.    Exhibit 3.10-4 Alternative C – Potential Stormwater Basin Locations   Exhibit 3.10-5 Alternative D – Potential Stormwater Basin Locations Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The water quality effects of the conceptual mixed-use development considered under Alternative D would be the same as those evaluated for Alternative B, above.  For the same reasons described above in regard to Alternative B, the implementation of Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would have a beneficial impact on water quality for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would avoid or minimize the potential degradation of surface water quality from operations such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential degradation of surface water quality from operations as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential water quality impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a beneficial impact on water quality. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative D would minimize the potential degradation of surface water quality from operations such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alternative E: Skywalk The operational water quality effects of Alternative E would be minimal. Stormwater runoff from the pedestrian deck would not contain the roadway pollutants described for Alternative B and landscaping would be limited to container plantings. Additionally, all stormwater generated by the pedestrian deck would be treated by the existing SSWA system. Therefore, the operation of Alternative E would have a less-than-significant impact on water quality for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize the potential degradation of surface water quality from operations such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.   Impact 3.10-3: Stormwater runoff Alternatives B, C, and D would create an increase in impervious surfaces: 5.47 to 7.62 acres for Alternative B; 1.06 acres for Alternative C; and 5.76 to 7.91 acres for Alternative D. The project would be required to comply with stringent SWRCB, Lahontan RWQCB, NDEP, and TRPA post-construction stormwater controls. Storage, infiltration, and treatment measures are required to minimize runoff flows and volumes and any stormwater discharge would be required to comply with Lahontan RWQCB, NDEP, and TRPA water quality standards and the Lake Tahoe TMDL. Because the implementation of these alternatives could require use of existing stormwater management infrastructure (Rocky Point stormwater easement parcels and Fern Road stormwater basins) for transportation improvements and/or mixed-use development, an impact on stormwater runoff management is recognized at this time, which would be mitigated by replacing affected facilities with equivalently or more effective stormwater infrastructure, as defined during detailed project design. Alternatives A and E would not result in changes to runoff volumes or stormwater infrastructure and would therefore have no impact relative to these resources.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: Mitigation Measure 3.10-3 have been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to stormwater runoff; No Impact for Alternatives A and E CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, and D after implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.10-3; No Impact for Alternatives A and E The amount of stormwater runoff generated from an area is affected by development through conversion of vegetated or pervious surfaces to impervious surfaces and by the development of drainage systems that connect these impervious surfaces to streams or other water bodies. In this way, development can increase the rate of runoff and eliminate storage and infiltration that would naturally occur along drainage paths. As water runs off the land surface, it collects and carries materials and sediment, which can be potentially harmful to downstream receiving waters. Additionally, stormwater runoff that becomes concentrated can cause erosion and increased sediment transport.  Alternatives B, C, and D would include realignment of US 50, widening of existing roadways, construction of a pedestrian path, modifications to the existing US 50 to become a local street, and realignment of neighborhood streets to connect with the highway. Table 3.10-7 (below) provides the estimated increase in impervious area by alternative.  As shown in Table 3.10-7, Alternatives B, C, and D would result in an increase in impervious surfaces within the project site and a corresponding increase in runoff volume. These alternatives would also relocate or change the configuration of the existing storm drain systems (refer to Exhibit 3.10-2). Where the existing storm drain systems affected by each action alternative are undersized or under-designed, they would be improved. Inlets and pipes would be relocated to accommodate the different roadway configurations and sized per regulatory and code requirements.  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Alternative A is the no build alternative and would not create increased impervious coverage or alter existing stormwater infrastructure. For this reason, Alternative A would have no impact on stormwater runoff for purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.    Table 3.10-7 Increase in Impervious Surfaces by Alternative  Alternative  New Impervious Surface  Affected Storm Drain Systems  Alternative A: No Build (No Project)  NA  NA  Alternative B: Triangle  5.47 to 7.62 acres  CSLT Fern Road Stormwater Basins (2) CTC Rocky Point Stormwater Treatment Parcels: 029-331-12, 029-331-11, and 029-332-01 CTC Rocky Point Stormwater Easements: 029-170-05, 029-170-04, 029-351-22, 029-341-04, and 029-363-07  Existing Storm Drains: 2.5 miles  Alternative C: Triangle One-Way  1.06 acres  CSLT Fern Road Stormwater Basins (2) CTC Rocky Point Stormwater Treatment Parcels: 029-331-12, 029-331-11, and 029-332-01 CTC Rocky Point Stormwater Easements: 029-170-05, 029-170-04, 029-351-22, 029-341-04, and 029-363-07 Existing Storm Drains: 2.1 miles  Alternative D: PSR Alternative 2  5.76 to 7.91 acres  CSLT Fern Road Stormwater Basins (2) CTC Rocky Point Stormwater Treatment Parcels: 029-331-12, 029-331-11, and 029-332-01 CTC Rocky Point Stormwater Easements: 029-170-05, 029-170-04, 029-343-17, and 029-341-04 Existing Storm Drains: 2.4 miles  Alternative E: Skywalk  NA  NA  CTC = California Tahoe Conservancy; CSLT = City of South Lake Tahoe; NA = not applicable  Source: Wood Rodgers 2015; adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2016  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Alternative B transportation improvements would create an increase in impervious surfaces of 5.47 acres with the proposed roundabout at the existing US 50/Lake Parkway intersection or 7.62 acres if that intersection were signalized. This would result in a corresponding increase in runoff volume and pollutant loading. The additional runoff generated by the project would be conveyed to the existing storm drain systems, as well as new storm drain systems that would be developed as components of the project.  A Stormwater Data Report would be prepared for the project and would evaluate all required BMPs for implementation. All runoff from Alternative B would be conveyed through permanent BMPs and Low Impact Development (LID) features to properly manage and treat the increased runoff velocity and volume. The types of BMPs that would be included in the project design are pollution prevention, runoff treatment, and temporary construction site BMPs. Specific treatment BMPs under consideration for this project include sand traps, biofiltration swales, and stormwater basins. Exhibit 3.10-3 shows the potential locations of stormwater basins installed to capture stormwater runoff from the Alternative B roadways. These basins would be located in the available right-of-way. The area available for water quality basins surpasses the amount of area necessary to contain the required water quality volume. Given the available area for stormwater basin and an assumed basin depth of three feet, the potential volume of stormwater that could be captured by the basin far exceeds the regulatory requirements. As required by Section 60.4.6 of the TRPA Code, the project would be designed to meet the infiltration requirements of a 20-year, 1-hour design storm event. The Lahontan RWQCB has estimated that facilities designed to treat or infiltrate this size of storm event effectively capture approximately 85 percent of the average annual runoff volume (SWRCB 2013). The combined volumes of the stormwater basins would exceed the regulatory requirements by an average of 500 percent and would be able to accept flows from a much larger storm (Wood Rodgers 2016). The proposed alignment of Alternative B would affect the existing stormwater infrastructure systems described in Table 3.10-7. Approximately 2.5 miles of storm drain would be intersected by Alternative B, including components of the SSWA and City of South Lake Tahoe storm drain systems. These systems would be reconstructed or improved as required to meet the increase in runoff volume generated by the project. The Fern Road Basins (owned by the City of South Lake Tahoe) would require reconstruction due to the disturbance caused by the widening of the adjacent roadway. These basins could potentially be expanded into the Rocky Point Stormwater Treatment parcels 029-331-11 and 029-331-12, similar to parcel 029-332-01, which is currently the site of the southernmost Fern Road Stormwater Basin. Portions of the Rocky Point Stormwater Easement parcels (see Table 3.10-7) would be permanently modified by the roadway realignment. Modifications could include the alteration of drainage paths or stormwater conveyance structures, or the reduction of natural areas currently used for infiltration of runoff. The Rocky Point Stormwater Project parcels, which were purchased by the Conservancy, currently provide a water quality benefit through infiltration or conveyance of stormwater runoff. The project-related modifications to these parcels could reduce their ability to meet the water quality goals for which they were purchased.  In summary, Alternative B transportation improvements would result in an increase in impervious surfaces, its implementation would require compliance with stringent SWRCB, Lahontan RWQCB, NDEP, and TRPA post-construction stormwater controls. Storage, infiltration, and treatment measures would be required to minimize runoff flows and volumes and prevent erosion and flooding downstream of the project site. Additionally, stormwater discharges would be required to comply with Lahontan RWQCB, NDEP, and TRPA water quality standards and the Lake Tahoe TMDL. However, the implementation of this alternative could reduce the capacity or effectiveness of existing stormwater basins and the infiltration capability of the previously described Rocky Point stormwater parcels. Because Alternative B transportation improvements would adversely affect existing stormwater management infrastructure, this would be a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to stormwater runoff.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents, as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements.  Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would include the potential for construction of up to 227 new residential units on Sites 1, 2, and 3, and would add 5.76 acres of new impervious surfaces for the roundabout option or 7.62 acres for the signalized option, before reductions are made for transfer of excess allowable land coverage. All new construction would be required to meet TRPA stormwater management standards, including the mandate to fully infiltrate the runoff generated by the 20-year, 1-hour design storm or, if site constraints prevent this, to convey it to an off-site shared stormwater system approved by TRPA. The portions of the mixed-use sites that are within the Town Center designated in the Tourist Core Area Plan would be permitted a larger area of impervious coverage for high capability lands; however, any coverage exceeding the base allowable would be purchased and transferred from outside areas. This pattern of development reflects the goals of the Lake Tahoe Regional Plan (TRPA 2012b:2-10 to 2-14). Because the conceptual development would be required to infiltrate stormwater runoff from the design storm and would be accompanied by the transfer and restoration of land coverage from areas outside of the Town Center, the mixed-use development concept, including replacement housing, would result in a water quality benefit.  One of the potential sites for mixed-use development would encroach on the Fern Road Basins (owned by the City of South Lake Tahoe). These basins could potentially be expanded into the Rocky Point Treatment Parcels 029-331-11 and 029-331-12 (parcel 029-332-01 is currently the site of the southernmost Fern Road basin). It should be noted that the capacity of the existing basins combined is approximately 48,000 cubic feet. The potential capacity of the reconstructed basins at the proposed location could exceed 80,000 cubic feet (Wood Rodgers 2016). Although Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in an increase in impervious surfaces, its implementation would require compliance with stringent SWRCB, Lahontan RWQCB, NDEP, and TRPA post-construction stormwater controls, as described above, as well as Lahontan RWQCB, NDEP, and TRPA water quality standards and the Lake Tahoe TMDL. However, the implementation of this alternative could reduce the capacity or effectiveness of existing stormwater basins and the infiltration capability of the Rocky Point stormwater parcels. Because Alternative B would require use of existing stormwater management infrastructure for mixed-use development, there would be a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into construction of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to stormwater runoff. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for stormwater runoff environmental consequences as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential impacts related to stormwater runoff would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would result in a significant impact from the potential for stormwater runoff environmental consequences. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into construction of the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to stormwater runoff.  Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements The effects of Alternative C transportation improvements on stormwater runoff would be similar to those described for Alternative B above. Alternative C would result in 1.06 acre of increase in impervious surfaces, which is 4.41 to 6.56 acres less than Alternative B. Despite this decrease in coverage relative to Alternative B, Alternative C would affect much of the same existing stormwater infrastructure, as shown in Table 3.10-7.  For the same reasons described above, Alternative C transportation improvements would be required to minimize runoff flows and volumes and all stormwater discharge would meet Lahontan RWQCB, NDEP, and TRPA water quality standards. As with Alternative B, stormwater runoff would be captured in stormwater basins (see Exhibit 3.10-4) with a storage capacity well in excess of the regulatory requirements. However, because Alternative C would adversely affect existing stormwater management infrastructure, including the Rocky Point stormwater parcels, this would be a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to stormwater runoff. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Alternative D would result in 5.76 to 7.91 acres of increase in impervious surfaces, which is an increase of 0.29 acre compared to Alternative B. Alternative D would affect much of the same existing stormwater infrastructure, as shown in Table 3.10-7, but would intersect one less parcel of the Rocky Point stormwater system.  As with Alternative B, stormwater runoff would be captured in stormwater basins (see Exhibit 3.10-5) with a storage capacity well in excess of the regulatory requirements. For the same reasons described above, Alternative D would be required to minimize runoff flows and volumes and all stormwater discharge would meet Lahontan RWQCB, NDEP, and TRPA water quality standards. However, because Alternative D transportation improvements would adversely affect existing stormwater management infrastructure, including the Rocky Point stormwater parcels, this would be a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to stormwater runoff.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would include the potential for construction of up to 224 new residential units on Sites 1, 2, and 3 and would add 5.76 to 7.91 acres of new impervious surfaces, before reductions are made for transfer of excess allowable land coverage. The stormwater runoff impacts of Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would be the same as those discussed for Alternative B above.  For the same reasons described above, Alternative D would be required to minimize runoff flows and volumes and all stormwater discharge would meet Lahontan RWQCB, NDEP, and TRPA water quality standards.

Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would result in a significant impact from the stormwater runoff environmental consequences. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into construction of the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to stormwater runoff.  Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E would create an impervious deck over an existing impervious surface and would therefore not create additional runoff volumes. Stormwater would be directed from the deck to existing drop-inlets along US 50; however, Alternative E would not modify or adversely affect existing stormwater infrastructure. Therefore, this alternative would have no impact relative to stormwater runoff for purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Impact 3.10-4: Potential to affect groundwater through infiltration of polluted water or during excavation activities Alternatives B, C, and D have the potential to affect groundwater through infiltration of polluted stormwater runoff in areas of shallow groundwater; however, this potential would be minimized through compliance with TRPA discharge limits and installation of water quality BMPs. Although Alternatives B, C, and D could involve excavation or construction activities that intercept groundwater, these activities would occur in accordance with TRPA Code requirements and would not alter the flow or direction of groundwater. Finally, although the project site is located near several drinking water wells, the land uses and activities proposed by the project present a minimal threat to these resources. Alternative E also has the potential to intercept groundwater during excavation activities; however, all excavation would occur in accordance with TRPA regulations and would not alter the flow or direction of groundwater. Alternative A is the no build alternative and would have no impact on groundwater resources. NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the effects on groundwater such that no additional mitigation measures are needed of feasible to implement; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; No Impact for Alternative A Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Alternative A is the no build alternative and would not intercept groundwater or alter the existing level of urban contaminants that occur in runoff infiltrated into the soil. For this reason, Alternative A would have no impact on groundwater resources for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements The project site contains some areas of shallow groundwater (such as wetland and SEZ habitats) and areas where the seasonal groundwater table might be intercepted by deep excavation. In general, the soil environment provides biological and physical filtering for water as it infiltrates; however, in areas where groundwater tables are shallow, contaminants can migrate directly into groundwater aquifers and adversely affect groundwater quality.  Groundwater interception or interference is prohibited under TRPA Code Section 33.3.6. Exceptions are permitted on a case-by-case basis for situations where there are no viable alternatives and measures would be taken to avoid adverse impacts. Whenever excavations would be greater than 5 feet, a soils hydrologic report must be prepared to demonstrate that no interference would occur or that measures are incorporated to maintain groundwater flows, avoid impacts on SEZ vegetation, and prevent any groundwater from leaving the project site as subsurface flow. While the potential exists for project-related excavation to intercept groundwater, none of the project components would interfere with or redirect the flow of groundwater or alter the elevation of groundwater. Dewatering (in compliance with the NPDES permits discussed above) would be required in areas of high groundwater; however, this activity would be temporary and isolated and would not affect the availability of groundwater for public use. Additionally, all build alternatives would follow TRPA’s grading ordinances requiring prior investigation and reporting of any potential interruption or redirection of groundwater flow for review and approval. Alternative B transportation improvements would generate common urban pollutants (described under Impact 3.10-1) that would be carried with runoff and could infiltrate into the soil. Section 61.1 of the TRPA Code specifies that water infiltrated into soils should not contain excessive amount of nutrients, sediment, or oil and grease. Where a direct hydrologic connection exists between groundwater and surface waters (such as in riparian areas), discharge to groundwater must meet surface water discharge standards. The existence of a direct hydrologic connection is assumed to exist when, because of proximity to surface water, slope, or soil characteristics, the discharged water does not remain in the soil long enough to remove pollutants. The TRPA numeric discharge limits for surface water and groundwater are shown in Table 3.10-2.  The project site is within the 600-foot buffer zone of 15 active privately-owned wells and two inactive public wells (TRPA 2004). Because the project would not add any industrial land uses that could release contaminants into deep groundwater aquifers, the potential threat to these wells is minimal. The common urban pollutants generated by roadways, landscaped areas, and residential or mixed-use development are managed through the required installation and maintenance of permanent BMPs and through the TRPA standards for discharge to groundwater. For these reasons, the potential for Alternative B transportation improvements to adversely affect groundwater resources would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the groundwater environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents, as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would be required to comply with the same TRPA requirements for protection of groundwater discussed above. Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, has the potential to affect groundwater through infiltration of polluted stormwater runoff in areas of shallow groundwater; however, this potential would be minimized through compliance with TRPA discharge limits and through the installation of water quality BMPs as discussed above. Although Alternative B could involve excavation or construction activities that intercept groundwater, these activities would occur in accordance with TRPA Code requirements. Finally, although Alternative B is located near several drinking water wells, the land uses and activities proposed by the project present a minimal threat to these resources. For these reasons, the potential for Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to adversely affect groundwater resources would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize the impacts on groundwater such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for groundwater environmental consequences as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential groundwater impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on groundwater. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative B would minimize the groundwater environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements The effects of Alternative C transportation improvements on groundwater resources would be the same as described for Alternative B.

Alternative C would be required to comply with TRPA discharge limits, water quality BMPs requiring separation of runoff and groundwater, and completion of a soils/hydrology study for deep excavations and would not include industrial land uses. For these reasons, the potential for Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to adversely affect groundwater resources would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would avoid or minimize the impacts on groundwater such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for groundwater environmental consequences as described for the mixed-use development sites.

The project would be required to comply with TRPA discharge limits and install water quality BMPs as discussed above. For these reasons, the potential for Alternative D transportation improvements to adversely affect groundwater resources would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the groundwater environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on groundwater. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative D would minimize the groundwater environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E would affect groundwater only through the potential interception of groundwater during excavation for the construction of the skywalk piers. As required by TRPA and as described above for Alternative B, the project would be required to prepare a soils/hydrologic report to demonstrate that no interference would occur or that measures are incorporated to maintain groundwater flows, avoid impacts on SEZ vegetation, and prevent any groundwater from leaving the project site as subsurface flow. Therefore, the potential for Alternative E to affect the flow or direction of groundwater would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize the groundwater environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. 3.10.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures Mitigation Measure 3.10-3: Protect functionality of Rocky Point Stormwater Improvements This mitigation measure applies to Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  The project proponent shall demonstrate that all Rocky Point Stormwater Improvements continue to meet the goals for which they were established, including meeting or exceeding 6.4 pounds of sediment reduction per State of California dollar spent on site improvements. If the functionality of the Rocky Point property and facilities cannot be maintained, the project design would be modified to replace these facilities with land and infrastructure that is at least as effective as the current facilities, or more effective. In the event that any portion of the project encroaches on the existing City of South Lake Tahoe stormwater basins at Fern Road, these basins would be reconstructed in place or replaced in-kind within available right-of-way. The net result would be the maintenance of existing stormwater facilities or the replacement of affected facilities with equivalently or more effective stormwater management land and infrastructure. The specific location and design of the replacement infrastructure would be defined during detailed design development. Significance after Mitigation The implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.10-3 would avoid or compensate for the potential of the project to adversely affect the functionality of existing stormwater infrastructure systems. This mitigation measure would reduce the potential impacts on existing stormwater infrastructure to a less-than-significant level for Alternatives B, C, and D for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the environmental consequences of implementing Alternatives B, C, and D with Mitigation Measure 3.10-3 would not be adverse. 3.11 GEOLOGY, SOILS, LAND CAPABILITY, AND COVERAGE This section contains an evaluation of the potential impacts on geology, soils, land capability, and coverage associated with the implementation of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project alternatives. The analysis includes a description of existing conditions and an evaluation of changes to geologic conditions, relevant soil properties, and associated elements of land capability and coverage. Regulations and guidelines established by the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) and local jurisdictions, along with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) statute and guidelines, provide the regulatory background that guides the assessment of potential environmental effects on these resources. This section is also based on information provided in the Preliminary Geotechnical Report prepared for the project by Parikh Consultants in 2011 for Wood Rodgers (Parikh Consultants 2011).  Potential environmental effects related to water quality resulting from soil erosion and other stormwater issues are addressed in Section 3.10, “Water Quality and Stormwater Runoff.” Section 3.10 also includes a discussion of excavation in excess of 5 feet as it relates to groundwater interception. Cumulative impacts on geology, soils, land capability and coverage are addressed in Section 3.19, “Cumulative Impacts.”  Comments received on the Notice of Preparation/Notice of Intent related to geology, soils, land capability, and coverage include requests for discussion of land coverage increases and transfers. These topics are discussed in the analysis below.  The project site does not contain expansive soils or slopes that could become unstable or generate landslides or avalanche. Additionally, TRPA regulations prohibit mining and the construction of septic tanks or wastewater disposal systems within the Lake Tahoe Basin. These topics are not discussed further in this document.  3.11.1 Regulatory Setting Regulations protecting the soil resources in the study area are enforced by TRPA, the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) (through water quality regulations), the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection, the City of South Lake Tahoe, and Douglas County in Nevada. Other regulations aid in the establishment of safe structures to ensure minimal, if any, impact on earth resources. The following discussion provides the background for applicable earth resource requirements in the Tahoe Region. This section also discusses geology, soils, and seismic concerns as they relate to public safety and project design. Earthquakes are prime considerations in the design and retrofit of structures. The Department’s Office of Earthquake Engineering is responsible for assessing the seismic hazard for Department projects. Structures are designed using the Department’s Seismic Design Criteria (SDC). The SDC provides the minimum seismic requirements for highway bridges designed in California. A bridge’s category and classification will determine its seismic performance level and which methods are used for estimating the seismic demands and structural capabilities. For more information, please see the Department’s Division of Engineering Services, Office of Earthquake Engineering, Seismic Design Criteria. FEDERAL For geologic and topographic features, the key federal law is the Historic Sites Act of 1935, which establishes a national registry of natural landmarks and protects “outstanding examples of major geological features.” Topographic and geologic features are also protected under the CEQA. National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act was passed to reduce the risks to life and property resulting from earthquakes. To accomplish this, the act established the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP). The mission of NEHRP includes improved understanding, characterization, and prediction of hazards and vulnerabilities; improved building codes and land use practices; risk reduction through post-earthquake investigations and education; development and improvement of design and construction techniques; improved mitigation capacity; and accelerated application of research results. NEHRP designates the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as the lead agency of the program and assigns several planning, coordinating, and reporting responsibilities. Other NEHRP agencies include the National Institute of Standards and Technology, National Science Foundation, and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates water quality in stormwater runoff through implementation of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) (55 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 47990). NPDES permits are intended to address land uses and activities that could create erosion or sediment transportation and potentially degrade water quality. Compliance with these permits requires implementation of erosion control best management practices (BMPs) and preparation of a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) to minimize erosion and sediment transport adjacent to water bodies. In California, EPA has delegated implementation of the NPDES to the State Water Resources Control Board and its nine regional boards. Refer to Section 3.10, “Water Quality and Stormwater Runoff,” for a more detailed discussion. TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities TRPA has established threshold carrying capacity standards and indicators for soil conservation. TRPA threshold standards are minimum standards of environmental quality to be achieved in the Tahoe Region. Every 5 years, TRPA evaluates the attainment status of all TRPA threshold standards. The 2015 Threshold Evaluation was completed in December 2016 (TRPA 2016). TRPA has two soil conservation threshold standard indicator reporting categories:  Land Coverage (impervious cover) Threshold Standard to comply with allowable land coverage limitations established in the Land Capability Classification of the Lake Tahoe Basin. This threshold standard indicator reporting category consists of nine different standards for the nine separate land capability districts (LCDs). All soils within the Tahoe Region have been assigned an LCD based on their ability to tolerate disturbance and development while retaining their natural function. LCDs 1a to 3 are considered sensitive to and LCD 7 is considered the most tolerant of development.   Stream Environment Zone (SEZ) Threshold Standard to restore 25 percent of the SEZ lands that have been identified as disturbed, developed or subdivided to attain a 5 percent increase in the area of naturally functioning SEZ lands. LCD 1b comprises SEZ lands. The 2015 status of the Tahoe Region’s soil conservation threshold standards is considerably better than the target for LCDs 1a and 3 through 6; somewhat better than the target for LCDs 1c and 7; and considerably worse than the target for LCD 1b. The 2015 status of the SEZ restoration threshold is considerably worse than the target. Lake Tahoe Regional Plan Several components of the Lake Tahoe Regional Plan address policies and regulations pertaining to geology, soils, land capability, and coverage: Goals and Policies, Code of Ordinances, and Water Quality Management Plan (TRPA 2012). Goals and Policies Goals and policies applicable to geology, soils, land capability, and coverage are included in several elements and subelements of the Goals and Policies document of the Regional Plan. The Natural Hazards Subelement of the Land Use Element addresses risks from natural hazards (e.g., flood, fire, avalanche, and earthquake). Specifically, Goal 1, Policy LU-2 prohibits new construction on, or disturbance of land within the 100-year floodplain and in the area of wave run-up except as necessary to implement the goals and policies of the Plan; and requires all public utilities, transportation facilities, and other necessary public uses located in the 100-year floodplain and area of wave run-up to be constructed or maintained to prevent damage from flooding and to not cause flooding. The Water Quality Subelement of the Land Use Element includes goals to reduce loads of sediment and algal nutrients to Lake Tahoe (Goal WQ-3); meet sediment and nutrient objectives for tributary streams, surface runoff, and subsurface runoff (Policy WQ-3.1); restore 80 percent of the disturbed lands relative to the 1983 baseline (Policy WQ-3.2); and specifies that the implementation of BMPs shall be required as a condition of approval for all projects (Policy WQ-3.12). The Soils Subelement of the Conservation Element addresses soil erosion and loss of soil productivity through policies pertaining to coverage, including allowable coverage for categories of land uses in specific LCDs (Policies S-1.1 and S-1.2). This subelement also addresses special regulations regarding construction and soil-disturbing activities occurring between October 15 and May 1 (Policy S-1.6) and restoration of disturbed areas in SEZs (Policy S-1.7). The full text of these goals and policies, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with the goals and policies, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.” Code of Ordinances The TRPA Code of Ordinances implements the Regional Plan Goals and Policies. The following TRPA Code provisions are most relevant to the geology, soils, land capability, and coverage aspects of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project. Chapter 30 – Land Coverage Standards Since the late 1970s, TRPA has used the land capability classification system known as the Bailey System (Bailey 1974) to guide land use planning, policy formulation related to the impacts of development on soil erosion, and permitting of development. The Bailey System was developed as a threat assessment and planning tool to identify and mitigate adverse impacts on water quality and stream systems that occur from surface runoff and erosion related to development. The Bailey System is the basis of the land coverage standards and limitations set forth in Chapter 30 of the TRPA Code.  Coverage is defined by TRPA as a human-built structure or other impervious surface that prevents normal precipitation from directly reaching the surface of the land underlying the structure, therefore precluding or slowing the natural infiltration of water into the soil (Code Chapter 90). TRPA further defines coverage as impervious surface (hard coverage) or compacted soil (soft coverage). Research has established the connection between impervious surfaces and water quality. Specifically, coverage may affect water quality as it reduces the amount of soil available to infiltrate water and has the potential to result in surface runoff, erosion, and delivery of pollutants to receiving waters.  The Bailey System assigns LCDs based primarily on soil characteristics and slope. The LCDs reflect the amount of development that a given site can support without experiencing soil or water quality degradation. The LCDs range from 1 to 7, with 1 being the most environmentally sensitive and 7 being most suitable for supporting development (Table 3.11-1). Under this system, TRPA allows landowners to cover 1, 5, 20, 25, or 30 percent of their parcel with impervious surfaces, depending on its environmental sensitivity as defined by the Bailey classification system.  For parcels of up to 20 acres, parcel size is used to determine the amount of allowable coverage for a project site. As described in Code Section 30.4.1.C.3.b.i, however, highways, streets, roads, and the easements or rights-of-way allowing potential land coverage for linear public facilities, highways streets, and roads are not included within a project site.  Table 3.11-1 Land Capability Districts for Lake Tahoe Region  Capability Levels  Tolerance for Use  Slope Percent  Relative Erosion Potential  Runoff Potential  Disturbance Hazards  7  Most  0-5  Slight  Low to moderately low  Low hazard  6  0-16  5  0-16  Moderately high to high  4  9-30  Moderate  Low to moderately low  Moderate hazard lands  3  9-30  Moderately high to high  2  30-50  High  Low to moderately low  High hazard lands  1a  Least  30+  Moderately high to high  1b  (Poor Natural Drainage)  1c  (Fragile Flora and Fauna)  Source: Bailey 1974  Exemption from Land Coverage Calculations for Non-Motorized Trails Section 30.4.6.D.3 of the TRPA Code provides an exemption from land coverage calculations for non-motorized public trails. To qualify for this exemption, the non-motorized trail must be a component of the trail network identified in the Lake Tahoe Region Bike Trail and Pedestrian Plan; open to the public in perpetuity, at no cost; be routed to minimize disturbance of sensitive land and removal of large trees and riparian vegetation; meet industry standard engineering criteria; provide elevated stream crossings; incorporate appropriate BMPs; and minimize disturbance to sensitive wildlife habitat.  Exceptions to Prohibition in Land Capability District 1b (Stream Environment Zone)  Section 30.5 of the TRPA Code prohibits additional land coverage in low capability LCDs unless the project meets certain exceptions. The following exception applies to the prohibition of land coverage and disturbance in LCD 1b (Stream Environment Zone):  C. Public Service Facilities Land coverage and disturbance for public service facilities may be permitted in LCD 1b (Stream Environment Zone) if TRPA finds that:  1. The project is necessary for public health, safety, or environmental protection;  2. There is no reasonable alternative, including a bridge span or relocation, that avoids or reduces the extent of encroachment in the stream environment zone; and 3. The impacts of the land coverage and disturbance are fully mitigated through application of BMPs and restoration in accordance with Section 30.5.3 in the amount of 1.5 times the area of SEZ land covered or disturbed by the project. Linear Public Facilities (LPFs) are a sub-category of the TRPA-defined Public Service Facilities. The allowable land coverage permitted for an LPF is limited to the minimum amount needed to achieve its public purpose (TRPA Code Section 30.4.2.D). If an LPF requires more land coverage than allowed by Table 4.5-2 [in Section 30.5 of the TRPA Code], the additional coverage may be purchased from a land coverage bank, or transferred from another parcel. In order to qualify for this special consideration, the LPF must be necessary (per TRPA Code Section 50.8.1), minimize the amount of new coverage, and be operated by a public agency, and must demonstrate that there are no feasible alternatives.  Chapter 60 – Water Quality Chapter 60 of the TRPA Code sets forth requirements for installation of BMPs for the protection or restoration of water quality and attainment of minimum discharge standards. Projects shall comply with temporary and permanent BMP programs as a condition of project approval. Chapter 33 – Grading and Construction Chapter 33 of the TRPA Code describes the various standards and regulations that protect the environment against significant adverse effects from excavation, filling, and clearing, resulting from such conditions as exposed soils, unstable earthworks, or groundwater interference. Tourist Core Area Plan The City of South Lake Tahoe, in conjunction with and approval from TRPA, adopted the Tourist Core Area Plan (TCAP) on October 15, 2013, which largely replaced the Stateline/Ski Run Community Plan of 1994. The tourist core stretches approximately 2 miles along US 50 from Fairway Drive to the California/Nevada state line and along Ski Run Boulevard from Lake Tahoe to Pioneer Trail. This area functions as the primary visitor and tourist district in South Lake Tahoe and provides direct access to recreation opportunities such as Heavenly Ski Resort, Edgewood Golf Course, Ski Run Marina, Lakeside Marina, and Van Sickle Bi-State Park.  TCAP goals and policies for soil and geologic resources that are applicable to the project are found in the Natural and Cultural Resources section. Water quality policies include a requirement for installation of BMPs on all projects identified in the MOU between TRPA and the City of South Lake Tahoe (Policy NCR-3.1). Land coverage policies address reduction of onsite land coverage through environmental redevelopment (Policy NCR-4.1); opportunities for coverage reduction (Policy NCR-4.2); landscaping features in all private and public redevelopment projects (Policy NCR-4.3); and transferring hard coverage from SEZs and other sensitive lands to high capability lands (Policy NCR-4.4). The full text of these goals and policies, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with the goals and policies, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.” South Shore Area Plan Douglas County, in conjunction with and with approval from TRPA, prepared and approved the South Shore Area Plan (SSAP) on November 21, 2013. The SSAP replaced the Stateline Community Plan; Kingsbury Community Plan; a portion of Plan Area Statement 070A (Edgewood), including Special Area #1 (C-070A SA1); and a portion of Plan Area Statement 080 (Kingsbury Drainage), including Special Area #2 (R-080 SA2). The SSAP has been developed to build upon the concepts in the South Shore Vision Plan, as well as be consistent with the goals and policies in the 2012 TRPA Regional Plan. The SSAP includes four separate components that are integrated into Douglas County planning documents: the Douglas County Master Plan, Zoning Map, Development Code, and Design Criteria and Improvement Standards.  STATE California National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permits and Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans In California, the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) administers the federal NPDES for EPA. In turn, the SWRCB’s jurisdiction is administered through nine regional water quality control boards, which provide region-specific water quality standards and control measures to implement the federal Clean Water Act (see discussion in Section 3.10, “Water Quality and Stormwater Runoff”). The Lahontan RWQCB is responsible for regulating surface water and groundwater quality within the Tahoe Basin, including the project site. The Water Quality Control Plan for the Lahontan Region (Lahontan RWQCB 2015) establishes water quality objectives enforced through federal NPDES permits.   Under these federal regulations, an operator must obtain a General Permit through the NPDES Stormwater Program for all construction activities with ground disturbance of 1 acre or more. The General Permit requires the implementation of BMPs to control erosion and reduce sedimentation into surface waters. One element of compliance with the NPDES permit is preparation of a SWPPP that addresses prevention and control of water pollution, including sediment, in runoff during construction. (See Section 3.10, “Water Quality and Stormwater Runoff,” for more information about the NPDES permit process and SWPPPs.) Lake Tahoe Water Quality Management Plan (208 Plan) The Lake Tahoe Water Quality Management Plan (also known as the 208 Plan, in reference to the pertinent section of the Clean Water Act) is a framework that sets forth the components of the water quality management system in the Lake Tahoe Region, the desired water quality outcomes for the Tahoe Basin, and the mechanisms adopted by the relevant entities to achieve and maintain those outcomes. The agencies with primary responsibility for regulatory oversight of water quality in the Basin is the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board and the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection; other entities with regulatory responsibility for aspects of water quality are TRPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Best Management Practices Handbook (TRPA 2014a) provides technical guidance and assistance to engineers, architects, consultants, builders, homeowners, and other agencies proposing a project in the Tahoe Basin that may affect water quality. It identifies and recommends BMPs for various situations. Elements of the 208 Plan relevant to geology, soils, land capability, and coverage are as follows:  Best management practices: Use of BMPs is mandatory for all new development; BMPs must be retrofitted for existing development and are required for resource management uses (e.g., timber harvest, livestock grazing).   Land coverage restrictions: The land capability system limits the amount of allowable impervious surface coverage, especially on lands with high erosion hazard and in SEZs. Limited exceptions for public projects, coverage transfer, and coverage relocation are provided in Code of Ordinances Chapter 30.  Roads and rights-of-way: The Lahontan RWQCB requires controls for potential erosion from new and existing roads, road maintenance activities, and snow and ice control. California Tahoe Conservancy The mission of the California Tahoe Conservancy (Conservancy) is to preserve, protect, restore, enhance, and sustain the unique and significant natural resources and recreational opportunities of the Lake Tahoe Region (7.42 California Government Code, Sections 66905–66908.3). The Conservancy’s jurisdiction extends throughout the California side of the Tahoe Region, as defined in California Government Code Section 66905.5. In 1987, the Conservancy authorized staff to develop and implement a land coverage (land bank) program. Through this program, the Conservancy acquires properties eligible for purchase from willing sellers. The development potential on these properties is then retired. All rights and credits acquired by the Conservancy are stored in a land bank. Through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with TRPA, the Conservancy is authorized to receive disbursements of TRPA excess coverage mitigation fees to perform coverage reduction through its land bank (TRPA and Conservancy 1988). The MOU also authorizes the Conservancy to sell coverage rights on the open market and conduct SEZ restoration or mitigation for private or public service projects through the land bank.  The benefits of the Conservancy’s land coverage program include acquisition and restoration of developed areas that have become degraded and that contribute, or have the potential to contribute, to water quality problems; protection of undeveloped land before development activities generate the need for mitigation; ongoing management to ensure that resource benefits are sustained; assistance to property owners in complying with regional land coverage policies so they may construct or rehabilitate homes and businesses; and actions to simplify and expedite public and private projects. In the study area, the Conservancy owns and manages the California portion of the Van Sickle Bi-State Park. In accordance with an MOU with Nevada Division of State Parks, the Conservancy manages the property for its recreational, cultural, and natural resource values, including soil conservation.  Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act (Alquist-Priolo Act) (Public Resources Code Sections 2621–2630) was passed in 1972 to mitigate the hazard of surface faulting to structures designed for human occupancy. The main purpose of the law is to prevent the construction of buildings used for human occupancy on the surface trace (the intersection of a fault with the ground surface) of active faults. The law addresses only the hazard of surface fault rupture and is not directed toward other earthquake hazards. The Alquist-Priolo Act requires the State Geologist to establish regulatory zones known as Earthquake Fault Zones around the surface traces of active faults and to issue appropriate maps. The maps are distributed to all affected cities, counties, and state agencies for their use in planning efforts. Before a project can be permitted in a designated Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone, cities and counties must require a geologic investigation to demonstrate that proposed buildings would not be constructed across active faults. Seismic Hazards Mapping Act The Seismic Hazards Mapping Act of 1990 (Public Resources Code Sections 2690–2699.6) addresses earthquake hazards from nonsurface fault rupture, including liquefaction and seismically induced landslides. The act established a mapping program for areas that have the potential for liquefaction, landslide, strong ground shaking, or other earthquake and geologic hazards. The act also specifies that the lead agency for a project may withhold development permits until geologic or soils investigations are conducted for specific sites and mitigation measures are incorporated into plans to reduce hazards associated with seismicity and unstable soils. California Building Standards Code The State of California provides minimum standards for building design through the California Building Standards Code (California Code of Regulations, Title 24). The California Building Code (CBC) applies to building design and construction in the state and is based on the International Building Code used widely throughout the country (generally adopted on a state-by-state or district-by-district basis). In the CBC, the International Building Code has been modified for California conditions with more detailed and/or more stringent regulations. The state earthquake protection law (California Health and Safety Code Section 19100 et seq.) requires that structures be designed to resist stresses produced by lateral forces caused by wind and earthquakes. Specific minimum seismic safety and structural design requirements are set forth in Chapter 16 of the CBC. The CBC identifies seismic factors that must be considered in structural design. Chapter 18 of the CBC regulates the excavation of foundations and retaining walls, and Chapter 33 regulates grading activities, including drainage and erosion control and construction on unstable soils, such as expansive soils and areas subject to liquefaction. Nevada Nevada Division of Environmental Protection The Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP), Bureau of Water Quality Planning administers the NPDES program authorized by the federal Clean Water Act within the state of Nevada. All projects disturbing more than 1 acre of land must obtain a NPDES General Permit for stormwater discharge associated with construction activity. As described above, NPDES permits are intended to address land uses and activities that could create erosion or sediment transportation and potentially degrade water quality. Refer to Section 3.10, “Water Quality and Stormwater Runoff,” for a more detailed discussion.  Nevada Division of State Lands The Nevada Division of State Lands (NDSL) leads the state’s programs to protect Lake Tahoe. NDSL administers the excess coverage mitigation program for the Nevada portion of the Lake Tahoe Region, which is funded by excess coverage mitigation fees disbursed from TRPA. The objective of this program is to improve the water quality of Lake Tahoe through the retirement of land coverage and restoration of disturbed lands. This program acquires land and land coverage. Acquired lands are protected and are not available for development or disposal. Management goals include clean water, healthy forests, the reduction of excess fire fuels and hazardous forest conditions, good wildlife habitat, and reasonable public access. LOCAL Area Plans The Tourist Core Area Plan and the South Shore Area Plan are joint planning documents prepared by the local jurisdictions, City of South Lake Tahoe and Douglas County, and TRPA. The goals and policies of these plans are discussed above under “Tahoe Regional Planning Agency.”  City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan The City of South Lake Tahoe adopted the 2030 General Plan on May 17, 2011. The 2030 General Plan is the City’s policy document containing elements that guide land use, transportation, public facilities and services, recreation, natural resources, and other decisions in compliance with the TRPA Regional Plan. The Health and Safety Element of the General Plan contains goals and policies applicable to the build alternatives, including a requirement buildings and structures in the City are constructed to withstand seismically-induced ground shaking and related geologic hazards (Policy HS-3.1). The full text of these goals and policies, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with the goals and policies, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.” South Lake Tahoe City Code The South Lake Tahoe City Code requires the submission of engineered plans for all large projects (Section 7.20.280). The required components of engineered plans are described in Section 7.20.290 and include a detailed erosion and sediment control plan showing the specific locations, construction details, and supporting calculations for temporary and permanent structural BMPs and facilities; a revegetation plan describing temporary and permanent erosion control plantings, groundcovers, and irrigation facilities; a drainage study; and a geotechnical investigation report providing recommendations addressing the proposed work. Geotechnical investigations are required when the proposed grading exceeds 10 feet in depth at any point, when highly expansive soils are present, and in areas of known or suspected geological hazards. All projects must meet the minimum standards provided in the City of South Lake Tahoe Public Improvement and Engineering Standards.  Douglas County Master Plan The 15-year update of the Douglas County Master Plan was adopted on March 1, 2012. This updated included the adoption of the SSAP, which incorporated the relevant updates from the 2012 TRPA Regional Plan into the Douglas County Code and Douglas County Master Plan. The Douglas County Master Plan contains several elements that detail goals, policies, and actions for future development within Douglas County, Nevada. The Environmental Resources and Conservation Element of the Master Plan describes the concerns related to the natural environment in Douglas County and measures needed to protect these resources as well as to protect public health and safety. The County has established goals to minimize danger and damage to county residents from geologic hazards (ERC Goal 1) and to protect future residents from safety hazards (ERC Goal 2). The full text of these goals, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with them, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.” Douglas County Building and Development Ordinances  Douglas County Consolidated Development Code Title 20, Chapter 20.690, “Property Development Standards,” contains provisions related to grading activities in hillside areas with slopes of 15 percent or greater and having a minimum vertical rise of at least 30 feet. Chapter 20.690, Section K(4) requires that a slope analysis and a grading plan, prepared by a Nevada registered professional engineer, be submitted to the Community Development Department for review and approval. The grading plan must include data on proposed slopes, drainage patterns, storm water detention, and cross-section exhibits showing preliminary cut-and-fill areas. An applicant must also submit an erosion control and re-vegetation plan prepared by a Nevada licensed landscape architect, registered forester, or civil engineer. Chapter 20.690, Section K(6) sets forth Douglas County grading standards that apply in hillside areas.  3.11.2 Affected Environment GEOLOGY AND TOPOGRAPHY Regional Geology The study area is located in the Sierra Nevada geomorphic province. The Sierra Nevada mountain range is a tilted fault block with a gentle western slope and a steep, rugged eastern escarpment. It runs through eastern California and a small portion of western Nevada, from the Mojave Desert in the south to the Cascade Range and Modoc Plateau on the north, for more than 400 miles and averages 50 to 80 miles wide. The Sierra Nevada geomorphic province is primarily composed of massive granitic bedrock, remnants of metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks (volcanic and sedimentary rocks subsequently subjected to substantial heat and pressure), and more recent volcanic and sedimentary rocks. It is bounded on the west by sedimentary rocks of the Great Valley geomorphic province and on the north by volcanic sheets extending south from the Cascade Range (California Department of Conservation, California Geological Survey [CGS] 2002). The Lake Tahoe Basin is located in the northern Sierra Nevada, between the Sierra crest to the west and the Carson Range to the east, and is one of the most prominent mountain ranges in California. Faulting and volcanism created the Lake Tahoe Basin over 2 million years ago, and as a result, the Basin contains granitic, metamorphic, and volcanic rock (Saucedo 2005). The bedrock in the Tahoe Basin is predominantly Cretaceous granodiorite of the Sierra Nevada batholith. Cretaceous rock formed during the later period of the Mesozoic Era, characterized by the development of flowering plants and ending with the sudden extinction of the dinosaurs and many other forms of life. Pre-Cretaceous metamorphic rocks are found in localized areas. Over the past 1.5 million years, the Lake Tahoe Region has been altered by glacial activity, and most of the landforms surrounding the Lake are a result of glaciation. During glacial activities, valley glaciers dammed the Truckee River Canyon, raising the water level of Lake Tahoe. Lacustrine sediments (those formed at the bottom of lakes) were deposited in the bays and canyons around the Lake as a result of rising water levels. The faulting, folding, and (in some cases) overturning of rock formations that has taken place during various periods of geologic activity, in combination with erosion, deposition, and subsequent cementation of rock materials that occurred during relatively quiet periods, have left a complex arrangement of geologic rock types and structures in the area. The extraordinary clarity of Lake Tahoe is related to the prevalence of resistant granitic bedrock in the Lake Tahoe Basin and the unusually small drainage basin relative to the size of Lake Tahoe. A review of the Geologic Map of the Lake Tahoe Basin (Saucedo 2005) indicates that there is a strong geologic split between the east and west sides of the project site. The eastern side of the project site is located on Cretaceous-era (145–65 million years ago) granodiorite rock, specifically the East Peak (Keg) and Bryan Meadows (Kbmg) granodiorite. Near the resort-casinos the geology shifts to Pleistocene-era (1.8 million–10,000 years ago) Lacustrine terrace deposits (Qlt), which continue westward until reaching more recent beach deposits along the shore of Lake Tahoe.  Site Topography Slope of the land is an important consideration in development planning. Slopes, in conjunction with soil types, geological and seismic hazards, and scenic vistas, are potential limitations to development. Typically, challenges associated with development on slight slopes are minimal. Development on steep slopes, hillsides, and ridgelines has greater potential for erosion problems, has lower rates of revegetation, can degrade the aesthetic value of the natural environment, and can represent hazards to the land itself. The project site is located on the South Lake Tahoe 7.5-minute USGS quadrangle map. The project site is located on gently sloping terrain between the foot of East Peak and the shore of Lake Tahoe. Elevations range from 6,400 feet in the areas around Van Sickle Bi-State Park to 6,240 feet west of the tourist core.  Seismicity An earthquake is classified by the amount of energy released, which traditionally has been quantified using the Richter scale. Recently, seismologists have begun using a moment magnitude (M) scale because it provides a more accurate measurement of the size of large earthquakes. For earthquakes of less than M 7.0, the moment and Richter magnitude scales are nearly identical. For earthquakes greater than M 7.0, readings on the moment magnitude scale are slightly higher than the corresponding Richter magnitude.  The intensity of seismic shaking, or strong ground motion, during an earthquake is dependent on the distance and direction from the epicenter of the earthquake, the magnitude of the earthquake, and the geologic conditions of the surrounding area. Ground shaking may result in damage to or collapse of buildings and other structures. Most earthquakes occur along faults, which are fractures or geological areas of weakness, with rocks on one side being displaced with respect to those on the other side. Most faults are the result of repeated displacement that may have taken place suddenly and/or by slow creep (Bryant and Hart 2007:3). Faulting was a key element in the formation of Lake Tahoe. The Lake Tahoe Basin lies in a graben (a trench between two faults) between the Sierra Nevada and the Carson Range (as shown in Exhibit 3.11-1). The outlet of the Basin was repeatedly dammed by volcanic eruptions and glacial ice dams (Schweickert et al. 2000). The nature of the seismic hazard in the Lake Tahoe Region was not appreciated for many years because the active faults within the Lake Tahoe Basin are covered by the lake itself. The portions of the Basin faults that show the greatest activity and strain are underwater, with activity diminishing as they move on-shore (Seitz and Kent 2004). Additionally, recent work analyzing sediment cores from the bottom of Lake Tahoe show that local earthquakes trigger landslides in the Lake (Seitz 2013). It is likely that many of the landslides evident with the Lake Tahoe Basin (including the ancient, catastrophic, five-mile wide landslide that formed McKinney Bay) were triggered by earthquakes (Dingler 2007).   Source: Schweickert et al. 2000 Exhibit 3.11-1 Model of Lake Tahoe Basin Half-Graben    The California State Mining and Geology Board defines an active fault as one that has had surface displacement within the last 11,000 years (CGS 2008) (Table 3.11-2). Three active faults occur within the Basin (Table 3.11-2): The West Tahoe–Dollar Point Fault (the longest, at 45 kilometers), the Stateline–North Tahoe Fault, and the Incline Village Fault (Brothers et al. 2009). Recent studies indicate that all three of these faults have experienced large rupture events within recent geologic time (Dingler 2007, Seitz and Kent 2004). Of the three faults, the West Tahoe–Dollar Point Fault has the fastest slip rate (the rate at which two faults pass each other or build tension), and its most recent confirmed rupture event was approximately 4,000 years ago (Brothers et al. 2009). The high slip rate, the height of scarps (earthquake-generated breaks in ground surface), and the length of time since the last event indicate that the West Tahoe–Dollar Point Fault could generate an earthquake with a magnitude greater than seven (Brothers et al. 2009). The height of scarps along the Incline Village Fault show that this fault has experienced several M 7.0 events and that it last ruptured approximately 575 years ago (Schweickert et al. 2000, Seitz et al. 2005). The short length of the Incline Village Fault in comparison to its large scarps indicates that it may rupture in coordination with other faults, potentially the Stateline–North Tahoe Fault to the west. In addition, the dates of the most recent event on both the Incline Village Fault and the Genoa Fault (just outside of the Basin in the Carson Valley) are the same or nearly identical (Seitz et al. 2005).  East of the Region, the Carson Range fault system, one of the Region’s largest, runs for 60 miles along the east face of the Carson Range from Reno to Markleeville. The probability of at least one event at or greater than M 6.0 occurring in the Reno–Carson City urban corridor over a 50-year period is estimated to be 34–98 percent, the probability of an event at or greater than M 6.6 is estimated to be 9–64 percent, and the probability of an event at or greater than M 7.0 is estimated to be 4–50 percent. These probabilities are relatively high and are commensurate with estimates in many parts of California (dePolo et al. 1997:3).  The nearest mapped Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone is located in the Minden-Gardnerville area of Nevada, approximately 7 miles southeast of the project site (CGS 2010). Table 3.11-2 Earthquake Faults and Fault Zones Near the Project Site  Fault/Fault Zone  Location and Distance from Project Site  Type and Hazard  Tahoe Valley Fault Zone  Less than 1 mile southwest of the project site   Potentially active  Genoa Fault  Approximately 7 miles east/southeast of the site  Active—east-dipping, normal fault capable of producing a magnitude greater than 7.0  Tahoe-Sierra Frontal Fault Zone  Approximately 8 miles west of the project site  Active—may produce earthquakes of magnitudes between 6.3 and 6.9  West Tahoe–Dollar Point Fault  The southernmost extension of the fault passes approximately 10 miles west of the project site  Active—included in the Western Nevada Zone; comparable to the Genoa Fault, capable of producing earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 7.0  Incline Village Fault  Approximately 15 miles north of the project site  Active—capable of producing earthquakes of magnitude 6.9; may rupture in tandem with the North Tahoe fault  North Tahoe Fault  Approximately 15 miles north of the project site  Active  Agate Bay Fault  Approximately 15 miles northwest of the project site  Potentially active  Antelope Valley Fault Zone  Near Topaz Lake, approximately 30 miles southeast of the project site  Active  Source: CGS 2015  Ground Failure and Liquefaction Soil liquefaction occurs when ground shaking from an earthquake causes a sediment layer saturated with groundwater to lose strength and take on the characteristics of a fluid. Factors determining liquefaction potential are soil type, level and duration of seismic ground motion, type and consistency of soils, and depth to groundwater. Loose sands and peat deposits are susceptible to liquefaction, while clayey silts, silty clays, and clays deposited in freshwater environments are generally stable under the influence of seismic ground shaking (CGS 2008:35 - 37).  Liquefaction poses a hazard to engineered structures. The loss of soil strength can result in bearing capacity insufficient to support foundation loads, increased lateral pressure on retaining or basement walls, and slope instability. Sites underlain by relatively loose, sandy soils and saturated deposits of fill combined with a shallow groundwater table, which typically are located in alluvial river valleys/basins and floodplains, are susceptible to liquefaction.  The project site is situated on silts, sands, and gravels that could be at risk of liquefaction, if they were saturated with water; however, monitoring wells within the tourist core area indicate that the depth to groundwater is typically between 20 and 34 feet (Parikh Consultants 2011). Because of this, liquefaction potential in the shallow depths of the project site is low.  Tsunami and Seiche A tsunami is a wave or series of waves that may result from a major seismic event that involved the displacement of a large volume of water (such as rupture of a major fault), and may occur in any large body of water. A seiche is a periodic oscillation of an enclosed or restricted water body, typically a lake or reservoir, produced by seismic shaking. The action of a seiche is similar to the sloshing of a bathtub, with waves bouncing back and forth across the water body. Seiche waves can continue for hours following a tsunami inducing earthquake, causing extensive damage. Modeling of potential earthquakes occurring beneath Lake Tahoe indicate that a fault rupturing seismic event of magnitude 7.0 could trigger a tsunami, followed by seiche with waves of up to 30 feet high along the shoreline of Lake Tahoe (Ichinose et al. 2000). Exhibit 3.11-2 shows the land area within 30 vertical feet of the Lake Tahoe high water elevation. Soils The soil of the project site can be categorized into three broad groups: soils of mountain toe-slopes (Cassesnai gravelly loamy coarse sand); soils formed in ancient beach terraces (Christopher–Gefo complex, Jabu coarse sandy loam, Marla loamy coarse sand, and Oneidas coarse sandy loam); and soils found in the floodplains of streams (Tahoe complex). Exhibit 3.11-3 shows the extent of each soil map unit within the project site limits; general soil characteristics are described below (Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2007). Cassenai gravelly loamy coarse sand, 5 to 15 percent slopes, very stony: The Cassenai gravelly loamy coarse sand makes up approximately 16 acres or 13 percent of the project site. These soils formed in granitic colluvium (material moved downhill by gravity) and are found on mountain slopes. Typical vegetation consists of Jeffrey pine and white fir forest with scattered openings of greenleaf manzanita and mountain whitethorn. These soils are somewhat excessively drained with moderately rapid permeability, and the surface runoff class is “low.” Christopher–Gefo complex, 0 to 5 percent slopes: The Christopher–Gefo complex makes up 48 acres of the project site, or approximately 37 percent. This map unit is composed of two very similar soils that formed in sandy granitic outwash deposited by streams near Lake Tahoe. The soil profile is essentially a loamy sand that has been altered and stabilized by vegetation growth over time. Vegetation consists of Jeffrey pine and white fir forest with an understory of greenleaf manzanita, mahala mat, and mountain whitethorn. These soils are somewhat excessively drained with rapid permeability and a surface runoff class of “very low.” Jabu coarse sandy loam, 0 to 9 percent slopes: The Jabu coarse sandy loam makes up 6.5 acres (5 percent) of the project site. The Jabu soil is similar to the Christopher and Gefo soils, except that it is more shallow, containing a restrictive layer between 39 and 79 inches and bedrock between 59 and 79 inches. Vegetation consists of Jeffrey pine and white fir forest with an understory of greenleaf manzanita, mahala mat, and mountain whitethorn. The Jabu soil is well drained but has very slow permeability in the restrictive layer. The surface runoff class is “low.”    Exhibit 3.11-2 Seiche Range within the Project Site     Exhibit 3.11-3 Project Site Soils    Marla loamy coarse sand, 0 to 5 percent slopes: The Marla loamy coarse sand makes up approximately 6 acres (5 percent) of the project site. This is an alluvial soil derived from granodiorite and is found on outwash terraces and valley flats. Vegetation consists of lodgepole pine forest with scattered white fir and Jeffrey pine. Willows, grasses, and forbs make up the understory. These soils are poorly drained because of the presence of a high water table and a clay layer between 47 to 59 inches, which slows permeability. The surface runoff class is “very high.” Oneidas coarse sandy loam: The Oneidas coarse sandy loam makes up approximately 17 acres (15 percent) of the project site. Of this area, 8 acres are on 0 to 5 percent slopes and 11 acres are on 5 to 15 percent slopes. The Oneidas soil is found on outwash terraces. Although it is coarse textured, it contains a restrictive layer beginning near a depth of 10 inches that slows water movement through the soil. The Oneidas soils are considered poorly drained, with slow permeability and a runoff class of “very high.” The land capability verification for the Edgewood mountain parcel that borders the project site (APNs 1318-27-001-006, 1318-27-001-005, and 1318-00-002-006) found that the soils mapped as Oneidas did not have the restrictive layer indicated by the 2007 NRCS soil survey (TRPA 2014b). The presence or absence of the restrictive layer in the soils mapped as Oneidas within the remainder of the project site would be determined by the land capability verification completed before TRPA permit approval.  Tahoe complex, 0 to 2 percent slopes: The Tahoe Complex covers approximately 7 acres (6 percent) of the project site. This soil complex formed in stream and river deposits washed down from granitic and volcanic rock. It consists of small areas of recent alluvium adjacent to stream channels and in meadows. It is nearly level to gently sloping, and typical vegetation consists of sedges, meadow grasses, and scattered lodgepole pines. This mapping unit is made up of a “dry” and a “wet” variant. The “wet” soils have a high water table and some may be classified as hydric soils. These soils are poorly drained and have moderate permeability, and the surface runoff class is “low.”  Urban Land: Urban lands cover 27 acres (21 percent) of the project site. These are highly altered landscapes where most of the soil surface is covered by urban development or decorative landscaping. Most of the urban lands beneath the Heavenly Village Center and extending from the California/Nevada state line to the midline of the parcel currently occupied by the Hard Rock resort casino (APN 1318-27-001-009) are underlain by imported fill (Saucedo 2005). This area was the historic floodplain of Golf Course and Stateline Creeks.  Erosion Potential and Hazard Rating Erosion is the process by which surface soils are detached and transported by water and/or wind. Erosion has a detrimental effect on soil productivity, because erosion begins with the upper horizons of a soil profile, which contain organic matter and microbial communities vital to supporting plant growth. Soil erosion is also an important concern in the Tahoe Region, because it can contribute sediment to the lake, including fine sediment, potentially affecting lake clarity. Factors that influence the erosion potential of a soil include vegetative cover; soil properties such as soil texture, structure, rock fragments, and depth; steepness and slope length; and climatic factors such as the amount and intensity of precipitation.  The NRCS soil surveys provide a rating of erosion hazard resulting from disturbance of non-road areas. This rating is based on slope and soil erosion factor (K). The predicted soil loss is caused by sheet or rill erosion (which occurs when shallow flows of water causing sheet erosion coalesce into rills, increasing in velocity and scouring capacity) in off-road or off-trail areas where 50 to 75 percent of the surface has been exposed by some kind of disturbance. The soils of the project site have an erosion hazard rating of “slight,” which indicates that erosion is unlikely under ordinary conditions. Compaction Potential Soil compaction refers to an increase in soil density or a loss of pore space. Soil pores provide storage space for the oxygen and water needed to facilitate biological activity within the soil. Compaction reduces soil productivity and hydrologic function because compacted soils resist water absorption, restrict air movement around roots, and create a physical barrier to root development. All soils are more vulnerable to compaction when they are wet; however, fine-textured, poorly-drained soils with little organic matter are the most susceptible. The Tahoe complex soil map unit contains fine-textured soils with poor drainage and makes up approximately 7 acres of the project site. These soils could be susceptible to compaction.  LAND CAPABILITY AND COVERAGE Since the late 1970s, TRPA has used a land capability classification system based on the ability of areas of soil to tolerate use without resulting in environmental damage (Bailey 1974). As explained in “Regulatory Setting” above, this system assigns LCDs to sites based primarily on soil characteristics and slope. The LCDs reflect the amount of development each site can support without experiencing soil or water quality degradation. The LCDs range from 1 to 7, with 1 being the most environmentally sensitive and 7 being most suitable for supporting development. LCD 1b is applied to land that is influenced by surface water or high groundwater and is also referred to as “Stream Environment Zone” or SEZ. The amount of compacted or impervious surface, known as coverage, allowed with a given parcel is limited by its LCD.  The 1974 Bailey Land Capability map is used as TRPA’s basis for determining LCDs; however, because this map was created for use at a landscape scale, verification of LCDs for each build alternative would be required before TRPA permit acknowledgement. Although portions of the project site have been reviewed through the Land Capability Verification process for other (unrelated) projects, a verification has not been completed for the project site as a whole. For the purposes of this analysis, LCDs were determined using verified land capability maps where available, and by using a combination of the Bailey LCD map and project-level vegetation mapping for unverified areas. The use of vegetation mapping completed for the project allows for improved accuracy in defining SEZ margins and inclusion of some small SEZ areas that were not shown on the landscape-scale Bailey mapping. Exhibit 3.11-4 shows the mapped extent of each LCD within the project site limits.  The project site is located in and around an urban center (i.e., the tourist core area) and, as such, contains a large amount of land coverage resulting from previous urban development and necessary infrastructure. As shown in Table 3.11-3, the portions of the project site within LCDs 1b, 3, and 7 currently exceed their coverage limits. Because the tourist core and resort-casinos were developed before the establishment of TRPA, it is likely that some of this coverage (especially in LCD 7) is legally existing, excess coverage.  Table 3.11-3 Project Site Land Capability and Coverage – Existing Conditions  LCD  Acres  Allowable Coverage1  Maximum Allowable Coverage (Acres)  Existing Coverage (Acres)  Coverage Balance (Acres; + = Exceedance)  1a  1.27  1%  0.01  0.01  0  1b  9.82  1%  0.10  3.18  +3.09  2  0.74  1%  0.09  0  - 0.04  3  7.19  5%  0.04  2.85  +2.49  4  7.40  20%/70%  0.36  2.51  - 0.35  5  31.77  25%/70%  2.87  11.39  - 1.79  6  1.69  30%/70%  13.19  0.09  - 0.42  7  71.25  30%/70%  0.52  44.53  +2.02  1 Approximately 75 acres of the project site is located within a Regional or Town Center.

The information obtained from these sources was reviewed and summarized to understand existing conditions and to identify potential environmental effects, based on the thresholds of significance. In determining the level of significance, the analysis assumes that the project would comply with relevant federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and ordinances.  SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA NEPA Criteria The factors that are taken into account under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its geologic effects are encompassed by the CEQA criteria used for this analysis. No specific factors related to geology and soils are contained in NEPA, CEQ Regulations Implementing NEPA, or FHWA NEPA regulations in 23 CFR 771 et seq.  TRPA Criteria The “Land” criteria from the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist were used to evaluate the geology and soils impacts of the alternatives. The project would result in a significant impact related to geology and soils if:  compaction or covering of the soil beyond the limits allowed in the land capability districts;  change in the topography or ground relief features of the site inconsistent with the natural surrounding conditions;  unstable soil conditions during or after completion of construction;  continuation of or increase in wind or water erosion of soils, either on or off the site; or  exposure of people or property to earthquakes or related geologic hazards. CEQA Criteria In accordance with Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines, an alternative was determined to result in a significant impact related to geology and soils if it would:   expose people or structures to potential substantial adverse effects, including the risk of loss, injury, or death involving:  rupture of a known earthquake fault, as delineated on the most recent Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Map issued by the State Geologist for the area or based on other substantial evidence of a known fault;  strong seismic ground shaking;  seismic-related ground failure, including liquefaction;  result in substantial soil erosion or the loss of topsoil; or  be located on a geologic unit or soil that is unstable, or that would become unstable as a result of the project, and potentially result in on or offsite landslide, lateral spreading, subsidence, liquefaction or collapse. ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF THE PROJECT ALTERNATIVES Impact 3.11-1: Soil compaction and land coverage Implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D would result in an increase in land coverage within the project site limits: for Alternative B, between 5.47 and 7.62 acres; for Alternative C, 1.06 acres; and for Alternative D, between 5.76 and 7.91 acres. Because the project would comply with TRPA land coverage regulations, including mitigation of disturbances in LCD 1b at a ratio of 1.5:1, TRPA permit requirements (e.g., SWPPP, BMPs), and (for mixed-use development, including replacement housing) transfer of excess allowable land coverage, there would be minimal potential to create an adverse effect related to land coverage. Alternatives A and E would not result in changes to TRPA-related land coverage. NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, and D would avoid or minimize the soil compaction and land coverage environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; No Impact for Alternatives A and E CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations: Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, and D; No Impact for Alternatives A and E Alternatives B, C, and D would create new coverage in accordance with TRPA land coverage regulations within LCDs 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Implementation of Alternatives A and E would not alter existing land coverage patterns. Table 3.11-4 provides a summary of preliminary coverage increases by LCD for the build alternatives. The preliminary coverage numbers would be refined as the design process progresses and before TRPA permit acknowledgement. The information presented here, although preliminary, is an accurate representation of the nature of the land coverage changes associated with the build alternatives and is sufficient for environmental impact analysis. The option to restripe Lake Parkway west of US 50 would not affect coverage, because it would occur within the paved portions of the existing roadway.  Table 3.11-4 Summary of Preliminary Land Coverage Increases for Alternatives B, C, D, and E  Alternatives/Options1  Net Increase in Land Coverage by LCD (acres)  Total (acres)  1a  1b  2  3  4  5  6  7  B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action)                    With signal at US 50/Lake Parkway  0.43  1.46  0.19  0.74  0.47  2.75  0.59  0.99  7.62  With roundabout at US 50/Lake Parkway  0.29  1.07  0.12  0.64  0.24  1.75  0.34  1.02  5.47  C: Triangle One-Way                    With signal at US 50/Lake Parkway  0.03  0.27  0.00  -0.25  0.29  0.87  0.07  -0.22  1.06  D: PSR Alternative 2                    With signal at US 50/Lake Parkway  0.43  1.45  0.19  0.74  0.47  1.99  0.59  2.05  7.91  With roundabout at US 50/Lake Parkway  0.29  1.06  0.12  0.64  0.24  0.99  0.34  2.08  5.76  E: Skywalk   No Change in Land Coverage  1 The number of lanes refers to the section of Lake Parkway west of US 50. “Signal” or “roundabout” refers to the traffic control treatment at US 50/Lake Parkway with Alternatives B, C, and D.  Source: Wood Rodgers 2015  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Alternative A would not result in changes to TRPA-regulated land coverage. For this reason, Alternative A would have no impact to this resource for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements As shown in Table 3.11-4, Alternative B would create a net increase in land coverage between 5.47 and 7.62 acres relative to existing conditions and depending on the type of traffic control used at the US 50/Lake Parkway intersection. With a signal at US 50/Lake Parkway, approximately 4.8 acres of this new coverage would be created within high capability lands (LCDs 4 through 7), with the remaining 2.82 acres occurring on low capability land (LCDs 1a, 1b, 2, and 3). The proposed roundabout at this intersection would create 3.65 acres within high capability lands and 2.12 acres of coverage on low capability lands—slightly less than with a signal at this intersection, because the center of the roundabout would be pervious landscape and, therefore, not include coverage.  Although TRPA Code Section 30.5 prohibits additional land coverage in low capability land, an exemption is provided for public service facilities (i.e., linear public facilities or LPFs). TRPA and TTD have determined that the realignment of US 50 is an LPF that is necessary to improve public safety, reduce vehicle congestion, improve air quality, and encourage active transportation modes within the tourist core area. In addition, these agencies have determined that the general alignment of existing and proposed US 50 runs perpendicular to the Edgewood Creek, Golf Course Creek, and Stateline Creek SEZs and disturbance within these areas cannot be avoided; however, the increased land coverage and disturbance would be minimized through application of BMPs and restoration of low capability lands (LCDs 1a, 1b, 2, and 3) at a ratio of 1.5 acres of restoration for every 1 acre of disturbance (in accordance with TRPA Code Section 30.5.3). Therefore, Alternative B would qualify for this exemption.  TRPA’s base allowable coverage standards by LCD normally limit the amount of coverage permitted for a project on a parcel-by-parcel basis (TRPA Code Section 30.4.1.A); however, because the project is an LPF (in accordance with TRPA Code Sections 21.4 and 30.4.2.D), the allowable land coverage would be limited, instead, to the minimum amount needed to achieve the project’s public purpose. If the land coverage proposed by the project exceeds the base allowable coverage for a given parcel, the project proponent would purchase and transfer the required coverage allowance from offsite parcel owners (“sending parcels”) in accordance with TRPA Code Chapter 30. The amount of coverage allowance to be purchased and transferred would be determined on a parcel-by-parcel basis as a function of: (1) the extent of TRPA-verified legally existing coverage; (2) the land capability and base allowable coverage of the parcel; (3) the type of agreement between the applicant and the affected parcel owners (such as a recorded deed-restricted easement or right-of-way dedication); and (4) the size of the affected parcel or width of the recorded easement. These details are unknown at this time and would be dependent on the alternative selected. Before TRPA permit acknowledgement, TTD would be required to demonstrate evidence of the source of coverage, the purchase or transfer of the required coverage allowance, and restoration of any relocated coverage, in accordance with TRPA regulations. TRPA Code requires land coverage transfers to come from within the same hydrologically related area (HRA), as defined by TRPA. The project site is located within the South Stateline HRA, which, at approximately 11,000 acres, is the smallest HRA in the Basin. The South Stateline HRA includes the two study area watersheds (Bijou Park and Edgewood Creek) and two small adjacent watersheds (Bijou Creek and Burke Creek) (TRPA 2015). Transfers from outside the project’s HRAs can only be permitted if transferred from sensitive lands (LCDs 1a, 1b, 1c, 2, and 3) to non-sensitive lands (LCDs 4 through 7) and if the receiving parcel is located farther than 300 feet from the high water line of Lake Tahoe (Code Section 30.4.3.B.6). These restrictions help ensure that development of excess land coverage and the accompanying mitigation affect the same or related soil and water resource areas.  The TCAP includes policies that encourage the reduction of coverage for all projects within the tourist core and encourage landscaping in all public and private redevelopment projects. Alternative B would incorporate the following measures to minimize coverage requirements:  Reduced width of sidewalks and road shoulders,  Reduced width of some left turn lanes, and  Landscaped medians and increased green space in the existing US 50 corridor.  Overall, the Alternative B transportation improvements would result in a net increase in land coverage between 5.47 and 7.62 acres. Because the project would comply with TRPA land coverage regulations, including mitigation of disturbances in LCD 1b at a ratio of 1.5:1, the potential for Alternative B to create an adverse effect related to land coverage would be a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the soil compaction and land coverage environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents, as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. Redevelopment of the mixed-use sites could further increase coverage, before reductions are made for transfer of excess allowable land coverage.  The conceptual layout of the mixed-use development sites (refer to Exhibit 2-9) includes a mix of parcels with extensive existing coverage and some undeveloped parcels. Redevelopment of these sites would comply with TRPA land coverage regulations. The entire area of Sites 1 and 3 and most of Site 2 would be located within the Tourist Core Town Center. Areas within the Town Center would be permitted up to 70 percent maximum allowable land coverage within LCDs 4 through 7 (TRPA Code Section 30.4.2.B.1). All land coverage in excess of the base allowable would be purchased and transferred using the transfer ratios described in the TRPA Code, which would result in an overall reduction in land coverage. For example, a half-acre parcel in LCD 7 would have a base allowable land coverage of approximately 6,500 square feet. If this parcel were located within a Town Center, the maximum allowable land coverage would be approximately 15,250 square feet. To take advantage of this increase in allowable land coverage, the project would be required to purchase and transfer the difference between the base allowable and the maximum allowable land coverage, using the transfer ratios in TRPA Code Table 30.4.4-1. In this case, because the transfer ratio required for projects proposing 70 percent coverage is 2:1, the project would be required to purchase and transfer approximately 16,400 square feet of land coverage, resulting in a net reduction in land coverage. As described above, Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in an increase in land coverage relative to existing conditions. Because the project would comply with TRPA land coverage regulations, including mitigation of disturbances in LCD 1b at a ratio of 1.5:1 and transfer of excess allowable land coverage, the potential for Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to create an adverse effect related to land coverage would be a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize the soil compaction and land coverage environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for soil compaction and land coverage environmental consequences as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential soil compaction and land coverage impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on soil compaction and land coverage. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative B would minimize the soil compaction and land coverage environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements The Alternative C transportation improvements would create a net increase in land coverage of 1.06 acres. Although Alternative C would create 0.27 acre of additional land coverage in LCD 1b and 0.03 acre in LCD 1a, there would be a reduction of 0.25 acre in LCD 3, resulting in a net increase in 0.05 acre of new coverage on low capability lands (LCDs 1a, 1b, 2, and 3). The remaining 1.01 acres coverage increase would occur on high capability lands (LCD 4 through 7). Overall, this is between 4.41 and 6.56 acres less new land coverage than under Alternative B. Alternative C would be subject to the same TRPA land coverage regulations described under Alternative B. Alternative C would also be subject to the same permitting requirements, including completion of a SWPPP and installation of permanent and temporary BMPs. Alternative C transportation improvements would result in a net increase in land coverage of 1.06 acres; however, the project would comply with all TRPA land coverage regulations, including mitigation of disturbances in low capability lands at a ratio of 1.5:1. Therefore, the potential for Alternative C transportation improvements to create an adverse effect related to land coverage would be a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the soil compaction and land coverage environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents, as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. Redevelopment of the mixed-use sites could further increase coverage, before reductions are made for transfer of excess allowable land coverage. The conceptual mixed-use development considered under Alternative C would be subject to the same TRPA land coverage regulations and permitting requirements evaluated under Alternative B.  Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a net increase in land coverage relative to existing conditions; however, the project would comply with all TRPA land coverage regulations, including mitigation of disturbances in low capability lands at a ratio of 1.5:1 and transfer of excess allowable land coverage. Therefore, the potential for Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to create an adverse effect related to land coverage would be a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would avoid or minimize the soil compaction and land coverage environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for soil compaction and land coverage environmental consequences as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential soil compaction and land coverage impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on soil compaction and land coverage. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative C would minimize the soil compaction and land coverage environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2  Transportation Improvements Alternative D transportation improvements would create a net increase in land coverage between 5.76 and 7.91 acres relative to existing conditions and depending on the type of traffic control used at the US 50/Lake Parkway intersection. With a signal and US 50/Lake Parkway, approximately 5.1 acres of this new coverage would be created in high capability lands (LCDs 4 through 7), with the remaining 2.81 acres occurring on low capability land (LCDs 1a, 1b, 2, and 3). The proposed roundabout at this intersection would create 3.65 acres of coverage on high capability lands and 2.11 acres of coverage on low capability lands. For both signalized and roundabout options, Alternative D would create an additional 0.29 acre of land coverage when compared to Alternative B. Alternative D would be subject to the same permitting requirements, including completion of a SWPPP and installation of permanent and temporary BMPs. As described above, Alternative D would result in a net increase in land coverage relative to existing conditions; however, the project would comply with all TRPA land coverage regulations, including mitigation of disturbances in low capability lands at a ratio of 1.5:1. Therefore, the potential for Alternative D transportation improvements to create an adverse effect related to land coverage would be a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the soil compaction and land coverage environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Redevelopment of the mixed-use sites could further increase coverage, before reductions are made for transfer of excess allowable land coverage. The conceptual mixed-use development sites considered under Alternative D (refer to Exhibit 2-11) would be subject to the same TRPA land coverage regulations and permitting requirements evaluated under Alternative B.  As described above, Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a net increase in land coverage relative to existing conditions; however, the project would comply with all TRPA land coverage regulations, including mitigation of disturbances in low capability lands at a ratio of 1.5:1 and transfer of excess allowable land coverage.

Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on soil compaction and land coverage. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative D would minimize the soil compaction and land coverage environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E would create an elevated pedestrian structure in an area that is currently 100 percent covered in impervious materials. Because Alternative E would not result in changes to TRPA-regulated land coverage, it would have no impact relative to land coverage for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.   Impact 3.11-2: Increased erosion and alteration of topography during construction During construction, transportation improvements and replacement housing included in Alternatives B, C, D, and Alternative E would require ground disturbance and soil exposure, which could result in increased erosion and alteration of the existing topography. The total area of temporary and permanent disturbance (including areas that are currently developed or disturbed) would be 56.49 acres for Alternative B, 52.20 acres for Alternative C, 52.39 acres for Alternative D, and 0.79 acre for Alternative E. Because the project site is located in an urban environment, much of the project site has been developed or extensively disturbed. Topographic changes resulting from the project would be minimized and would be consistent with the existing urban environment. The potential for erosion and sediment movement would be minimized through compliance with Lahontan RWQCB and TRPA permit conditions and regulations. Alternative A would result in no changes to existing conditions related to erosion and alteration of topography. NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the erosion and alteration of topography environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; No Impact for Alternative A  CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations: Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; No Impact for Alternative A. Implementation of the project would require grading, excavation, and removal of existing asphalt and road materials and demolition and removal of existing structures in the area of Moss, Echo, and Fern Roads for transportation improvements and replacement housing included in Alternatives B, C, and D. Excavation would also be required to modify or install storm drain systems and for the relocation of underground utilities.  These construction activities would result in temporary disturbance of soil and would expose disturbed areas to precipitation during storm events. Rain of sufficient intensity and duration could dislodge soil particles, generate runoff, and cause localized erosion. Soil disturbance during the summer months could result in loss of topsoil from wind erosion and runoff from thunderstorm events. Additionally, the project would result in ground disturbance within and directly adjacent to the Edgewood Creek, Golf Course Creek, and Stateline Creek SEZ areas. The project site is located in an urban area, however, and much of the disturbance would occur in areas that have been developed and are already heavily disturbed. Although construction in developed areas would expose the soil surface and temporarily increase the potential for erosion, it would not add to the total acreage of land disturbance within the project site. Areas of the project site that are undeveloped have been previously disturbed by construction, or other human activity but are now covered by native or ornamental vegetation. The expansion of development into these areas would create new permanent ground disturbance. The amount of temporary and permanent ground disturbance created by each alternative is shown in Table 3.11-5, below.  Table 3.11-5 Acres of Ground Disturbance by Alternative  Alternative  Temporary  Permanent  Total  Undeveloped  Developed  Total  Undeveloped  Developed  Total  Undeveloped  Developed  Overall Total  Alternative A: No Build (No Action)  NA  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action)  11.72  10.78  22.50  9.69  24.30  33.99  21.41  35.08  56.49  Alternative C: Triangle One-Way  13.58  10.62  24.20  5.19  22.81  28.00  18.77  33.43  52.20  Alternative D: PSR Alternative 2  10.83  9.05  19.88  9.34  23.17  32.51  20.17  32.22  52.39  Alternative E: Skywalk  0  0.76  0.76  0  0.03  0.03  0  0.79  0.79  NA = not applicable Source: Wood Rodgers 2015; Adapted by Ascent Environmental   Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Alternative A would not result in changes to topography or ground disturbance that could lead to increased erosion. For this reason, Alternative A would have no impact on these resources for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements The Alternative B transportation improvements would create 22.50 acres of temporary disturbance, 11.72 acres of which would occur in undeveloped areas. Permanent disturbance would total 33.99 acres, with 9.69 acres occurring in undeveloped areas. Temporarily disturbed areas would be stabilized and revegetated with approved plant species following construction; however, the topography of these sites may be altered. In accordance with TRPA Code Section 36.5.1.A, the project would be designed to minimize topographical changes and to maintain the natural slope of the project site where feasible.  The NRCS Erosion Hazard rating estimates the risk of soil loss from sheet and rill erosion (erosion caused by overland flow of water) for disturbed soils where 50 to 75 percent of the soil surface has been exposed (NRCS 2007). Because the soils of the project site have low to moderate runoff potential and the topography (with the exception of stream banks) is gently sloped, the NRCS describes the Erosion Hazard rating at “slight.” This means that adverse, or substantial, erosion would be unlikely under normal conditions.  The BMPs required by TRPA, NDEP, and Lahontan RWQCB as conditions of construction permits would further reduce the potential for soil erosion and protect SEZ areas. One condition of the required NPDES permit is implementation of a SWPPP prepared by a qualified SWPPP practitioner. This plan would detail the BMPs that would be implemented to minimize erosion, reduce sediment transport, and control stormwater flow from the project site. In addition, the SWPPP would address grading and slope stabilization methods. Typical temporary BMPs include properly installed silt fences, sediment logs, detention basins, and inlet protection. Temporary BMPs would be installed before site grading begins and would be maintained throughout construction until permanent erosion control features are functioning. Construction-period BMPs installed as permit conditions have proven effective in controlling site runoff and sediment in stormwater. The required elements of a SWPPP are discussed in greater detail in Section 3.10, “Water Quality and Stormwater Runoff.” After construction is completed, temporarily disturbed areas would be stabilized and revegetated in accordance with TRPA Code Section 61.4. Because the soils of the project site are not highly susceptible to erosion, temporary and permanent BMPs would be installed as requirements of the necessary TRPA and Lahontan RWQCB permits, and areas of temporary disturbance would be revegetated and regraded to match the natural topography of the site, the potential for the Alternative B transportation improvements to increase erosion or adversely affect the topography of the area would be a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the erosion and alteration of topography environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents, as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The redevelopment of the three mixed-use site would create ground disturbance in addition to that described in Table 3.11-5; however, any future development would be subject to the same Lahontan RWQCB and TRPA permit conditions and, thus, would not increase the risk of erosion.  Because the soils of the project site are not highly susceptible to erosion, temporary and permanent BMPs would be installed as requirements of the necessary TRPA and Lahontan RWQCB permits, and areas of temporary disturbance would be revegetated and regraded to match the natural topography of the site, the potential for Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to increase erosion or adversely affect the topography of the area would be a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize the erosion and alteration of topography environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for erosion or alteration of topography environmental consequences as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential erosion or topography impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on erosion and alteration of topography. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative B would minimize the erosion and alteration of topography environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements The Alternative C transportation improvements would create 24.2 acres of temporary disturbance, 13.58 acres of which would occur in undeveloped areas. Permanent disturbance would total 28.00 acres, with 5.19 acres occurring in undeveloped areas. In total, Alternative C would create 52.20 acres of new disturbance, 2.64 fewer than Alternative B. Alternative C would be subject to the same TRPA, NDEP, and Lahontan RWQCB permitting requirements, including completion of a SWPPP and installation of permanent and temporary BMPs. Because of the low erosion hazard of the project site and the stringent BMP requirements described above, the potential impacts of Alternative C transportation improvements in relation to alteration of existing topography and soil erosion would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the erosion and alteration of topography environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The mixed-use development, including replacement housing, considered under Alternative C would create ground disturbance in addition to that described in Table 3.11-5; however, any future development would be subject to the same permitting requirements evaluated under Alternative B. For the same reasons, the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not add to the potential risk of erosion.  Because of the low erosion hazard of the project site and the stringent BMP requirements described above, the potential impacts of Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, in relation to alteration of existing topography and soil erosion would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would avoid or minimize the erosion and alteration of topography environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for erosion or alteration of topography environmental consequences as described for the mixed-use development sites.

Permanent disturbance would total 32.51 acres, with 9.34 acres occurring in undeveloped areas. In total, Alternative D would create 52.39 acres of new disturbance, 1.24 acres fewer than Alternative B. Alternative D would be subject to the same TRPA, NDEP, and Lahontan RWQCB permitting requirements, including completion of a SWPPP and installation of permanent and temporary BMPs. Because of the low erosion hazard of the project site and the stringent BMP requirements described above, the potential impacts of Alternative D transportation improvements in relation to alteration of existing topography and soil erosion would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the erosion and alteration of topography environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on erosion and alteration of topography. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative D would minimize the erosion and alteration of topography environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E would result in ground disturbance for the installation of the support columns for the pedestrian walkway, which could require excavation up to 60 feet deep. Because the remainder of the project site for Alternative E is currently paved, the total area of temporary and permanent ground disturbance would be limited to approximately 34,500 square feet (0.79 acre), depending on the foundation type selected. Permanent disturbance would be limited to the skywalk support columns at approximately 1,500 square feet (0.03 acre). With a disturbance area of less than 1 acre, Alternative E would not be subject to an NPDES permit, and TRPA would hold the regulatory responsibility for erosion control and water quality protection. TRPA requires the use of temporary water quality BMPs in accordance with the TRPA Best Management Practices Handbook. Additionally, the proposed excavation would occur as an isolated disturbance surrounded by urban development, and the area where erosion could occur would be limited to the excavation site itself.  Because the area of exposed soil created by Alternative E would be less than 1 acre, isolated by urban development, and protected by TRPA-mandated temporary construction site BMPs, the potential for erosion and grading impacts would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize the erosion and alteration of topography environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Impact 3.11-3: Exposure to strong seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards The project site is located in a seismically-active area and contains soils that could be subject to liquefaction under saturated conditions. All transportation improvement components of Alternatives B, C, and D would be designed to meet California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) seismic standards and state-specific, seismic design codes. The construction of the pedestrian bridge in Alternatives B, C, and D would require deep excavation and construction of footings in soils that could be subject to liquefaction. These structures would be subject to rigorous highway safety design standards, which would minimize the potential for seismic hazards. Implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would result in the displacement of housing units that are now outside of the inundation area of a seismically induced seiche wave. Implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would also not have the potential to increase the exposure of people and property to inundation by a seismically-induced seiche wave, because the mixed-use sites are outside the inundation area. Alternative E would be subject to the same design standards described for Alternatives B, C, and D and would not alter the level of exposure to seiche hazards. Alternative A would not create new structures that would be exposed to seismic hazards.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the potential risks due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations: Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; No Impact for Alternative A.  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Alternative A would not result in new structures that could be affected by seismic hazards. For this reason, Alternative A would have no impact relative to strong seismic shaking or liquefaction for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Alternative B transportation improvements would include construction and realignment of surface roads and US 50, an elevated pedestrian bridge over the proposed US 50 alignment, a bike path connection to Van Sickle Bi-State Park, and the demolition and replacement of residential and commercial structures. The project would be located in a seismically-active area within 8 miles of two active faults capable of producing large earthquakes. Three more active faults with the potential to generate large earthquakes are located within 15 miles of the project site (Table 3.11-2). A large earthquake on any of these faults could generate strong seismic shaking within the study area (Parikh Consultants 2011), which could damage project structures and surrounding properties, as well as posing a safety risk for people in the area.  The project site contains soils that could be susceptible to liquefaction under saturated conditions. Because existing groundwater monitoring data indicate a groundwater depth of 20–34 feet below grade (Parikh Consultants 2011), liquefaction is not a consideration at shallow depths. The construction of the pedestrian bridge would require excavation depths between 20 and 60 feet for installation of bridge footings. The potential for seismic shaking to create a liquefaction hazard is increased at these depths. The potential for damage caused by seismic shaking and liquefaction would be minimized through compliance with existing seismic design requirements. Project components in Nevada would be limited to surface roads and would be constructed in accordance with current NDOT and American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) seismic design standards. In California, the surface roads and elevated pedestrian bridge would be required to meet Caltrans seismic design standards. The Caltrans project design process requires the completion of a geotechnical design or materials report that covers geology, soils, seismicity, and foundations (Caltrans 2015). A foundation study would also be completed. The foundation investigation and foundation report must be developed and signed by a registered civil engineer or certified engineering geologist and would include project-specific test borings, an evaluation of seismic hazards, and recommendations for footing elevations and pile type (Caltrans 2015). Similarly, the South Lake Tahoe City Code requires geotechnical investigations for all excavations exceeding 10 feet. The City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan requires that all buildings and structures in the City be constructed to withstand seismic shaking and related geologic hazards.  As shown on Exhibit 3.11-2, portions of the project site are located within low-lying areas that could be inundated by a seismically induced seiche wave. Alternative B project components in the inundation area are limited to the improvement and/or realignment of existing roadways. Implementation of Alternative B would result in the displacement of housing units from outside of the seiche inundation area. Although Alternative B transportation improvements would involve construction in a seismically-active area and deep excavation could encounter soil susceptible to liquefaction, the potential risks due to seismic shaking and liquefaction would be minimized through the required compliance with NDOT, AASHTO, and Caltrans design standards and state and local building codes. Therefore, the potential risks to people and property due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards would be a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the potential risks due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents, as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The mixed-use development, including replacement housing, resulting from the implementation of Alternative B would be subject to the seismic safety standards of the International Building Code or CBC. Compliance with these standards would protect structures and people from damage caused by strong seismic shaking or liquefaction. Additionally, the location of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, are outside of the potential inundation area of a 30-foot seiche wave. Although Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would involve construction in a seismically-active area and deep excavation could encounter soil susceptible to liquefaction, the potential risks due to seismic shaking and liquefaction would be minimized through the required compliance with NDOT, AASHTO, and Caltrans design standards and state and local building codes. Therefore, the potential risks to people and property due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards would be a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize the potential risks to people and property due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential risks to people and property due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazard impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on potential risks to people and property due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative B would minimize the potential risks to people and property due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Alternative C transportation improvements would create the same structures as Alternative B and would be located in the same seismic and geologic context. As described above, the potential risks related to seismic shaking and liquefaction would be minimized through the required compliance with NDOT, AASHTO, and Caltrans design standards and state and local building codes. Additionally, as described above for Alternative B, Alternative C would displace housing from outside of the potential inundation zone of the potential 30-foot seiche wave. Compliance with existing seismic design standards and state and local building codes would minimize the potential risks to persons and property due to seismic shaking or liquefaction to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the environmental consequences of implementing Alternative C transportation improvements on potential risks to people from seismic shaking or liquefaction would not be adverse. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the potential risks due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents, as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The conceptual mixed-use development considered under Alternative C would be subject to the same permitting requirements evaluated under Alternative B. For the same reasons, the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, concept would not increase potential risks related to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards.  Although Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would be located in a seismically-active area, compliance with existing seismic design standards and state and local building codes would minimize the potential risks to persons and property due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would avoid or minimize the potential risks to people and property due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential risks to people and property due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazard impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on potential risks to people and property due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative C would minimize the potential risks to people and property due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2  Transportation Improvements Alternative D transportation improvements would create the same structures as Alternative B and would be located in the same seismic and geologic context. As described above, the potential risks related to seismic shaking and liquefaction would be minimized through the required compliance with NDOT, AASHTO, and Caltrans design standards and state specific building codes. Additionally, as described above for Alternative B, Alternative D would displace housing from outside of the potential inundation zone of the potential 30-foot seiche wave. Compliance with existing seismic design standards and state and local building codes would minimize the potential risks to persons and property due to seismic shaking or liquefaction to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the potential risks due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents, as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The conceptual mixed-use development considered under Alternative D would be subject to the same permitting requirements evaluated under Alternative B. For the same reasons, the mixed-use development concept would not add to potential risks related to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards.  Although Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would be located in a seismically-active area, compliance with existing seismic design standards and state and local building codes would minimize the potential risks to persons and property due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would avoid or minimize the potential risks to people and property due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential risks to people and property due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazard impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on potential risks to people and property due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative D would minimize the potential risks to people and property due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E would involve the creation of an elevated pedestrian walkway raised above the US 50 corridor on concrete piers, spanning the California/Nevada state line. Excavation up to 60 feet could be required for installation of piles. As described under Alternative B, the walkway structure would be required to meet Caltrans and NDOT seismic design standards, as described under Alternative B. This would include site-specific geotechnical investigations, borings, and foundation reports that meet the criteria of each state. Additionally, Alternative E is located outside of the potential inundation area of the modeled 30 foot seiche wave. Compliance with these standards would reduce the potential risks to persons or property due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize the potential risks due to seismic shaking, liquefaction, or seiche inundation hazards such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  AVOIDANCE, MINIMIZATION, AND/OR MITIGATION MEASURES No avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures are required to reduce effects on geology, soils, land capability, or coverage such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement for the purposes of NEPA or to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  3.12 HAZARDS, HAZARDOUS MATERIALS, AND RISK OF UPSET This section evaluates the risk of upset associated with the routine use, storage, and transport of hazardous materials, or the potential to encounter hazardous materials during construction, and the potential health consequences. (For purposes of this section, the term “hazardous materials” refers to both hazardous substances and hazardous wastes.) The potential for wildland fire, conflicts with airports, and risk of exposure of schools to hazardous materials that could result from implementation of the build alternatives are also evaluated. The following discussion describes the regulatory background and existing environmental conditions in the project site, and identifies potential impacts of the alternatives. The information provided in this section is derived, in part, from the Phase I Initial Site Assessment, US Highway 50 Stateline Transportation Study Area, South Lake Tahoe, California and Stateline, Nevada, prepared for the Tahoe Transportation District (TTD) by Wallace-Kuhl & Associates and dated November 26, 2014, revised September 15, 2016. The following issues have been dismissed from further consideration in this EIR/EIS/EIS:  The build alternatives are not located close enough to a public airport or a private airstrip to create a conflict or safety hazard. The Lake Tahoe Airport is located approximately 4 miles southwest of the project site. The Minden-Tahoe Airport is located over 9 miles east of the project site. The nearest private airstrip (Bailey Ranch) is located north of Carson City and over 9 miles east of the project site. The project site is not within the designated approach or departure routes of any airports or airstrips. The location of the project site so far from the nearest public or private airstrip or heliport would not result in a safety hazard for people residing or working at the project site.   The build alternatives are not located within 0.25 mile of an existing or proposed school. Bijou Community School is located over 1 mile southwest of the project site. Zephyr Cove Elementary School and Whittell High School are located over 1 mile northeast of the project site. Implementation of the build alternatives would not emit or handle hazardous materials, substances, or wastes within 0.25 mile of an existing or proposed school.  Geological hazards, including seismic hazards and the potential for seiche inundation, are discussed in Section 3.11, “Geology, Soils, Land Capability, and Coverage.” Risks associated with flooding are discussed in Section 3.9, “Floodplains.” Interference with an adopted emergency response plan or emergency evacuation plan is address in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation.” Cumulative hazards and public safety impacts are addressed in Section 3.19, “Cumulative Impacts.” One comment was received in response to the Notice of Preparation related to hazards. It requested information on emergency response plans. Information on potential impacts and mitigation related to emergency response, is discussed in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation.” 3.12.1 Regulatory Setting Numerous federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and programs have been enacted to prevent or mitigate damage to public health and safety and the environment from the release or risk of release of hazardous substances into the community or environment, and to protect human health and environmental resources from potential existing contamination. Other regulations have been developed to address hazards associated with construction in California’s wildland-urban interface (WUI) areas. Key laws and regulations applicable to the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project are discussed below.  FEDERAL Management of Hazardous Materials Federal laws require planning to ensure that hazardous materials are properly handled, used, stored, and disposed of, and if such materials are accidentally released, to prevent or mitigate injury to health or the environment. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the agency primarily responsible for enforcement and implementation of federal laws and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials. Applicable federal regulations pertaining to hazardous materials are primarily contained in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Titles 29, 40, and 49. Hazardous materials, as defined in those regulations, are listed in 49 CFR 172.101. Management of hazardous materials is governed by the following laws:  The Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 (15 U.S. Code [USC] Section 2601 et seq.) regulates the manufacturing, inventory, and disposition of industrial chemicals, including hazardous materials. Section 403 of the Toxic Substances Control Act establishes standards for lead-based paint hazards in paint, dust, and soil.  The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA)(42 USC Section 6901 et seq.) is the law under which EPA regulates hazardous waste from the time the waste is generated until its final disposal (“cradle to grave”).  The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (also called the Superfund Act or CERCLA) (42 USC Section 9601 et seq.) gives EPA authority to seek out parties responsible for releases of hazardous substances and ensure their cooperation in site remediation.  The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986 (Public Law 99-499; USC Title 42, Chapter 116), also known as SARA Title III or the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA), imposes hazardous materials planning requirements to help protect local communities in the event of accidental release.  The Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) rule includes requirements for oil spill prevention, preparedness, and response to prevent oil discharges to navigable waters and adjoining shorelines. The rule requires specific facilities to prepare, amend, and implement SPCC Plans. The SPCC rule is part of the Oil Pollution Prevention regulation, which also includes the Facility Response Plan rule. Transport of Hazardous Materials The U.S. Department of Transportation regulates transport of hazardous materials between states and is responsible for protecting the public from dangers associated with such transport. The federal hazardous materials transportation law (49 USC Section 5101 et seq.; formerly the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, 49 USC Section 1801 et seq.) is the basic statute regulating transport of hazardous materials in the United States. Hazardous materials regulations are enforced by the Federal Highway Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Federal Railroad Administration, and the Federal Aviation Administration. Explosives Regulation of explosives comes under the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Regulation of licenses or permits that are required for the manufacture, import, storage, and use of explosives takes place according to Title 27 CFR, Part 555, under Title XI, Regulation of Explosives (18 USC Chapter 40). Worker Safety The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is the agency responsible for assuring worker safety in the handling and use of chemicals identified in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Public Law 91-596, 9 USC Section 651 et seq.). OSHA has adopted numerous regulations pertaining to worker safety, contained in CFR Title 29. These regulations set standards for safe workplaces and work practices, including standards relating to the handling of hazardous materials and those required for excavation and trenching.  Fuel Reduction and Wildfire Prevention Multi-Jurisdictional Fuel Reduction and Wildfire Prevention Strategy for the Lake Tahoe Region The Multi-Jurisdictional Fuel Reduction and Wildfire Prevention Strategy for the Lake Tahoe Region (Fuel Reduction Strategy) provides land management, fire, and regulatory agencies with strategies to reduce the probability of a catastrophic fire in the Region (LTBMU et al. 2014).  The Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit of the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) is the agency with primary responsibility for implementation of the Fuel Reduction Strategy; however, individual land owners and public agencies are responsible for aspects of its implementation. The Fuel Reduction Strategy is a comprehensive plan that combines projects from the following sources:  Fuel Reduction and Forest Restoration Plan for the Lake Tahoe Basin Wildland Urban Interface (Tahoe Regional Planning Agency [TRPA] 2007);  USFS Stewardship and Fireshed Assessment (Bahro et al. 2007);  California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) Unit Strategic Fire Plans for the Amador-El Dorado Unit and the Nevada-Yuba-Placer Unit (CAL FIRE 2015a, 2015b);  California State Parks;  California Tahoe Conservancy; and  Nevada Tahoe Resource Team, representing Nevada Division of State Lands, Nevada Division of Forestry, and Nevada Division of State Parks. Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (HFRA, also known as the Healthy Forests Initiative), establishes procedures for forest and rangeland restoration projects on USFS and Bureau of Land Management lands. It generally focuses on lands near communities in the WUI, in high risk municipal watersheds, habitat for threatened and endangered species, and where insects or disease are destroying the forest and increasing the threat of catastrophic wildfire. HFRA allows communities to designate WUIs and authorizes fuel reduction projects on federal land. In addition, federal agencies must consider recommendations and give funding priority to communities at risk that have developed Community Wildfire Protection Plans. TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY Article V(c)(3) of the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact (Public Law 96-551) required the development of a conservation plan for the preservation, development, utilization and management of scenic and other natural resources within the Tahoe Basin. TRPA’s Regional Plan for the Lake Tahoe Region addresses growth and development and provides a policy guide for decision-making. Two components of the Regional Plan address policies and regulations pertaining to hazards and hazardous materials: Goals and Policies and Code of Ordinances.  Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities TRPA has not established any environmental threshold carrying capacities related to hazards and hazardous materials.  Regional Plan TRPA regulates growth and development in the Lake Tahoe Region through the Regional Plan, which includes the Goals and Policies, Code of Ordinances, and other guidance documents. The Regional Plan includes a Land Use element identifying goals and policies for addressing the Lake Tahoe Region’s natural hazards (TRPA 2012). Relevant Goals and Policies are described below.  Goals and Policies The Natural Hazards Subelement of the Goals and Policies Land Use Element establishes four policies to support the TRPA’s goal of minimizing risk from natural hazards (Goal NH-1) (TRPA 2012: 2-29). These policies include regulation of development in avalanche and mass instability hazard areas; general prohibition of development, grading, and filling of lands within the 100-year flood plain (except for recreation facilities and public service facilities) and a requirement that facilities within the floodplain be constructed and maintained to minimize impacts; management of forest fuels and use of fire-resistant materials; and encouraging public safety agencies to prepare disaster plans. The full text of these goals and policies, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with the goals and policies, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.” Code of Ordinances The TRPA Code of Ordinances includes regulations for timber harvest activities (primarily in Chapter 61.1 [Tree Removal] and Chapter 61.2 [Prescribed Burning]), which are relevant to fire fuel management for wildfire risks. TRPA must approve the removal of all live trees 14 inches in diameter at breast height or greater. Additionally, all forest management activities must be consistent with TRPA’s Code. Chapter 61, Section 61.3.6 of the TRPA Code provides the following guidance:  Vegetation Management to Prevent the Spread of Wildfire: Within areas of significant fire hazards, as determined by local, state, or federal fire agencies, flammable or other combustible vegetation shall be removed, thinned, or manipulated in accordance with local and state law. Revegetation with approved species or other means of erosion control may be required where vegetative ground cover has been eliminated or where erosion problems may occur. Area Plans, Community Plans, and Plan Area Statements As a means for providing orderly growth and development consistent with the TRPA Regional Plan, various Area Plans, Community Plans, and Plan Area Statements (PASs) have been developed for specific urbanized areas. These plans contain development goals and regulations specific to each plan area. Area Plans, Community Plans, and PASs do not contain policies related to hazards or hazardous materials.  STATE California Management of Hazardous Materials in California In California, both federal and state community right-to-know laws are coordinated through the California Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES). Federal law, i.e., SARA Title III or EPCRA, described above, encourages and supports emergency planning efforts at the state and local levels and to provide local governments and the public with information about potential chemical hazards in their communities. Because of the community right-to-know laws, information is collected from facilities that handle (e.g., produce, use, store) hazardous materials above certain quantities. The provisions of EPCRA apply to four major categories:  emergency planning,  emergency release notification,  reporting of hazardous chemical storage, and  inventory of toxic chemical releases. Information gathered in these four categories helps federal, state, and local agencies and communities understand the chemical hazards in a particular location or area and what chemicals individual facilities are using, storing, or producing onsite. The corresponding state law is Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code (Hazardous Materials Release Response Plans and Inventory). Under this law, businesses within the project site would be required to prepare a Hazardous Materials Business Plan, which could include hazardous materials and hazardous waste management procedures and emergency response procedures, including emergency spill cleanup supplies and equipment. At such time as the applicant begins to use hazardous materials at levels that reach applicable state and/or federal thresholds, the plan is submitted to the administering agency, in this case the El Dorado County Department of Environmental Management, Hazardous Waste Division, to implement and enforce. The plan is to be updated annually. The California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), a department of the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA), has primary regulatory responsibility over hazardous materials in California, working in conjunction with EPA to enforce and implement hazardous materials laws and regulations. As required by Section 65962.5 of the California Government Code, DTSC maintains a hazardous waste and substances site list for the state, known as the Cortese List.  The hazardous waste management program enforced by DTSC was created by the Hazardous Waste Control Act (California Health and Safety Code Section 25100 et seq.), which is implemented by regulations described in CCR Title 26. This program is similar to, but more stringent than, the federal program under RCRA. The regulations list materials that may be hazardous and establish criteria for their identification, packaging, and disposal. Chapter 6.7 of the Health and Safety Code outlines the requirements for underground storage tanks (USTs). The code identifies requirements for corrective actions, cleanup funds, liability, and the responsibilities of owners and operators of USTs. The Unified Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Materials Management Regulatory Program (Unified Program) consolidates, coordinates, and makes consistent the administrative requirements, permits, inspections, and enforcement activities for several environmental programs. The Unified Program is a consolidation of state environmental programs into one program under the authority of a local agency, a Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA). The six program elements of the Unified Program are: hazardous waste generators and hazardous waste on-site treatment, USTs, aboveground storage tanks (ASTs), hazardous material release response plans and inventories, risk management and prevention program, and Uniform Fire Code hazardous materials management plans and inventories. The El Dorado County Department of Environmental Management, Hazardous Waste Division, is approved by Cal EPA as the CUPA for El Dorado County. Transport of Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Plan in California California has adopted U.S. Department of Transportation regulations for the movement of hazardous materials originating within the state and passing through the state; state regulations are contained in Title 26 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR). State agencies with primary responsibility for enforcing state regulations and responding to hazardous materials transportation emergencies are the California Highway Patrol (CHP) and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). Together, these agencies determine container types used and license hazardous waste haulers to transport hazardous waste on public roads. California has developed an emergency response plan to coordinate emergency services provided by federal, state, and local governments and private agencies. Response to hazardous materials incidents is one part of the plan. The plan is managed by Cal OES, which coordinates the responses of other agencies in the study area. Management of Construction Activities in California In California, through the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Act and the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program, the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board (Lahontan RWQCB) has authority to require proper management of hazardous materials during project construction. For a detailed description of the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Act, the NPDES program, and the role of the Lahontan RWQCB, see Section 3.9, “Floodplains,” and Section 3.10, “Water Quality and Stormwater Runoff.” The project falls within the jurisdiction of the state Construction General Permit (Order No. 2009-009-DWQ, as amended by 2010-0014-DWQ and 2012-0006-DWQ). The Construction General Permit covers areas that drain to the Truckee River and establishes a risk-based approach with monitoring. The NPDES Permit and Construction General Permit require that construction projects with greater than 1 acre of disturbance file permit registration documents, including a Notice of Intent and a storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) that includes proposed best management practices (BMPs) and a site-specific Construction Site Monitoring and Reporting Plan developed by a Qualified SWPPP Developer. Although a major focus of the SWPPP is management of stormwater on the construction site, it must also address proper use and storage of hazardous materials, spill prevention and containment, and cleanup and reporting of any hazardous materials releases, if they do occur.  California Worker Safety  The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal/OSHA) assumes primary responsibility for developing and enforcing workplace safety regulations within the state. Cal/OSHA standards are typically more stringent than federal OSHA regulations and are presented in Title 8 of the CCR. Cal/OSHA conducts on-site evaluations and issues notices of violation to enforce necessary improvements to health and safety practices. Title 8 of the CCR also includes regulations that provide for worker safety when blasting and explosives are utilized during construction activities. These regulations identify licensing, safety, storage, and transportation requirements related to the use of explosives in construction.  California Wildfire Responsibility Areas/State Responsibility Areas CAL FIRE implements statewide laws aimed at reducing wildfire hazards, including in WUI areas. The laws are based in large part on hazard assessment and zoning. The laws apply to State Responsibility Areas (SRAs), which are defined as areas of the state in which the state has primary financial responsibility for preventing and suppressing fires, as determined by the state Board of Forestry and Fire Protection pursuant to Sections 4125 and 4102 of the California Public Resources Code (PRC). The applicable California PRC provisions address fire prevention and minimum fire safety standards related to defensible space for industrial operations and other land uses in SRAs (California PRC Part 2, Chapters 1 and 2). Fire safe regulations address road standards for fire equipment access, standards for signage, minimum water supply requirements for emergency fire use, and fuel breaks and greenbelts, among others. Fire protection outside SRAs is the responsibility of federal or local jurisdictions. These areas are referred to by CAL FIRE as Federal Responsibility Areas and Local Responsibility Areas. As of July 2014, owners of habitable structures that can be used as residential space must pay an SRA Fire Prevention Fee to the state. This fee funds state efforts at fire prevention, including defensible space inspections, fire prevention engineering, emergency evacuation planning, and fire hazard severity mapping.  2010 Strategic Fire Plan for California The 2010 Strategic California Fire Plan is the state’s road map for reducing the risk of wildfire. The Fire Plan is a cooperative effort between the state Board of Forestry and Fire Protection and CAL FIRE. By emphasizing fire prevention, the 2010 Strategic California Fire Plan seeks to reduce firefighting costs and property losses, increase firefighter safety, and to contribute to ecosystem health. California Building Standards Code  The State of California provides minimum standards for building design through the California Building Standards Code (CCR, Title 24). The California Building Code (CBC) applies to building design and construction in the state and is based on the federal International Building Code used widely throughout the country (generally adopted on a state-by-state or district-by-district basis). The CBC has been modified for California conditions with more detailed and/or more stringent regulations. Chapter 7A of the CBC specifies building materials and construction standards to be used in urban interface and wildland areas where there is an elevated threat of fire. California Government Code Section 66474.02 Before approving a tentative map (or a parcel map where a tentative map is not required) for an area located in a SRA or a very high fire hazard severity zone, the legislative body of the county must find that: the design and location of each lot in the subdivision, and the subdivision as a whole, are consistent with any applicable regulations adopted by CAL FIRE pursuant to PRC Sections 4290 and 4291; structural fire protection and suppression services will be developed; and ingress and egress meets the road standards for fire equipment access adopted pursuant to PRC Section 4290 and any applicable local ordinance. Nevada Nevada State Emergency Response Commission Section 459.7052 of the Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) requires motor carriers to register and obtain a permit for the transportation of hazardous materials before transporting a hazardous material upon a public highway of the state. As part of this statute the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles (NDMV) requires anyone applying for a permit to transport hazardous waste to have a commercial driver’s license and to undergo a background check that includes a fingerprint based Security Threat Assessment. State agencies with primary responsibility for enforcing federal and state regulations and responding to hazardous materials transportation emergencies are the officers of the Nevada Highway Patrol (NRS 459.250). Nevada State Emergency Response Commission In compliance with the Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, the Nevada State Emergency Response Commission (SERC) was established in 1987. SERC coordinates and supervises the activities of the Local Emergency Planning Committees to ensure that each committee has an approved Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Plan. SERC also collects chemical inventory reports, provides funds through grants, and processes information requests from the public. Nevada Administrative Code  The Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) is the State of Nevada’s code of state regulations. NAC 444.965 to 444.976 contains regulations pertaining to asbestos, including its removal, transportation, and disposal.  Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, Bureau of Waste Management The Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, Bureau of Waste Management manages a Hazardous Waste Program that is responsible for enforcing state hazardous waste statues and regulations in lieu of the EPA. With some modifications, Nevada adopts the federal hazardous waste regulations. The Hazardous Waste Program is responsible for permitting and inspecting hazardous waste generators and disposal, transfer, storage, and recycling facilities. Nevada Department of Public Safety Hazmat Permitting Office The Nevada Department of Public Safety Hazmat Permitting Office is responsible for the permitting and regulating of hazardous materials within the state of Nevada. Section 312 of the SARA requires covered facilities to submit hazardous chemical inventory forms annually. Information required for the substances at the facility include the quantity and location of hazardous chemicals stored or used onsite above the threshold planning quantity. Also required are the categories of each chemical’s physical and health hazards. Nevada Occupational Safety and Health Act The Nevada Occupational Safety and Health Act (Nev-OSHA) promotes safe and healthful working conditions to provide job safety and health protection for workers in the State of Nevada. This act provides the Nevada Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Nevada OSHA) the power to issue citations for conditions inspected and found to be unsafe.  The Nev-OSHA poster (to be displayed in Nevada workplaces) states: each employer shall furnish to each of his employees, employment and a place of employment free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees and shall comply with occupational safety and health standards adopted under the Act (Nevada OSHA 2014). LOCAL City of South Lake Tahoe South Lake Tahoe General Plan  The Health and Safety Element of the City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan contains goals and policies related to wildland fire hazards and protection from hazardous materials. Goal HS-2 addresses minimizing fire hazards, and applicable policies require fire-resistant construction (Policy HS-2.1) and minimum fire flow requirements (Policy HS-2.5). Goal HS-6 addresses eliminating exposure to hazardous materials, waste, and natural substances; applicable policies include stopping construction activity if contamination is encountered (Policy HS-6.2). The full text of these goals and policies, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with the goals and policies, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.” Douglas County Douglas County Code, Title 20, Section 20.690.030(I) requires projects and/or businesses that store hazardous materials, to prepare a spill management plan and containment systems to the satisfaction of the fire district with appropriate jurisdiction. Douglas County Master Plan The Douglas County Comprehensive Master Plan 2035 (DCMP) Land Use Policy 3.7 states that, within all land use designations, a variety of factors including “f) location in a high fire hazard area” shall be considered in reviewing and approving individual development proposals. It should be noted that a draft update of the DCMP was released in November 2011, and approved at the January 5, 2012 County Board of Supervisors meeting. However, the DCMP has not been finalized to reflect the requested changes of the TRPA Board. It may be several months before the update is finalized. Because the DCMP update has not yet been finalized, the relevant policies from the 2006 DCMP update remain in effect and are discussed in this EIS/EIR/EIS.  Section 9, “Environmental Quality,” of the 2035 DCMP includes Goal 9-3, “Reduce the risks of loss from wildlife hazard.” Policies addressing this goal include requiring multiple access points for development in wildfire areas (Policy 9-3B.1) and links from new development to existing development (Policy 9-3B.2); and ensuring that wildfire mitigation practices and policies are implemented throughout the development review process (Policy 9-3B.3). The full text of these goals and policies, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with the goals and policies, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.” Douglas County Hazard Mitigation Plan In 2013 the Douglas County, Nevada Hazard Mitigation Plan was updated in compliance with Section 322 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 USC 5165, enacted under Section 104 the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, Public Law 106-390 of October 30, 2000. The updated plan identifies ongoing and new hazard mitigation actions intended to eliminate or reduce the effects of future disasters throughout the county including drought, flood, epidemic, and wildland fire (Douglas County 2013). Lake Tahoe Geographic Response Plan The Lake Tahoe Geographic Response Plan (LTGRP) (Lake Tahoe Response Plan Area Committee 2014) is the principal guide for agencies within the Lake Tahoe watershed, its incorporated cities, and other local government entities in mitigating hazardous materials emergencies. The LTGRP establishes the policies, responsibilities, and procedures required to protect life, environment, and property from the effects of hazardous materials incidents. The LTGRP establishes the emergency response organization for hazardous materials incidents occurring within the Lake Tahoe watershed. The plan is generally intended to be used for oil spills or chemical releases that impact or could potentially impact drainages entering Lake Tahoe. 3.12.2 Affected Environment REGIONAL SETTING The study area is characterized by developed urban uses, including residences, casinos, hotels, and tourist amenities, with Lake Tahoe located to the northwest and forested, mountainous areas, including Heavenly Ski Resort and Van Sickle Bi-State Park, to the southeast. Project construction activities are planned to occur mostly along major roadways, including US 50, Pioneer Trail, Lake Parkway, Park Avenue, and Stateline Avenue, and adjacent lands.  Topography, Soils, Surface Water, and Groundwater The project site is located within the Sierra Nevada geomorphic province. The Sierra Nevada geomorphic province is a tilted fault block almost 400 miles long that is characterized by intrusions of granitic rocks, metamorphism of host rocks and block faulting along its eastern boundary. The eastern boundary of the province lies near the California–Nevada border and its western boundary is with the Great Valley Provence. The project site is located on the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada mountain range and is approximately 6,200 feet above mean sea level. The project site consists of two distinct soil map units, as delineated by the Natural Resource Conservation Service: Christopher-Gefo complex and Cassenai gravelly loamy coarse sand. The Cassenai series consists of very deep soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from granodiorite. The soils are somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapid permeability, with low to medium runoff. The Christopher-Gefo complex formed from granodiorite glacial outwash with rapid permeability (Wallace-Kuhl & Associates 2014). For more information about soil conditions, please refer to Section 3.11, “Geology, Soils, Land Capability, and Coverage.” The project site is located within the California Department of Water Resources (DWR)-defined Tahoe Valley Groundwater Basin of the Tahoe Valley South Hydrologic Region. According to DWR, the closest well that is actively being monitored is located at the southwest end of Black Rock Road. Since May 2011, the depth to groundwater has fluctuated from approximately 0.5 to 1 feet below ground surface (bgs). Lahontan RWQCB’s GeoTracker website lists a cluster of groundwater monitoring wells located at the Tahoe Tom’s Gas Station facility (4029 Lake Tahoe Boulevard/US 50). According to the public records available, groundwater elevation at this location ranges from 8 to 23 feet bgs. For more information, please refer to Section 3.9, “Floodplains,” for surface water and groundwater discussions.  Wildland Fire Hazards The Lake Tahoe Region is considered a “fire environment,” because of the climate, steep topography, and high level of available fuel in the forested areas. The threat of catastrophic fire is a major public concern. Prior to fire suppression policies and extensive logging in the Lake Tahoe Region and surrounding area, natural fire regimes would have included frequent, low-intensity burns occurring at intervals of approximately 5 to 18 years, which would typically have thinned forest stands and removed hazardous ladder fuels (i.e., shrubs and small trees of intermediate height that allow a ground fire to climb into the forest canopy or crown) (Living with Fire 2015). However, fire suppression policies have allowed the development of vegetation complexes that are more susceptible to high-intensity burning (e.g., crown fires). Hazardous fuel conditions coupled with a WUI/intermix situation have resulted in an increased likelihood of ignition and high-intensity wildfire. CAL FIRE has mapped Fire Hazard Severity Zones (FHSZs) for the entire state, including the Lake Tahoe Region. FHSZs are categorized as: moderate, high, and very high. Classification of Moderate, High, or Very High FHSZs are based on an evaluation of fuels, fire history, terrain, housing density, and occurrence of severe fire weather and are intended to identify areas where urban fires could result in catastrophic losses. According to CAL FIRE’s Fire Resource Assessment Program’s FHSZ Geographic Information System data, shown in Exhibit 3.12-1, the project site is located within moderate, high, and very high FHSZ. Very High FHSZ is defined as a wildland area that supports high to extreme fire behavior or developed/urban areas typically with at least 70 percent vegetation density. The areas within the City of South Lake Tahoe that are characterized as Very High FHSZ contain structures without appropriate roofing and siding materials, have decks or overhanging unenclosed features where embers can be trapped, and lack adequate defensible space around many structures (City of South Lake Tahoe 2011:8-15). Nevada does not have an equivalent FHSZ classification system for fire hazards. However, the Nevada Fire Safe Council has identified the community of Stateline as having a Moderate Fire Hazard Rating (Nevada Fire Safe Council 2004). The relatively low fire hazard is primarily because of good defensible space and moderate slopes in this area. Fuel Reduction Projects The Tahoe Fire & Fuels Team (TFFT) was formed in 2008 to implement the Lake Tahoe Basin Multi-Jurisdictional Fuel Reduction and Wildfire Prevention Strategy (LTBMU et al. 2014). The TFFT has divided the Tahoe Basin into five regions for easier management; the project is located in the South Tahoe and the Tahoe Douglas divisions. According to the 2015 Lake Tahoe Basin Community Wildfire Protection Plan, TFFT’s forest fuels reduction project for the Tahoe Douglas Division has resulted in initial treatment for over 1,005 acres and mechanical treatments on 204 acres. All Nevada state lands and nearly all urban lands have received initial treatment. Fire crews have hand-thinned hundreds of acres in the South Tahoe Division and nearly all urban lands have received initial treatment (TFFT 2015). EXISTING SITE CONDITIONS  Within the project site, existing US 50 has five lanes of through traffic and Pioneer Trail, Lake Parkway, Park Avenue, and Stateline Avenue are two-lane roads. Four resort-casinos, Harrah’s, Harvey’s, Montbleu, and the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, are located along US 50 north of the state line between California and Nevada in the tourist core. South of the state line, parcels along US 50 are developed hotels, restaurants, and shops. Tahoe Tom’s gasoline station is located at 4029 Lake Tahoe Boulevard, at the intersection of Park Avenue and US 50.  Hotels are located along the east and west sides of Park Avenue and Pine Boulevard. Heavenly Village Way is located to the east of Park Avenue and US 50. The north side of Heavenly Village Way is developed with a Marriott resort, the Heavenly Gondola, and Heavenly Village. The south side of Heavenly Village Way is developed with the Heavenly Village Center, containing a Raley’s grocery store and other commercial/retail uses. Properties along Fern Road, Echo Road, and Moss Road are developed with single-family residences and multi-family apartment buildings, with the exception of motels at the west end of each road. An electrical substation is located 125 feet east of the intersection of Fern Road and Montreal Road. Vacant, forested land is located to the north of the electrical substation along the east side of Montreal Road, which changes to Lake Parkway north of Heavenly Village Way. North of Heavenly Village Way, the Forest Suites Resort is located to the west of Lake Parkway.     Exhibit 3.12-1 Fire Hazard Severity Zones in California   Hazards in the Lake Tahoe Region Hazardous conditions can derive from human or natural sources. Human-made hazards are generally associated with the handling of chemicals routinely used in everyday products. Many chemicals used for household cleaning, construction, dry cleaning, film processing, landscaping, and automotive maintenance and repair are considered hazardous. Contamination of soil or groundwater may be caused by the improper storage or disposal of these hazardous materials. Natural hazards can also create conditions hazardous to public health and safety. In the Lake Tahoe Region, natural hazards are most frequently related to the dangers of avalanches, wildfires, flooding, earthquakes, and seiches (TRPA 2012). (Geologic hazards including avalanche, earthquake, and seiche-related hazards are discussed in Section 3.11, “Geology, Soils, Land Capability, and Coverage.” Risks associated with flooding are discussed in Section 3.9, “Floodplains.”) The federal government is the entity with primary responsibility over wildfire protection and suppression in the Lake Tahoe area. The project site is classified as both a Federal Responsibility Area and a State Responsibility Area/Federal Direct Protection Area by the California-Nevada Tahoe Basin Fire Commission. (Direct Protection Areas are established to more efficiently provide protection over a contiguous area, and occur where the agency that provides fire suppression and prevention is different than the agency with legal and financial responsibility to provide those services.) Hazardous Materials Aerially Deposited Lead Aerially deposited lead (ADL) refers to lead deposited along highway shoulders from past vehicle emissions. ADL is the result of tailpipe emissions during the years that lead was used as an additive in gasoline. Even though leaded fuel has been prohibited in California since the 1980s, ADL can still be found along the unpaved areas adjacent to highways that were in use before that time. ADL concentrations along highways can be high enough to cause the soil to be defined as a California hazardous waste. Hazardous waste law requires that this material is managed, transported, and disposed of at a Class I disposal facility (Caltrans 2014). Given the age of the existing roadways, it is likely that ADL has impacted the surface soils along roadway shoulders within the project site. However, in areas where shoulders have been upgraded after the mid-1980s, ADL is not likely to remain.  Asbestos-Containing Materials Asbestos, a naturally-occurring fibrous material, was used as a fireproofing and insulating agent in building construction before such uses were largely banned by EPA in the 1970s. Because it was widely used before the discovery of its health effects, asbestos is found in a variety of building materials, including sprayed-on acoustic ceiling texture, floor tiles, and pipe insulation. Asbestos exposure is a human respiratory hazard when the asbestos becomes friable (easily crumbled) because inhalation of airborne fibers is the primary mode of asbestos entry into the body. Asbestos-related health problems include lung cancer and asbestosis. Asbestos-containing building materials are considered hazardous by Cal/OSHA when bulk samples contain more than 0.1 percent asbestos by weight. Asbestos can be evaluated only by sampling, performed by a certified technician, followed by laboratory analysis. These materials must be handled by a qualified contractor. Structures located adjacent to the study area roads that were constructed before 1980 have a high likelihood of containing asbestos-containing building materials. Lead-Based Paint Lead is a potentially hazardous material that can result in cardiovascular effects, increased blood pressure and incidence of hypertension; decreased kidney function; reproductive problems; and nervous system damage. Lead can be found in old water pipes, solder, paint, and in soils around structures painted with lead-based paints. Lead-based paints are likely present on buildings constructed before the late 1970s, when the quantity of lead in paints became regulated. Potentially hazardous exposures to lead can occur when lead-based paint is improperly removed from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. Lead-based paints and coatings used on the exterior of buildings may have also flaked or oxidized and deposited into the surrounding soils. Structures located adjacent to the study area roads that were constructed before 1980 have a high likelihood of containing lead-based paint. Vapor Encroachment Conditions Vapor encroachment occurs when volatile chemicals migrate from contamination in the soil or groundwater up into a building’s interior space through interstitial space in the soil. Vapor encroachment can pose a potential health threat to the occupants of the building, especially to sensitive populations such as children. Vapor encroachment has been a particular concern with regards to contamination caused by dry cleaning solvents, because these chemicals are highly volatile and toxic. However, vapor encroachment can also occur with other contaminants such as petroleum products. Vapor encroachment can be caused by contamination on-site or off-site from a property.  Wallace-Kuhl & Associates conducted a preliminary screening for vapor encroachment conditions (VECs) beneath the project site using the Tier 1 vapor encroachment screening evaluation, which is based on the guidelines presented in the ASTM E 2600-10 Standard Guide for Vapor Encroachment Screening on Property Involved in Real Estate Transactions (Wallace-Kuhl & Associates 2014). The Tier I screening included performing a Search Distance Test to identify if there are any known or suspect contaminated properties surrounding or upgradient of the project site within specific search radii, and a Chemicals of Concern (COC) Test (for those known or suspect contaminated properties identified within the Search Distance Test) to evaluate whether or not COC are likely to be present. The ISA recommended that screening for VEC should be performed if residential properties were to be developed within the project site. Polychlorinated Biphenyls Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) belong to a broad family of man-made organic chemicals known as chlorinated hydrocarbons. PCBs were domestically manufactured from 1929 until their manufacture was banned in 1979. They have a range of toxicity and vary in consistency from thin, light-colored liquids to yellow or black waxy solids. PCBs are highly persistent in the environment, and exposure can cause serious liver, dermal, and reproductive system damage.  Due to their non-flammability, chemical stability, high boiling point, and electrical insulating properties, PCBs were used in hundreds of industrial and commercial applications. Products that may contain PCBs include: transformers, capacitors, and other electrical equipment; oil used in motors and hydraulic systems; and thermal insulation material. The pole-mounted electrical transformers located in the project site may contain PCBs; however, many utilities have instituted programs to renovate or replace equipment with a mineral oil that does not contain PCBs. A Liberty Energy electrical substation is located 125 feet east of the intersection of Fern Road and Montreal. Should fluid spills or releases from an electrical transformer occur, associated remediation efforts are typically the responsibility of the transformer owner (Liberty Energy) per federal regulation (40 CFR 761.125). Natural Hazards Natural hazards can also create conditions hazardous to public health and safety. In the Lake Tahoe Region, natural hazards are most frequently related to the dangers of avalanches, wildfires, flooding, earthquakes, and seiches (TRPA 2012). (Avalanche and earthquake hazards [such a seiches] are addressed in Section 3.9, “Geology, Soils, Land Capability, and Coverage.” Radon Radon is an invisible, odorless, radioactive gas produced by decay of uranium that is naturally present in rock and soil. The EPA classifies El Dorado County as Zone 2, indicating that predicted average indoor radon levels are between 2 and 4 picocuries per liter of air (pCi/L), and there is a moderate potential hazard (EPA 2016). Douglas County is classified as Zone 1, indicating that predicted average indoor radon screening levels greater than 4 pCi/L. Radon gas can move from underlying soil and rock into houses and other inhabited structures and become concentrated in the indoor air, posing a significant lung cancer risk for the residents (California Geological Survey [CGS] 2009). EPA has established an action threshold of 4 pCi/L for indoor air, above which it is recommended that radon gas in homes is mitigated. Recognized Environmental Conditions The Phase I Initial Site Assessment evaluated the areas along roadways within the project site for evidence of potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (RECs) resulting from current and/or former activities within the study area (Wallace-Kuhl & Associates 2014). RECs occur in the presence or likely presence of any hazardous materials or petroleum products that indicate an existing release, a past release, or a material threat of a release. The term includes properties where hazardous substances or petroleum products are stored, handled, and disposed of under conditions in compliance with applicable laws. RECs identified in the study area are described below.  Gas Station Facilities The Tahoe Tom’s Gas Station facility, 4029 Lake Tahoe Boulevard, is listed on the Lahontan RWQCB Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) database. According to a Denial to Rescind April 23, 1997, No Further Action letter, dated January 18, 2007, two releases have occurred at the facility. The first released occurred in 1989 and a no further action status was granted for the release on April 23, 1997. A second release was discovered in 1998 and on-going monitoring assessment is being conducted for that release. According to a Second Quarter 2014 Quarterly Monitoring Report, dated May 30, 2014, methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) impacted groundwater extends to the west of the facility and the direction of groundwater flow was reported to be to the south, toward Park Avenue. Based on the information reviewed, off-site concerns are noted from potential petroleum hydrocarbon impacted soils at the facility. The former Shell Service Station facility at 3953 Lake Tahoe Boulevard (now a vacant site) is listed on the Lahontan RWQCB LUST database. According to a Lahontan RWQCB letter, dated November 8, 2004, the facility received a no further action status. Based on the information review during this assessment, this former facility is not suspected of negatively impacting the project site at this time. The former Tosco #3553 facility at 4115 Lake Tahoe Boulevard is listed on the Lahontan RWQCB LUST database. According to a Lahontan RWQCB letter, dated March 1, 2005, the facility received a no further action status. The property has been redeveloped with the Chateau development that includes shops and restaurants. Based on the information reviewed during this assessment, this facility is not suspected of negatively impacting the project site at this time. Former Retail Facility The former T-Shirt Connection/SLT Redevelopment Agency facility, 4054 Lake Tahoe Boulevard, is listed on the Lahontan RWQCB LUST database. According to the Lahontan RWQCB GeoTracker website, the facility received a no further action status on September 18, 2003. Based on the information reviewed, this facility is not suspected of negatively impacting the project site at this time. Former U.S. Post Office The former Post Office facility at 3962 Lake Tahoe Boulevard is listed on the Lahontan RWQCB LUST database. According to the Lahontan RWQCB GeoTracker website, the facility received a no further action status on June 11, 2003. Based on the information reviewed, this facility is not suspected of negatively impacting the project site at this time.  Former Caesars Tahoe Hotel and Casino The former Caesars Tahoe Hotel and Casino at 55 U.S. Highway 50 is listed on the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection Corrective Actions/Leaking Underground Storage Tanks database (Nevada Division of Environmental Protection [NDEP] 2016). According to the database, a release of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), perchloroethylene (PCE), and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) to groundwater was reported in 1994. 3.12.3 Environmental Consequences METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS Methods for the impact analysis provided below included a review of applicable laws, permits, and legal requirements pertaining to hazards and hazardous materials, as discussed above, and as applicable to the project alternatives and the project site. Within this framework, existing on-site hazardous materials, wildfire potential, and the potential for other safety or hazardous conditions were reviewed based on site reconnaissance and information available from publicly available hazard and hazardous materials information, site/location and cleanup status information, and other available information. The impact analysis considered potential for changes in the nature, extent, or presence of hazardous conditions to occur on-site as a result of project construction and operation, including increased potential for exposure to hazardous materials and conditions resulting from implementation of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project. Compliance with applicable federal, state, and local health and safety laws and regulations by residents and businesses would generally protect the health and safety of the public. Potential effects associated with the project can be classified as either temporary or permanent. Temporary impacts generally include effects associated with construction activities, including the transport, storage, and use of potentially hazardous chemicals and the potential to encounter hazardous wastes during construction. Permanent impacts generally include effects associated with continued use of US 50 for the transport of hazardous materials. SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA NEPA Criteria An environmental document prepared to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) must consider the context and intensity of the environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the locally preferred action. Under NEPA, the significance of an effect is used solely to determine whether an Environmental Impact Statement must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are encompassed by the CEQA criteria used for this analysis. No specific factors related to hazards, hazardous materials, or risk of upset are contained in NEPA, Council on Environmental Quality Regulations Implementing NEPA, or Federal Highway Administration NEPA regulations in 23 CFR 771 et seq. TRPA Criteria TRPA significance criteria related to human health and risk of upset would be violated if a project would:   result in creation of any health hazard (excluding mental health);  result in exposure of people to potential health hazards; or  involve a risk of explosion or the release of hazardous substances including, but not limited to, oil, pesticides, chemicals, or radiation in the event of an accident or upset condition. CEQA Criteria In accordance with Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines, a project is determined to result in a significant impact related to human health if it would do any of the following:   create a significant hazard to the public or the environment through the routine transport, use, or disposal of hazardous materials;  create a significant hazard to the public or the environment through reasonably foreseeable upset and accident conditions involving the release of hazardous materials into the environment;   be located on a site which is included on a list of hazardous materials sites compiled pursuant to Government Code Section 65962.5 and, as a result, would create a significant hazard to the public or the environment; or  expose people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury, or death involving wildland fires, including where wildlands are adjacent to urbanized areas or where residences are intermixed with wildlands. ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF THE PROJECT ALTERNATIVES Impact 3.12-1: Expose people or the environment to hazards because of the routine storage, use, and transport of hazardous materials or from accidental release or upset Construction activities related to each of the build alternatives could involve the routine storage, use, and transport of hazardous materials typical of road and residential construction projects. Use of hazardous materials would occur in compliance with all local, state, and federal regulations.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the exposure of people or the environment to hazards such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations: Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; No Impact for Alternative A Construction of any of the four build alternatives would temporarily increase the regional transportation, use, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials and petroleum products commonly used at construction sites (such as diesel fuel, lubricants, paints and solvents, and cement products containing strong basic or acidic chemicals), which could result in accidents or upset of hazardous materials that could create hazards to persons and the environment. However, these types of routine uses are carefully regulated and all materials would be used, stored, and disposed of in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local laws. In California, transportation of hazardous materials on roadways is regulated by the CHP and Caltrans, and the use of these materials is regulated by DTSC. Standard accident and hazardous materials recovery training and procedures are enforced by the state and followed by private state-licensed, certified, and bonded transportation companies and contractors. Further, pursuant to 40 CFR 112, a spill prevention, containment, and countermeasures plan or, for smaller quantities, a spill prevention and response plan, that identifies BMPs for spill and release prevention and provides procedures and responsibilities for rapidly, effectively, and safely cleaning up and disposing of any spills or releases would be established for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project. As required under state and federal law, plans for notification and evacuation of site workers and local residents in the event of a hazardous materials release would be in place throughout construction. In Nevada, transportation of hazardous materials on roadways is regulated by NDMV and the Nevada Highway Patrol (NRS 459.250) and the use of these materials is regulated by NDEP Bureau of Waste Management, Nevada Department of Public Safety Hazmat Permitting Office, and Douglas County Emergency Management Department. The US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project would conform to permit and spill prevention plans prepared under SWRCB Construction General Permit (2009-0009 DWQ) to avoid spills and releases of hazardous materials and wastes. Additionally, all materials would be used, stored, and disposed of in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local laws including Nev-OSHA, and Nevada’s Hazardous Waste Management Program regulations, as well as manufacturer’s instructions. Inspections would be conducted to verify consistent implementation of general construction permit conditions and BMPs to avoid and minimize the potential for spills and releases, and the immediate cleanup and response thereto. BMPs include, for example, the designation of special storage areas and labeling, containment berms, coverage from rain, and concrete washout areas.  Construction activity related to the build alternatives would comply with the regulations set forth by these organizations and all materials would be used, stored, and disposed of in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local laws. These existing regulations specify mandatory and prescriptive actions about how to fulfill the regulatory requirements as part of the project definition, leaving little discretion in their implementation. Alternative A: No Build (No Project) With implementation of Alternative A, there would be no construction activities that would involve the use of potentially hazardous materials. Transportation of hazardous materials would reflect existing conditions. Thus, there would be no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Construction and operation of the Alternative B transportation improvements would result in the routine storage, use, and transport of hazardous materials. As discussed above, plans would be developed for the project that outline procedures and responsibilities for rapidly, effectively, and safely cleaning up and disposing of any spills or releases, in compliance with federal and state regulations.  No permanent impacts would be associated with use or disposal of hazardous materials during operation of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project. Transportation of hazardous materials on roadways would be routed to the realigned US 50, which would create the potential for a hazardous materials release in a new area. Implementation of Alternative B is intended to relieve traffic congestion and improve vehicular safety, which could reduce the possibility for traffic accidents that can result in release of hazardous materials that are being transported. Transport of hazardous materials would be regulated, as discussed above, and operation of Alternative B would not appreciably affect the risk associated with upset of hazardous materials during transportation. Compliance with the various federal, state, and local regulations would minimize the risk of a spill or accidental release of hazardous materials during construction and operation of the Alternative B transportation improvements. The impact to the public and the environment from exposure to hazardous materials would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the exposure of the public and the environment to hazards such that such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative B includes development of three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could provide replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Pursuant to the State of California Hazardous Materials Release Response Plans and Inventory Law of 1985 (Business Plan Act, California Health and Safety Code, Division 20, Chapter 6.95, Article 1), the future project applicant(s) or subsequent builder(s) of commercial facilities would be required to prepare a Hazardous Materials Business Plan and inventory of hazardous materials, if inventory would exceed threshold quantities of 500 pounds or more of solids, 55 gallons or more of liquids, 200 cubic feet or more of compressed gases, or include extremely hazardous substances. The Hazardous Materials Business Plan would be prepared before occupancy of subject buildings and would include:   an inventory of hazardous materials handled;   facility floor plans showing where hazardous materials are stored;   an emergency response plan; and   provisions for employee training in safety and emergency response procedures.  The project applicant would pay fees in effect at the time of payment and would submit the business plan to the El Dorado County Department of Environmental Management, Hazardous Waste Division, for review and approval. Hazardous materials would not be handled in regulated quantities without notification of El Dorado County Department of Environmental Management. Compliance with the various federal, state, and local regulations would minimize the risk of a spill or accidental release of hazardous materials during construction and operation of the Alternative B mixed-use development sites. The impact to the public and the environment from exposure to hazardous materials would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the exposure of the public and the environment to hazards such that such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for exposure of the public and the environment to hazards as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential for exposure of the public and the environment to hazards at another location would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact as it relates to the exposure of the public and the environment to hazards. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would minimize the exposure of the public and the environment to hazards such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements The Alternative C transportation improvements include the project components described above under Alternative B, except that it would split eastbound and westbound directions on US 50 from the Pioneer Trail/US 50 intersection in California to Lake Parkway/US 50 intersection in Nevada. As discussed under Alternative B, compliance with the various federal, state, and local regulations would minimize the risk of a spill or accidental release of hazardous materials during construction and operation of the project. Routine storage, use, and transport of hazardous materials would be regulated, as discussed above, and the potential for release of hazardous materials impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the exposure of the public and the environment to hazards such that such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative C includes development of three mixed-use development sites, which could provide replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). As discussed under Alternative B, compliance with the various federal, state, and local regulations would minimize the risk of a spill or accidental release of hazardous materials during construction and operation of the project. Routine storage, use, and transport of hazardous materials would be regulated, as discussed above, and the potential for release of hazardous materials impact associated with Alternative C would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the exposure of the public and the environment to hazards such that such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for exposure of the public and the environment to hazards as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential for exposure of the public and the environment to hazards at another location would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact as it relates to the exposure of the public and the environment to hazards. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would minimize the exposure of the public and the environment to hazards such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements The Alternative D transportation improvements include the project components described above under Alternative B, however, the realigned US 50 would proceed east on a new roadway between existing Echo Road and Fern Road, as opposed to the existing Moss Road. As discussed under Alternative B, compliance with the various federal, state, and local regulations would minimize the risk of a spill or accidental release of hazardous materials during construction and operation of the project. Routine storage, use, and transport of hazardous materials would be regulated, as discussed above, and the potential for release of hazardous materials impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the exposure of the public and the environment to hazards such that such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative D includes development of three mixed-use development sites, which could provide replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). As discussed under Alternative B, compliance with the various federal, state, and local regulations would minimize the risk of a spill or accidental release of hazardous materials during construction and operation of the project. Routine storage, use, and transport of hazardous materials would be regulated, as discussed above, and the potential for release of hazardous materials impact associated with Alternative D would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the exposure of the public and the environment to hazards such that such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for exposure of the public and the environment to hazards as described for the mixed-use development sites.

Construction activities would occur at the same locations and at a similar intensity as under Alternative B. Therefore, compliance with the various federal, state, and local regulations would minimize the risk of a spill or accidental release of hazardous materials during construction and operation of the project, and the potential for release of hazardous materials impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize the exposure of the public and the environment to hazards such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Impact 3.12-2: Exposure to recognized environmental conditions The transportation improvements could affect properties that are included on a list of hazardous materials sites. The project site is located in an area with a moderate to high potential for naturally-occurring radon gas, exposure to which has the potential to cause lung cancer. In addition, ADL could be present on and near roadway shoulders. Although the project incorporates best management practices, avoidance measures, and regulatory compliance, through construction of the project, it would be possible that previously unidentified contaminants, such as radon gas or ADL, could be disturbed or encountered by residents and workers. Although the project incorporates best management practices, avoidance measures, and regulatory compliance to reduce the potential for adverse effects, there is a risk of exposure of residents to radon gas and workers to ADL or other unknown contaminants. NEPA Environmental Consequences: Mitigation Measures 3.12-2a, 3.12-2b, 3.12-2c, and 3.12-2d have been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, D, and E to further reduce to the extent feasible the potential for exposure to recognized environmental conditions; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations: Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, D, and E after implementation of Mitigation Measures 3.12-2a, 3.12-2b, 3.12-2c, and 3.12-2d; No Impact for Alternative A Temporary impacts could occur if construction were to affect sites of known contamination or inadvertently disturb other hazardous materials or wastes in a manner that could release hazardous materials into the environment, or expose construction workers or nearby sensitive receptors to hazardous conditions. Six RECs have been identified within or immediately adjacent to the project site. Five of these sites have all undergone remediation and are not expected to present a substantial hazard to construction. No soil contamination is known or suspected in the project site and, although the potential for groundwater contamination is currently under evaluation at two sites (Tahoe Tom’s Gas Station and Caesars Tahoe Hotel and Casino), the potential for contaminated groundwater within the project site is low. Other hazardous materials potentially encountered during demolition of existing structures and project construction could include asbestos, lead-based paint and other coatings, ADL, heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls, and vapor encroachment conditions. Surveys for and removal of these substances are regulated. The project site could also be affected by undocumented contamination that has not been characterized or remediated and could, therefore, create a hazard to people or the environment. Recognized Environmental Conditions Gas Station Facilities The Tahoe Tom’s Gas Station facility, 4029 Lake Tahoe Boulevard, is listed on the Lahontan RWQCB Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) database. According to a Denial to Rescind April 23, 1997, No Further Action letter, dated January 18, 2007, two releases have occurred at the facility. The first released occurred in 1989 and a no further action status was granted for the release on April 23, 1997. A second release was discovered in 1998 and on-going monitoring assessment is being conducted for that release. According to a Second Quarter 2014 Quarterly Monitoring Report, dated May 30, 2014, MTBE impacted groundwater extends to the west of the facility and the direction of groundwater flow was reported to be to the south, toward Park Avenue. Based on the information reviewed, off-site concerns are noted from potential petroleum hydrocarbon impacted soils at the facility. The former Shell Service Station facility at 3953 Lake Tahoe Boulevard (now a vacant site) is listed on the Lahontan RWQCB LUST database. According to a Lahontan RWQCB letter, dated November 8, 2004, the facility received a no further action status. Based on the information review during this assessment, this former facility is not suspected of contaminating the project site at this time. The former Tosco #3553 facility at 4115 Lake Tahoe Boulevard is listed on the Lahontan RWQCB LUST database. According to a Lahontan RWQCB letter, dated March 1, 2005, the facility received a no further action status. The property has been redeveloped with the Chateau development that includes shops and restaurants. Based on the information reviewed during this assessment, this facility is not suspected of contaminating the project site at this time. Former Retail Facility The former T-Shirt Connection/SLT Redevelopment Agency facility, 4054 Lake Tahoe Boulevard, is listed on the Lahontan RWQCB LUST database. According to the Lahontan RWQCB GeoTracker website, the facility received a no further action status on September 18, 2003. Based on the information reviewed, this facility is not suspected of contaminating the project site at this time. Former U.S. Post Office The former Post Office facility at 3962 Lake Tahoe Boulevard is listed on the Lahontan RWQCB LUST database. According to the Lahontan RWQCB GeoTracker website, the facility received a no further action status on June 11, 2003. Based on the information reviewed, this facility is not suspected of contaminating the project site at this time.  Former Caesars Tahoe Hotel and Casino The former Caesars Tahoe Hotel and Casino at 55 U.S. Highway 50 is listed on the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection Corrective Actions/Leaking Underground Storage Tanks database (NDEP 2016). According to the database, a release of TPH, PCE, and BTEX to groundwater was reported in 1994. Based on the information reviewed, off-site groundwater contamination could be a concern from the release of TPH, PCE, and BTEX at this location, if construction activities extend below the existing ground surface. Disturbance of Materials Containing Asbestos, Lead, or other Hazardous Materials Existing features within the project site are believed to contain hazardous materials, including asbestos, lead, and heavy metals—primarily because many of the existing structures were constructed before the use of these materials was known to cause health concerns and, therefore, became regulated. Demolition of structures and roadways could result in inadvertent release or improper disposal of debris containing potentially hazardous materials; however, federal, state, and local regulations have been developed to address potential impacts related to the handling and disposal of hazardous materials during demolition. Potential impacts can be minimized through adherence to regulatory standards that prescribe specific methods of material characterization and handling. Specific actions incorporated into the build alternatives include the following:  Aerially deposited lead. Exposed soils adjacent to existing roadways may contain elevated levels of lead. Surveying and sampling would be required to determine presence.   Asbestos. All structures requiring demolition would be tested for the presence of asbestos-containing materials. Any asbestos would be removed and disposed of by an accredited contractor in compliance with federal, state, and local regulations (including the Toxic Substances Control Act and the National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants). Compliance with these regulations would result in the safe disposal of asbestos-containing materials.  Lead-based paint or other coatings. A survey for indicators of lead-based coatings would be conducted before demolition to further characterize the presence of lead on the project site. For the purposes of compliance with Cal-OSHA regulations, all coated surfaces would be assumed to potentially contain lead. There is also a potential for soil contamination because of deposition of deteriorated (i.e., flaked, peeled, chipped) lead-based paint adjacent to structures where lead-based exterior paints were used. Loose or peeling paint may be classified as a hazardous waste if concentrations exceed total threshold limits. Cal-OSHA regulations require air monitoring, special work practices, and respiratory protection during demolition where even small amounts of lead have been detected.   Vapor encroachment conditions. If future properties include human occupancy of habitable structures, a screening for VEC should be performed, based on the type of facility, the information regarding the type of contaminant and groundwater flow, and the distance from the contaminant to the property. The screening would indicate if a full VEC study would be necessary; the study would then determine appropriate remediation as needed.  Heavy metals and polychlorinated biphenyls. Spent fluorescent light bulbs and ballasts, thermostats, and other electrical equipment may contain heavy metals, such as mercury, or polychlorinated biphenyls. If concentrations of these metals exceed regulatory standards, they must be handled as hazardous waste in accordance with hazardous waste regulations.  Hazardous waste would be transported and disposed in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations, including the federal Hazardous Materials Transportation Act.  Inadvertent Disturbance of Hazardous Materials or Wastes The disturbance of undocumented hazardous wastes could also result in hazards to the environment and human health. Adverse impacts could result if construction activities inadvertently disperse contaminated material into the environment. For example, soils containing PCBs could be disturbed during site grading. Potential hazards to human health include ignition of flammable liquids or vapors, inhalation of toxic vapors in confined spaces such as trenches, and skin contact with contaminated soil or water. In addition, inadvertent disturbance of asbestos in structures and underground utilities could result in airborne asbestos fibers.  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) With implementation of Alternative A, no construction activities would occur that could disturb hazardous sites. No new structures would be constructed and no existing structures would be removed. Thus, there would be no impact from exposure to environmental contaminants for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Construction and operation of the Alternative B transportation improvements would result in the full or partial acquisition of 99 parcels, and the demolition of associated buildings and other structures on the 42 parcels that would be fully acquired. Although there would be no direct adverse impact on the Tahoe Tom’s Gas Station facility, the alternative does include roadwork near the station; activities would be limited to sidewalk improvements just south of the facility. Concerns are noted from potential petroleum-affected soils located along Park Avenue at the Tahoe Tom’s Gas Station facility and potentially impacted groundwater at the former Caesars Tahoe Hotel and Casino. The structures contributing to the listing for the Shell Service Station facility, Tosco facility, former T-Shirt Connection, or former U.S. Post Office facility have been removed and, as discussed above, no evidence suggests that these sites present a current hazard within the project site. Underground utilities, existing roadways, and the structures to be demolished could contain asbestos and lead-based paints and coatings that require special consideration during demolition and may have affected surrounding soils. Surface soils along US 50 could also contain ADL. The project site could also be affected by undocumented contamination that has not been characterized or remediated. Therefore, this is a potentially significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the potential for exposure to RECs.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative B includes the redevelopment of three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of the three sites would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. Certain hazardous materials and conditions present an elevated risk to residential populations.  Vapor encroachment occurs when volatile chemicals migrate from contamination in the soil or groundwater up into a building’s interior space. Vapor encroachment can pose a potential health threat to the occupants of the building, especially to sensitive populations such as children. Vapor encroachment can be caused by contamination on-site or off-site from a property. The ISA performed for the project recommended that screening for VEC should be performed if residential properties were to be developed. The project is located in an area with a moderate to high potential for naturally-occurring radon gas. Radon gas can be released from underlying soil and rock into houses and become concentrated in interior spaces without adequate ventilation, which has the potential to cause lung cancer.  Incorporation of standard best management practices into the project, along with coordination with regulatory agencies, would reduce the potential for adverse effects that could result from construction on known contaminated sites. However, the project site could be affected by undocumented contamination that has not been characterized or remediated, and construction of utility lines and transportation improvements along US 50 could result in exposure of workers to ADL. Furthermore, because of the potential for naturally-occurring radon gas in the region, there is a risk of elevated radon levels inside project residences or structures; VECs are also a concern in residential properties. Therefore, this is a potentially significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the construction of the Alternative B mixed-use development sites to further reduce to the extent feasible the potential for exposure to RECs.  Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for exposure to RECs as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential for exposure to RECs at another location would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a potentially significant impact as it relates to the potential for exposure to RECs. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the potential for exposure to RECs. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements The Alternative C transportation improvements include the same components described above under Alternative B, except that it would split eastbound and westbound directions on US 50 from the Pioneer Trail/US 50 intersection in California to Lake Parkway/US 50 intersection in Nevada. Construction and operation of Alternative C would result in the full or partial acquisition of 97 parcels and the demolition of associated buildings and other structures on the 40 parcels that would be fully acquired. As discussed under Alternative B, incorporation of standard best management practices and avoidance measures into the project, and coordination with regulatory agencies would reduce the potential for adverse effects that could result from construction on known contaminated sites. However, the project site could be affected by documented contamination at the site of the former Caesars Tahoe Hotel and Casino and undocumented contamination that has not been characterized or remediated, and construction of utility lines and transportation improvements along US 50 could result in exposure of workers to ADL. Construction activities would occur at the same locations and at a similar intensity as under Alternative B. Therefore, Alternative C has the potential to increase exposure of people or structures to RECs, and this impact is considered potentially significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the potential for exposure to RECs. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative C includes the development of three mixed-use development sites, which could provide replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). As discussed under Alternative B, the mixed-use development could expose people to additional hazardous conditions. Due to the potential for naturally-occurring radon gas in the region, there is a risk of elevated radon levels inside project residences or structures. VECs are also a concern in residential properties. Construction activities and the mixed-use development would occur at the same locations and at a similar intensity as under Alternative B.

Construction and operation of Alternative D would result in the full or partial acquisition of 78 parcels and the demolition of associated buildings and other structures on the 37 parcels that would be fully acquired. As discussed under Alternative B, incorporation of standard best management practices and avoidance measures into the project, and coordination with regulatory agencies would reduce the potential for adverse effects that could result from construction on known contaminated sites. However, the project site could be affected by documented contamination at the site of the former Caesars Tahoe Hotel and Casino and undocumented contamination that has not been characterized or remediated, and construction of utility lines and transportation improvements along US 50 could result in exposure of workers to ADL. Construction activities would occur at the same locations and at a similar intensity as under Alternative B. Therefore, Alternative D has the potential to increase exposure of people or structures to RECs, and this impact is considered potentially significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the potential for exposure to RECs. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative D includes the development of three mixed-use development sites, which could provide replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant).

There would be a temporary, elevated risk of accidental ignition of a wildland fire, because of increased construction activity in a forested area that has a moderate to very high fire hazard; however, standard construction practices include provisions to avoid ignitions, so the probability of starting a wildland fire would be very low. Implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D also includes three mixed-use development sites, which could provide replacement housing as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). The mixed-use development could be exposed to potential risk of wildfire because of the siting of mixed-use development within an area containing very high risk of wildfire.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, and D would avoid or minimize the potential to increase exposure of people or structures to wildland fire; No Impact for Alternatives A and E CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations: Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, and D; No Impact for Alternatives A and E The US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project is located in two states that use different systems for determining wildland fire threat. In the California portion of the project site, wildland fire hazard threat is moderate, high, and very high. In the Nevada portion of the project site, the fire hazard threat is moderate. Additionally, the project site is within a WUI in which there is an existing increased likelihood of ignition.  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) With implementation of Alternative A, no construction activities would occur that could increase ignition risk or fuel loading or place people or structures in an area containing moderate to very high FHSZ. There would be no impact from the risk of wildfire for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Implementation of the Alternative B transportation improvements would result in the use of construction vehicles and equipment within portions of a vegetated and forested area with a moderate to very high fire hazard. Construction activities associated with road construction and the pedestrian bridge to Van Sickle, and intersection, bicycle, and pedestrian improvements would include activities such as excavation, grading, vegetation removal, demolition of existing structures, structure erection, laying of concrete and asphalt, finishing, and cleanup. Heat or sparks from construction vehicles or equipment activity could ignite dry vegetation and cause a fire. However, construction activities would be required to adhere to International Building Code standards and City of South Lake Tahoe, El Dorado County, and Douglas County Code standards for fire prevention during construction activities, which require that fire prevention practices be followed and that basic fire suppression equipment be maintained within the project site limits at all times. Removal of woody vegetation from the ROW and staging areas, and the demolition of structures identified in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives,” would occur during the first phases of construction and could further reduce the potential for ignition of wildland fire during the remaining construction phases. In addition, construction activities would not increase fuel loading in the Tahoe Region or reduce defensible space. In fact, the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project has been designed to ease congestion on US 50 through the Stateline area, potentially easing evacuation of the area in the event of a major hazard and improving access for emergency crews.  The realignment of US 50 would be a source of ignition risk because of cigarette butts or accidents along the southeast portion of the project site, which includes Van Sickle Bi-State Park. However, this risk currently exists from drivers using Montreal Road and Lake Parkway. Additionally, this area received fuels reduction and forest health treatments by the California Tahoe Conservancy under the supervision of a registered professional forester and in accordance with the terms of a TRPA Forest Health and Fuels Reduction Permit between December 2013 and spring 2014 to reduce some of the hazardous fuels that could contribute to a wildfire. Therefore, the potential for Alternative B to increase exposure of people or structures to wildland fire would be considered a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the potential to increase exposure of people or structures to wildland fire such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative B includes the redevelopment of three mixed-use development sites, which could provide replacement housing for displaced residents, as well as commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). The potential for ignition risk associated with construction of the mixed-use development would be similar to that described above for the Alternative B transportation improvements. The ignition risk associated with construction of the mixed-use development sites would be minimized similarly to that described above for Alternative B. People and structures occupying the mixed-use development sites would be exposed to the risk of wildfires similar to existing levels of severity in the surrounding neighborhood. The residential buildings would incorporate fire-resistant roofs, fire suppression systems, fire-resistant vegetation, and defensible space in accordance with the requirements of the City of South Lake Tahoe. Additionally, as identified in Impact 3.5-6, adequate fire protection services are available to serve the site. Because the mixed-use development sites are located in an area that is characterized with Very High FHSZ and that currently includes housing units and hotel/motels, construction of the mixed-use development would not change existing conditions related to wildland fire hazards. In fact, wildland fire threat to these structures could be reduced after the new construction because it would include new fire-resistant roofing and updated fire suppression systems, as required by City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan Policy HS-2.1. Furthermore, implementation of Alternative B would not substantially increase the number of residents in this neighborhood residing in a Very High FHSZ, because the new residential construction is intended to provide replacement housing for residents that already live in Very High FHSZ areas. With implementation of Alternative B, although there would be elevated levels of mechanical equipment activity in a forested area that has a very high fire hazard, the potential for standard construction practices to result in wildland fire would be very low. The mixed-use development sites and associated residents would be exposed to significant risk of loss, injury, or death involving wildland fires similar to the existing risk in the surrounding neighborhood. Additionally, the project site is adequately served by fire protection services. This, along with fire-resistant building materials, defensible space, fire-resistant vegetation and strategic planting, and installation of a fire suppression system incorporated into the design of the project, reduces the risks associated with wildland fires. Therefore, the potential for Alternative B to increase exposure of people or structures to wildland fire would be considered a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the potential to increase exposure of people or structures to wildland fire such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential to increase exposure of people or structures to wildland fire as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential for exposure of people or structures to wildland fire would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact as it relates to the exposure of people or structures to wildland fire. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would minimize the exposure of people or structures to wildland fire. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements The Alternative C transportation improvements includes the same project components described above under Alternative B, except that it would split eastbound and westbound directions on US 50 from the Pioneer Trail/US 50 intersection in California to Lake Parkway/US 50 intersection in Nevada. As discussed under Alternative B, although there would be elevated levels of mechanical equipment activity in a forested area that has a very high fire hazard, the potential for standard construction practices to result in wildland fire would be low. Construction activities and the transportation improvements would occur at the same locations and at a similar intensity as under Alternative B. Therefore, the potential for Alternative C to increase exposure of people or structures to wildland fire would be considered a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the potential for exposure of people or structures to wildland fire. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative C includes the redevelopment of three mixed-use development sites, which could provide replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). As discussed under Alternative B, the mixed-use development sites would pose a potential fire ignition risk during construction and expose people and structures to the risk of wildfires similar to the type of risk to people and structures that currently exists in the surrounding neighborhood. Construction activities and the mixed-use development sites would occur at the same locations and at a similar intensity as under Alternative B. Therefore, the potential for Alternative C to increase exposure of people or structures to wildland fire would be considered a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the potential to increase exposure of people or structures to wildland fire such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential to increase exposure of people or structures to wildland fire as described for the mixed-use development sites.

Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact as it relates to the exposure of people or structures to wildland fire. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would minimize the exposure of people or structures to wildland fire. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements  The Alternative D transportations improvements include the same project components described above under Alternative B; however, the realigned US 50 would proceed east on a new roadway between existing Echo Road and Fern Road, as opposed to the existing Moss Road. As discussed under Alternative B, although there would be elevated levels of mechanical equipment activity in a forested area that has a very high fire hazard, the potential for standard construction practices to result in wildland fire would be low. Construction activities and the transportation improvements would occur at the same locations and at a similar intensity as under Alternative B. Therefore, the potential for Alternative D to increase exposure of people or structures to wildland fire would be considered a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the potential for exposure of people or structures to wildland fire. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative D includes the redevelopment of three mixed-use development sites, which could provide replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). As discussed under Alternative B, the mixed-use development sites would pose a potential fire ignition risk during construction and expose people and structures to the risk of wildfires similar to the type of risk to people and structures that currently exists in the surrounding neighborhood. Construction activities and the mixed-use development sites would occur at the same or similar locations and at a similar intensity as under Alternative B. Therefore, the potential for Alternative D to increase exposure of people or structures to wildland fire would be considered a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the potential to increase exposure of people or structures to wildland fire such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential to increase exposure of people or structures to wildland fire as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential for exposure of people or structures to wildland fire would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact as it relates to the exposure of people or structures to wildland fire. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would minimize the exposure of people or structures to wildland fire. Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E would construct a concrete bridge over the entire width and length of the existing US 50 ROW between Stateline Avenue and the northern end of the Montbleu Resort that would serve pedestrians as a “skywalk” walkway along tourist core near the resort-casinos. Construction activities would occur in an isolated portion of the project site and in area free of forested areas. Therefore, Alternative E would have no impact related to increasing the exposure of people or structures to wildland fire for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. 3.12.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures Mitigation Measure 3.12-2a: Conduct surveys for asbestos-containing materials, aerially deposited lead, and lead-based paints and coatings This mitigation would apply to the transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites associated with Alternatives B, C, and D, and Alternative E for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. 1. Demolition of buildings and roadways containing asbestos and lead-based materials shall require specialized procedures and equipment, and appropriately certified personnel, as detailed in the applicable regulations. Buildings and roadways intended for demolition that were constructed before 1980 shall be surveyed for asbestos, while those constructed before 1971 shall be surveyed for lead.  Prior to construction, all existing road right-of-ways in the project site shall be surveyed for lead contamination because of ADL and use of paint and coatings containing lead. All sampling shall be conducted consistent with applicable Caltrans and NDMV requirements.  2. A demolition plan shall be prepared for any location with positive results for asbestos or lead. The plan will specify how to appropriately contain, remove, and dispose of the asbestos and lead-containing material while meeting all requirements and BMPs to protect human health and the environment. A lead compliance plan shall be prepared by a Certified Industrial Hygienist (consistent with the requirements of Caltrans’ SSP 14-11.07).  Prior to demolition, the project applicant shall submit the written plan to the El Dorado County Department of Environmental Management, Hazardous Waste Division, describing the methods to be used to, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) identify locations that could contain hazardous residues; (b) remove plumbing fixtures known to contain, or potentially containing, hazardous materials; (c) determine the waste classification of the debris; (d) package contaminated items and wastes; and (e) identify disposal site(s) permitted to accept such wastes. Demolition shall not occur until the plan has been accepted by the El Dorado County Department of Environmental Management, Hazardous Waste Division and all potentially hazardous components have been removed to the satisfaction of El Dorado County Environmental Health Department staff. The project applicant shall also provide written documentation to the County that lead-based paint and asbestos testing and abatement, as appropriate, have been completed in accordance with applicable state and local laws and regulations. Lead abatement shall include the removal of lead-contaminated soil (i.e., soil with lead concentrations greater than 400 parts per million). 3. Prior to ground disturbance of any soils adjacent to the Tahoe Tom’s Gas Station facility, soil samples shall be collected from the proposed construction footprint at this location to evaluate potential impacts from a petroleum hydrocarbon release that was discovered in 1998. Based on the results of the sampling, and consistent with standard industry practice, remediation measures shall be developed and implemented to the satisfaction of the El Dorado County Department of Environmental Management, Hazardous Waste Division. Mitigation Measure 3.12-2b: Prepare a construction hazardous materials management plan This mitigation would apply to the transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites associated with Alternatives B, C, and D, and Alternative E for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. A construction hazardous materials management plan shall be developed to address potentially contaminated soil, contaminated groundwater, lead-based paint, and asbestos-containing materials that may be encountered during project construction activities. The construction hazardous materials management plan shall include provisions for agency notification, managing contaminated materials, sampling and analytical requirements, and disposal procedures. The plan shall include identification of construction site BMPs to minimize the potential for water quality impacts.  The construction hazardous materials management plan shall cover, at a minimum, the following:  petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soils and/or groundwater that may be encountered during project construction activities in areas where construction depths exceed 2 feet below ground surface (bgs) in the vicinity of the RECs described above;  soils identified by the ADL surveys as being contaminated by lead within survey area ROWs;  materials identified by the lead-based paint and asbestos-containing materials surveys as contaminated by lead-based paint and asbestos-containing materials within bridge, pipe, and building materials;   guidance for relocation, removal, or repair of hazardous materials storage facilities (USTs or ASTs) that are affected by project construction; and  information on assessment and potential handing of contaminated soils found during relocation. The plan shall include procedures to stop work if evidence of potential hazardous materials or contamination of soils or groundwater is encountered during construction, including the applicable requirements of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and CCR Title 22 regarding the disposal of wastes. Mitigation Measure 3.12-2c: Conduct radon investigation and implement radon-resistant construction techniques This mitigation would apply to mixed-use development sites associated with Alternatives B, C, and D for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Prior to the occupancy of housing units associated with the three future mixed-use development sites, the applicant or construction manager shall retain a licensed radon contractor to determine if radon is detected beyond the 4 pCi/L threshold. If the amount of radon exceeds the established threshold, the applicant shall retain a licensed radon contractor to reduce the radon in the affected residences to below the established threshold. Methods include, but are not limited to, the soil suction radon reduction system, which entails the installation of a vent pipe system and fan that pull radon from beneath the house and vent it to the outside. The radon contractor shall develop clear instructions for proper maintenance of the radon monitoring systems that would be installed in each residence, as well as the radon monitoring and reduction system, if required. The property disclosure statements shall indicate that the site is within an area with a moderate potential for indoor radon levels. Mitigation Measure 3.12-2d: Conduct screening for VECs and, if necessary, conduct sampling and develop and implement remediation measures This mitigation would apply to the mixed-use development sites associated with Alternatives B, C, and D for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Prior to ground disturbance on any parcel intended for human occupancy, the applicant or construction manager shall retain an Environmental Professional as defined in 40 CFR Section 312.10 to perform a screening-level VEC evaluation based on the type of facility, information regarding the type of contaminant and groundwater flow, and the distance from the contaminant to the property to determine whether further study and sampling is warranted. If recommended by the screening, sampling shall be designed and conducted in coordination with DTSC and the CUPA, as appropriate. Based on the results of the sampling, and consistent with standard industry practice, remediation measures shall be developed and implemented to the satisfaction of the appropriate approval agency before building occupancy. Significance after Mitigation Implementation of Mitigation Measures 3.12-2a, 3.12-2b, 3.12-2c, and 3.12-2d would require that asbestos-containing building materials, lead-based paint, and other hazardous substances in building components are identified, removed, packaged, and disposed of in accordance with applicable state laws and regulations. This would minimize the risk of an accidental release of hazardous substances that could adversely affect human health or the environment. This would substantially reduce the potential hazards to construction personnel and the public from encountering documented or undocumented hazardous materials, including ADL and radon, to a less-than-significant level for all the build alternatives for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the environmental consequences of implementing the build alternatives with Mitigation Measures 3.12-2a, 3.12-2b, 3.12-2c, and 3.12-2d would not be adverse. 3.13 AIR QUALITY This section includes a discussion of existing air quality conditions, a summary of applicable air quality regulations, and an analysis of potential short-term and long-term air quality impacts that could result from implementation of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project. The methods of analysis for short-term construction, long-term regional (operational), local mobile-source, and toxic air emissions are consistent with the recommendations of applicable regulatory agencies. In addition, mitigation measures are recommended as necessary to reduce significant air quality impacts. One comment was received on the Notice of Preparation (NOP)/Notice of Intent (NOI) that expressed concern that future congestion, because of development, would occur at the realigned US 50 loop and conflict with applicable air quality thresholds. All applicable air quality thresholds were considered in this analysis and used to evaluate air emissions from the project. Operational-related emissions would primarily be associated with mobile-sources (e.g., as a function of vehicle miles traveled [VMT] and trip generation from land-use development). These impacts are addressed below in Impact 3.13-2, Consistency with air quality plans and regional transportation conformity. However, with build Alternatives B, C, and D, the addition of the mixed-use development sites would result in operational area-source emissions associated with certain sources such as fireplaces/woodstoves, the use of consumer products, landscape maintenance equipment, and application of architectural coatings to buildings and parking lots. Because the proposed mixed-use development sites would replace existing residences and business planned to be displaced, the development of the mixed-use sites would not result in substantial new area-source emissions above existing conditions (i.e., no build Alternative A). Build Alternative E would not include new mixed-use development and therefore, similar to the No Build Alternative A, no increases in operational area sources would occur. This issue is not addressed further in this section and operational-related impacts to air quality focus on transportation-related emissions. Asbestos is the common name for a group of naturally occurring fibrous silicate minerals that can separate into thin but strong and durable fibers. Naturally Occurring Asbestos (NOA) is located in many parts of California and is commonly associated with serpentine soils and rocks. The asbestos map of western El Dorado County (Asbestos Review Areas, Western Slope, County of El Dorado, State of California; El Dorado County 2005) shows the location of individual parcels and areas within the following four categories considered to be subject to elevated risk of containing NOA. Based on this map, the project site is not located within any of the areas known to contain NOA. Asbestos may be contained in buildings/structures and could potentially be released during demolition of existing structures. However, air district rules and regulations are in place that would ensure the proper removal, handling, and disposal of materials potentially containing asbestos if it were to be discovered and therefore asbestos would not be released into the air. Section 3.12, “Hazards, Hazardous Materials, and Risk of Upset,” further evaluates the potential for asbestos exposure during demolition activities. This issue is not addressed further in this section. Minor odors from the use of heavy duty diesel equipment and the laying of asphalt during construction activities would be intermittent and temporary, and would dissipate rapidly from the source with an increase in distance. Construction-related odors would be considered temporary and minor. Land uses that are major sources of odor typically include wastewater treatment and pumping facilities, sanitary landfills, transfer stations, recycling and composting facilities, and various industrial uses such as chemical manufacturing and food processing. There are no major odor sources adjacent to or in the immediate vicinity of the project site. Further, El Dorado County Air Quality Management District (EDCAQMD) Rule 205-Nuisance is in place to protect citizens from harmful odors should they occur. This issue is not addressed further in this section. 3.13.1 Regulatory Setting The US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project is located in portions of Douglas County, Nevada and the City of South Lake Tahoe in El Dorado County, California. The entire project site is in the Lake Tahoe Basin (Tahoe Basin). The portion of the project site in California is part of the California Air Resources Board (ARB)-designated Lake Tahoe Air Basin (LTAB). The LTAB consists of the portions of the Tahoe Basin that are in the jurisdiction of either the EDCAQMD or the Placer County Air Pollution Control District (PCAPCD). For ARB-regulatory purposes, the LTAB does not include the Nevada side of the Tahoe Basin. Nonetheless, the geophysical, climatological, and meteorological characteristics of the Nevada side of the Tahoe Basin are similar to those of the California side.  Air quality in the LTAB, including the entire project site, is regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA). The California side of the project site is under the jurisdiction of ARB and EDCAQMD. The Nevada side of the project site is in the jurisdiction of the State of Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) Bureau of Air Pollution Control (BAPC) and Bureau of Air Quality Planning (BAQP). Each of these agencies develop rules, regulations, policies, and/or goals to comply with applicable regulation. Although EPA regulations may not be superseded, state and local regulations may be more stringent. FEDERAL U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  EPA has been charged with implementing national air quality programs. The EPA air quality mandates are drawn primarily from the federal Clean Air Act (CAA), which was enacted in 1970. The most recent major amendments to the CAA were made by Congress in 1990. Criteria Air Pollutants The CAA required EPA to establish national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). As shown in Table 3.13-1, EPA has established primary and secondary NAAQS for the following criteria air pollutants: ozone, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), respirable and fine particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), and lead. The primary standards protect the public health and the secondary standards protect public welfare. Attainment status of the AAQS for the LTAB are shown below in Table 3.13-2. The CAA also required each state to prepare an air quality control plan referred to as a State Implementation Plan (SIP). The federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) added requirements for states with nonattainment areas to revise their SIPs to incorporate additional control measures to reduce air pollution. The SIP is modified periodically to reflect the latest emissions inventories, planning documents, and rules and regulations of the air basins as reported by their jurisdictional agencies. EPA is responsible for reviewing all SIPs to determine whether they conform to the mandates of the CAA and its amendments, and whether implementation would achieve air quality goals. If EPA determines a SIP to be inadequate, a federal implementation plan that imposes additional control measures may be prepared for the nonattainment area. If an approvable SIP is not submitted or implemented within the mandated time frame, sanctions may be applied to transportation funding and stationary air pollution sources in the air basin.    Table 3.13-1 Ambient Air Quality Standards and Attainment Status in the Lake Tahoe Air Basin  Pollutant  Averaging Time  California 1, 2  National 3  Primary 2, 4  Secondary 2, 5  Ozone  1-hour  0.09 ppm (180 μg/m3)  –5  Same as primary standard  8-hour  0.070 ppm (137 μg/m3)  0.070 ppm (147 μg/m3)  Carbon monoxide (CO)  1-hour  20 ppm (23 mg/m3)  35 ppm (40 mg/m3)  Same as primary standard  8-hour  LTAB 6 ppm6 (7 mg/m3)  9 ppm (10 mg/m3)  Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) 7  Annual arithmetic mean  0.030 ppm (57 μg/m3)  53 ppb (100 μg/m3)  Same as primary standard  1-hour  0.18 ppm (339 μg/m3)  100 ppb (188 μg/m3)  –  Sulfur dioxide (SO2)  Annual arithmetic mean  –  0.030 ppm  –  24-hour  0.04 ppm (105 μg/m3)  0.14 ppm    3-hour  –  –  0.5 ppm (1300 μg/m3)  1-hour  0.25 ppm (655 μg/m3)  75 ppb (196 μg/m3)  –  Respirable particulate matter (PM10)  Annual arithmetic mean  20 μg/m3  –  Same as primary standard  24-hour  50 μg/m3  150 μg/m3  Fine particulate matter (PM2.5)  Annual arithmetic mean  12 μg/m3  12.0 μg/m3  15.0 μg/m3  24-hour  –  35 μg/m3  Lead 7  Calendar quarter  –  1.5 μg/m3  Same as primary standard  30-Day average  1.5 μg/m3  –  –    Rolling 3-Month Average  –  0.15 μg/m3  Same as primary standard  Hydrogen sulfide  1-hour  0.03 ppm (42 μg/m3)  No national standards  Sulfates  24-hour  25 μg/m3  Vinyl chloride 7  24-hour  0.01 ppm (26 μg/m3)  Visibility-reducing particulate matter  8-hour  Extinction of 0.23 per km statewide, and 0.07 per km in LTAB, respectively  Notes: µg/m3 = micrograms per cubic meter; km = kilometers; ppb = parts per billion; ppm = parts per million; LTAB = Lake Tahoe Air Basin 1 California standards for ozone, SO2 (1- and 24-hour), NO2, particulate matter, and visibility-reducing particles are values that are not to be exceeded. All others are not to be equaled or exceeded. California ambient air quality standards are listed in the Table of Standards in Section 70200 of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations. 2 Concentration expressed first in units in which it was issued. Equivalent units given in parentheses are based on a reference temperature of 25 degrees Celsius (°C) and a reference pressure of 760 torr. Most measurements of air quality are to be corrected to a reference temperature of 25°C and a reference pressure of 760 torr; ppm in this table refers to ppm by volume, or micromoles of pollutant per mole of gas.  3 National standards (other than ozone, particulate matter, and those based on annual averages or annual arithmetic means) are not to be exceeded more than once a year. The ozone standard is attained when the fourth highest 8-hour concentration in a year, averaged over 3 years, is equal to or less than the standard. The PM10 24-hour standard is attained when 99 percent of the daily concentrations, averaged over 3 years, are equal to or less than the standard. The PM2.5 24-hour standard is attained when 98 percent of the daily concentrations, averaged over 3 years, are equal to or less than the standard.  4 National primary standards: The levels of air quality necessary, with an adequate margin of safety, to protect the public health. 5 National secondary standards: The levels of air quality necessary to protect the public welfare from any known or anticipated adverse effects of a pollutant.  6 Applicable in the Lake Tahoe Air Basin. 7 The California Air Resources Board has identified lead and vinyl chloride as toxic air contaminants with no threshold of exposure for adverse health effects determined. These actions allow for the implementation of control measures at levels below the ambient concentrations specified for these pollutants. Sources: ARB 2016, EPA 2016a   Table 3.13-2 NAAQS/CAAQS Attainment Status of the Lake Tahoe Air Basin  Pollutant  State  Federal  O3: 1-hour  Transitional Nonattainment  Not Applicable  O3: 8-hour  Attainment  Attainment  CO  Attainment  Attainment/Maintenance  NO2  Attainment  Not Applicable  SO2  Attainment  Attainment  Lead  Attainment  Not Applicable  PM10  Nonattainment  Attainment  PM2.5  Not Applicable  Attainment/Unclassified  All others  Attainment/Unclassified  Attainment/Unclassified  Notes: CO = carbon monoxide; NO2 = nitrogen dioxide; O3 = ozone; PM2.5 = particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter; PM10 = particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter; SO2 = sulfur dioxide Source: ARB 2015 and EPA 2016b  In addition, general conformity requirements were adopted by Congress as part of the CAAA and were implemented by EPA regulations in 1993, which were amended most recently in 2010. General conformity requires that all federal actions conform to the SIP as approved or promulgated by EPA. The purpose of the general conformity program is to ensure that actions taken by the federal government do not undermine state or local efforts to achieve and maintain NAAQS. Before a federal action is taken, it must be evaluated for conformity with the SIP. All reasonably foreseeable emissions, both direct and indirect, that are predicted to result from the action are taken into consideration. The location and quantity of emissions must be identified. If it is found that the action would create emissions above de minimus levels specified in EPA regulations, the action cannot proceed unless mitigation measures are specified that would bring the project into conformance. Regional conformity is concerned with how well the regional transportation system supports plans for attaining the NAAQS for CO, NO2, O3, PM10 and PM2.5, and in some areas (although not in California), SO2. California has nonattainment or maintenance areas for all of these transportation-related “criteria pollutants” except SO2, and also has a nonattainment area for lead (Pb); however, lead is not currently required by the CAA to be covered in transportation conformity analysis. Regional conformity is based on the emission analysis of Regional Transportation Plans (RTPs) and Federal Transportation Improvement Programs (FTIPs) that include all transportation projects planned for a region over a period of at least 20 years for the RTP, and 4 years for the FTIP. RTP and FTIP conformity uses travel demand and emission models to determine whether or not the implementation of those projects would conform to emission budgets or other tests at various analysis years showing that requirements of the CAA and the SIP are met. If the conformity analysis is successful, the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and Federal Transit Administration (FTA), make determinations that the RTP and FTIP are in conformity with the SIP for achieving the goals of the CAA. Otherwise, the projects in the RTP and/or FTIP must be modified until conformity is attained. If the design concept, scope, and “open-to-traffic” schedule of a proposed transportation project is the same as described in the RTP and FTIP, then the project meets regional conformity requirements for purposes of project-level analysis. Conformity analysis at the project-level includes verification that the project is included in the regional conformity analysis and a “hot-spot” analysis if an area is “nonattainment” or “maintenance” for CO and/or particulate matter (PM10 or PM2.5). A region is “nonattainment” if one or more of the monitoring stations in the region measures a violation of the relevant standard and EPA officially designates the area nonattainment. Areas that were previously designated as nonattainment areas but subsequently meet the standard may be officially re-designated to attainment by EPA, and are then called “maintenance” areas. “Hot-spot” analysis is essentially the same, for technical purposes, as CO or particulate matter analysis performed for NEPA purposes. Conformity does include some specific procedural and documentation standards for projects that require a hot-spot analysis. In general, projects must not cause the “hot-spot”-related standard to be violated, and must not cause any increase in the number and severity of violations in nonattainment areas. If a known CO or particulate matter violation is located in the project vicinity, the project must include measures to reduce or eliminate the existing violation(s) as well. Hazardous Air Pollutants, Mobile Source Air Toxics, and Toxic Air Contaminants EPA and ARB regulate hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) and toxic air contaminants (TAC), respectively, through statutes and regulations that generally require the use of the maximum available control technology (MACT) or best available control technology (BACT) for TAC to limit emissions.  EPA has programs for identifying and regulating HAPs. Title III of the CAA directed EPA to promulgate national emissions standards for HAPs (NESHAP). The national emissions standards for HAPs may differ for major sources and for area sources of HAPs. Major sources are defined as stationary sources with potential to emit more than 10 tons per year (TPY) of any HAP or more than 25 TPY of any combination of HAPs; all other sources are considered area sources. The emissions standards are to be promulgated in two ways. First, EPA has technology-based emission standards designed to produce the maximum emission reduction achievable. These standards are generally referred to as requiring maximum available control technology for toxics. For area sources, the standards may be different, based on generally available control technology. Second, EPA also has health risk–based emissions standards, where deemed necessary, to address risks remaining after implementation of the technology-based NESHAP standards. Controlling air toxic emissions became a national priority with the passage of the CAA Amendments of 1990, whereby Congress mandated that the EPA regulate 188 air toxics. The EPA has assessed this expansive list in their latest rule on the Control of Hazardous Air Pollutants from Mobile Sources (also known as Mobile Source Air Toxics Rule, Federal Register, Vol. 72, No. 37, page 8430, February 26, 2007) and identified a group of 93 compounds emitted from mobile sources that are listed in their Integrated Risk Information System. In addition, the EPA identified seven compounds with significant contributions from mobile sources that are among the national and regional-scale cancer risk drivers from their 1999 National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA). These are acrolein, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, diesel particulate matter plus diesel exhaust organic gases (diesel PM), formaldehyde, naphthalene, and polycyclic organic matter. While the FHWA considers these seven compounds to be the priority mobile source air toxics, the list is subject to change and may be adjusted in consideration of future EPA rules. Collectively, these seven compounds are referred to as mobile source air toxics (MSAT).  In addition to the Mobile Source Air Toxics Rule discussed above, other standards expected to impact MSAT emissions include Tier 3 emissions and fuel standards starting in 2017 (79 FR 60344), heavy-duty greenhouse gas regulations that phase in during model years 2014-2018 (79 FR 60344), and the second phase of light duty greenhouse gas regulations that phase in during model years 2017-2025 (79 FR 60344). Federal Highway Administration On October 18, 2016, FHWA published the Updated Interim Guidance on Mobile Source Air Toxic Analysis in NEPA Documents, which supersedes previous guidance. This Updated Interim Guidance incorporates new analysis conducted using updated Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES2014a). The Updated Interim Guidance provides an update on the status of scientific research on air toxic and provides recommendations for discussion and content to be included in MSAT analyses for NEPA documentation. Specific FHWA guidance is included below in the Methods and Assumptions section. TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY The TRPA Regional Plan includes the following elements related to air quality: Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities adopted in 1982 and evaluated every 5 years since 1991 (TRPA 2012a); Goals and Policies (Air Quality Subelement); and the TRPA Code of Ordinances.  Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities In August 1982, TRPA adopted Resolution No. 82-11, which included Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities (threshold standards) related to air quality and other resource topics for the Lake Tahoe Region. TRPA conducts a comprehensive evaluation every 5 years to determine whether each threshold standard is being achieved and/or maintained, makes specific recommendations to address problem areas, and directs general planning efforts for the next 4-year period. The most recent evaluation was completed in 2016 (TRPA 2016). TRPA threshold standards address CO, ozone, regional and sub-regional visibility, and nitrate deposition. Numerical standards have been established for each of these parameters, and management standards have been developed that are intended to assist in attaining the threshold standards. The management standards include reducing particulate matter, maintaining levels of nitrogen oxides (NOX), reducing traffic volumes on US 50, and reducing vehicle miles of travel (VMT). These threshold standards and associated management standards are described in more detail below. In addition, the TRPA Compact between California and Nevada states that the Regional Plan shall provide for attaining and maintaining federal, state, or local air quality standards, whichever are strictest, in the respective portions of the region for which the standards are applicable. Attainment status and trends of each air quality indicator reporting categories are summarized in Table 3.13-3. Applicable threshold standards are summarized below. AQ-1, Carbon Monoxide  Numerical Standard: Maintain CO concentrations at or below 6 parts per million (ppm) averaged over 8 hours.  Management Standard: Reduce traffic volumes on the US 50 corridor by 7 percent during the winter from the 1981 base year between 4:00 p.m. and 12:00 midnight, provided that those traffic volumes shall be amended as necessary to meet the respective state standards. AQ-2, Ozone  Numerical Standard: Maintain ozone concentration below 0.08 ppm averaged over 1 hour.  Numerical Standard: Maintain NOX emissions at or below the 1981 level. AQ-3, Visibility  Numerical Standards:  Achieve an extinction coefficient of 25 inverse mega meters (Mm-1) at least 50 percent of the time as calculated from aerosol species concentrations measured at the Bliss State Park monitoring site (visual range of 156 kilometers, 97 miles).  Achieve an extinction coefficient of 34 Mm-1 at least 90 percent of the time as calculated from aerosol species concentrations measured at the Bliss State Park monitoring site (visual range of 115 kilometers, 71 miles).

The Land Use Element (Chapter 4) of the Goals and Policies document consists of seven subelements, one of which is the Air Quality Subelement, with a goal to attain and maintain air quality at healthy levels (Goal AQ-1). This goal is to be accomplished in several ways such as to reduce or limit sources of pollutants that degrade visibility (Policy AQ-1.2), encourage the reduction of emissions from vehicles and motorized machinery (Policy AQ-1.3), promote the reduction of air quality impacts from construction (Policy AQ-1.7). The full text of these goals and policies, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with the goals and policies, is included in Appendix E, “Land Use Policy Consistency Table.”  Table 3.13-3 TRPA Air Quality Indicator Attainment Status and Trends  Threshold Indicator Reporting Category   1991 Attainment Status  1996 Attainment Status  2001 Attainment Status  2006 Attainment Status  Threshold Standards1  2011 Attainment Status2  2015 Attainment Status  Trend  Carbon monoxide (CO)  Non-attainment  Attainment  Attainment  Non-attainment  Highest 1-hour Concentration of Carbon Monoxide  Considerably better than target  Considerably better than target  Moderate improvement  Highest 8-hour Average Concentration of Carbon Monoxide  Considerably better than target  Considerably better than target  Moderate improvement  Average Daily Winter Traffic Volume, Presidents Weekend  At or somewhat better than target  Considerably better than target  Moderate improvement  Ozone  Non-attainment  Non-attainment  Non-attainment  Non-attainment  Highest 1-hour Average Concentration of Ozone  At or somewhat better than target  At or somewhat better than target  Moderate improvement  Highest 8-hour Average Concentration of Ozone  At or somewhat better than target  Somewhat worse than target  Moderate improvement  3 Year Average of the 4th Highest 8-hour Concentration of Ozone  At or somewhat better than target  At or somewhat better than target  Moderate improvement  Oxides of Nitrogen Emissions  At or somewhat better than target  Considerably better than target  Moderate improvement  Visibility  Attainment  Non-attainment  Non-attainment  Attainment  Regional Visibility  Regional Visibility 50th Percentile (“Average Visibility Days”)  At or somewhat better than target  At or somewhat better than target  Little or no change  Regional Visibility 90th Percentile (“Worst Visibility Days”)  At or somewhat better than target  At or somewhat better than target  Little or no change  Subregional Visibility  Subregional Visibility 50th Percentile (“Average Visibility Days”)  Insufficient data to determine status  Insufficient data to determine status  Insufficient data to determine trend  Subregional Visibility 90th Percentile (“Worst Visibility Days”)  Insufficient data to determine status  Insufficient data to determine status  Insufficient data to determine trend  Particulate matter  Non-attainment  Non-attainment  Attainment  Non-attainment  Highest 24-hour PM10 Concentration  Somewhat worse than target  Somewhat worse than target  Little or no change  Annual Average PM10 Concentration  Insufficient data to determine status  Considerably better than target  Moderate improvement  24-hour PM2.5 Concentration  Considerably better than target  At or somewhat better than target  Little or no change  Annual Average PM2.5 Concentration  Considerably better than target  Considerably better than target  Little or no change  Nitrate deposition  Unknown  Unknown  Unknown  Unknown  Reduce generation and transport of nitrate to achieve water quality standards  Implemented3  Implemented3  Unknown  Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)  At or somewhat better than target  At or somewhat better than target  Moderate improvement  Odor  No Designation  No Designation  No Designation  No Designation  Reduce diesel engine fumes  Implemented3  Implemented3  Unknown  Notes:  1 In the 2015 Threshold Evaluation, attainment status was no longer provided for the Threshold Indicator Reporting Category and instead was provided for each threshold standard; therefore, attainment status is provided for each threshold standard for the 2011 Threshold Evaluation and 2015 Threshold Evaluation as a basis of comparison. 2 Change in terminology occurred in 2011 Threshold Evaluation. 3 “Implemented” refers to implementation of a management standard rather than monitoring the achievement of a numerical standard.  Source: TRPA 2007:2-8; TRPA 2016:3-8 – 3-9  TRPA has jurisdiction within the LTAB portion of El Dorado County and Douglas County in regard to air quality. Therefore, the Air Quality Subelement of the Goals and Policies document has focused on achieving the NAAQS and CAAQS, as well as special TRPA-adopted regional and sub-regional visibility standards, and on reducing the deposition of nitrate from NOX emitted by vehicles. The TRPA Code and the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) contain specific measures designed to monitor and achieve the air quality objectives of the Regional Plan.  Code of Ordinances Applicable provisions of Chapter 65 (Air Quality and Transportation) of the TRPA Code (TRPA 2012b) are described below. Chapter 65.1—Air Quality Control The provisions of Chapter 65.1 apply to direct sources of air pollution in the Tahoe Region, including certain motor vehicles registered in the region, combustion heaters installed in the region, open burning and stationary sources of air pollution, and idling combustion engines. Provisions potentially applicable to the project are provided below.  Section 65.1.3, “Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program,” states that to avoid duplication of effort in implementation of an inspection/maintenance program for certain vehicles registered in the CO nonattainment area, TRPA shall work with the affected state agencies to plan for applying state inspection/maintenance programs to the Tahoe Region.  Section 65.1.8, “Idling Restrictions,” states that no person shall cause a combustion engine in a parked auto, truck, bus, or boat to idle for more than 30 consecutive minutes in the designated plan areas (with limited exemptions).  Mobility 2035: Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan In 2012, the Tahoe Metropolitan Planning Organization (TMPO) prepared the Mobility 2035: Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), which seeks to improve mobility and safety for the commuting public while at the same time delivering environmental improvements throughout the transportation network in the Tahoe Basin. Important directions of the plan are to reduce the overall environmental impact of transportation in the Tahoe Region, create walkable, vibrant communities, and provide real alternatives to driving. The plan also supported an update of the Transportation Element of the TRPA) Regional Plan. Finally, the plan met the challenge of California’s Senate Bill 375 by presenting an integrated land use and transportation strategy that will allow the Tahoe Region to achieve targets for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2035.  The 2017 Regional Transportation Plan (2017 RTP), which is an update to the 2012 RTP, and its joint CEQA/TRPA environmental document have been circulated for public review. The vision and goals of the 2017 RTP were based on the 2012 RTP. The projects listed in the 2017 RTP are substantially similar to those in the 2012 RTP, and the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project is included in both documents. Although the draft 2017 RTP has been released for public review, and includes the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project, the 2012 RTP/SCS is the currently adopted plan. Because an initial study/initial environmental checklist (IS/IEC) has been prepared for the 2017 RTP as a supplement to the RTP/SCS Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement (EIR/EIS) and does not result in new significant environmental impacts, the analysis below continues to rely on the 2012 RTP/SCS EIR/EIS. Area Plans The project site is within the Tourist Core Area Plan (TCAP) and the South Shore Area Plan (SSAP). The TCAP includes a goal to reduce air emissions in the Tourist Core (Goal NCR-5 Air Quality) and a policy to achieve this goal that requires implementation of dust and exhaust emissions controls for construction projects (Policy NCR-5.1). The South Shore Area Plan does not have specific goals or policies in place for reducing air quality but does acknowledge the importance of maintaining healthy air quality in the plan area.  Construction Practices Policy for Construction Emissions TRPA coordinates implementation of its Best Construction Practices Policy for Construction Emissions through TRPA-approved plans, project-permitting, or projects/programs developed in coordination with local or other governments that require, as a condition of project approval, implementation of feasible measures and best management practices (BMPs) to reduce construction-generated emissions to the extent feasible. TRPA developed its Best Construction Practices Policy (approved by the TRPA Governing Board on November 13, 2013) pursuant to Mitigation Measure 3.4-2 of the RTP EIR/EIS and Mitigation Measure 3.4-2 of the Regional Plan Update EIS.  TRPA’s Best Construction Practices Policy for Construction Emissions includes the following measures applicable to the project (TRPA 2013):  Fugitive dust shall not exceed 40 percent opacity and not go beyond the property boundary at any time during project construction.  No open burning of removed vegetation shall occur during infrastructure improvements.  Minimize idling time to 5 minutes in California and 15 minutes in Nevada for all diesel-power equipment (refer to TRPA Code Section 65.1.8, “Idling Restrictions,” for all idling restrictions).   Apply water to control dust as needed to prevent dust impacts offsite. Operational water truck(s) shall be onsite, as required, to control fugitive dust. Construction vehicles leaving the site shall be cleaned to prevent dust, silt, mud, and dirt from being released or tracked offsite.   Apply approved chemical soil stabilizers, vegetative mats, or other appropriate BMPs to manufacturer’s specifications, to all inactive construction areas (previously graded areas which remain inactive for 96 hours). Spread soil binders on unpaved roads and employee/equipment parking areas and wet broom or wash streets if silt is carried over to adjacent public thoroughfares.  Utilize existing power sources (e.g., power poles) or clean-fuel generators rather than temporary diesel power generators, wherever feasible. STATE  California ARB is the agency responsible for coordination and oversight of state and local air pollution control programs in California and for implementing the California Clean Air Act (CCAA). California law authorizes ARB to set ambient (outdoor) air pollution standards (California Health and Safety Code Section 39606) in consideration of public health, safety, and welfare (California Ambient Air Quality Standards [CAAQS]; Table 3.13-1). Criteria Air Pollutants ARB has established CAAQS for sulfates, hydrogen sulfide, vinyl chloride, visibility-reducing particulate matter, and the above-mentioned criteria air pollutants. In most cases the CAAQS are more stringent than the NAAQS. Differences in the standards are generally explained by the health effects studies considered during the standard-setting process and the interpretation of the studies. In addition, the CAAQS incorporate a margin of safety to protect sensitive individuals. The CCAA requires that all local air districts in the state endeavor to achieve and maintain the CAAQS by the earliest date practical. The act specifies that local air districts should focus particular attention on reducing the emissions from transportation and area wide emission sources, and provides districts with the authority to regulate indirect sources.   Among ARB’s other responsibilities are overseeing local air district compliance with federal and state laws, approving local air quality plans, submitting SIPs to EPA, monitoring air quality, determining and updating area designations and maps, and setting emissions standards for new mobile sources, consumer products, small utility engines, off-road vehicles, and fuels.  Toxic Air Contaminants TACs in California are regulated primarily through the Tanner Air Toxics Act (Assembly Bill [AB] 1807, Chapter 1047, Statutes of 1983) and the Air Toxics Hot Spots Information and Assessment Act of 1987 (AB 2588, Chapter 1252, Statutes of 1987). AB 1807 sets forth a formal procedure for ARB to designate substances as TACs. Research, public participation, and scientific peer review are required before ARB can designate a substance as a TAC. To date, ARB has identified more than 21 TACs, including diesel PM, and adopted EPA’s list of HAPs as TACs.  Once a TAC is identified, ARB then adopts an airborne toxics control measure for sources that emit that particular TAC. If a safe threshold exists for a substance at which there is no toxic effect, the control measure must reduce exposure below that threshold. If no safe threshold exists, the measure must incorporate BACT for toxics to minimize emissions.  ARB has adopted diesel exhaust control measures and more stringent emission standards for various on-road mobile sources of emissions, including transit buses, and off-road diesel equipment (e.g., tractors, generators). Recent milestones included the low-sulfur diesel fuel requirement and tighter emissions standards for heavy-duty diesel trucks (effective in 2007 and subsequent model years) and off-road diesel equipment (2011). Over time, replacing older vehicles will result in a vehicle fleet that produces substantially lower levels of TACs than under current conditions. Mobile-source emissions of TACs (e.g., benzene, 1-3-butadiene, diesel PM) in California have been reduced substantially over the last decade; such emissions will be reduced further through a progression of regulatory measures (e.g., low emission vehicle/clean fuels and Phase II reformulated-gasoline regulations) and control technologies. The Hot Spots Act requires that existing facilities that emit toxic substances above a specified level prepare an inventory of toxic emissions, prepare a risk assessment if emissions are significant, notify the public of significant risk levels, and prepare and implement risk reduction measures. Nevada At the state level, the Nevada BAPC and BAQP are the agencies responsible for coordination and oversight of state air pollution control programs, including the Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP), and air quality surveillance in Nevada. The authority for the BAPC and BAQP to implement air pollution control programs is drawn from the Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 445B.100 through 445B.825 and 486A.010 through 486A.180. The agencies achieve and maintain air quality conditions in Douglas County through a comprehensive program of planning, regulation, enforcement, technical innovation, and promotion of the understanding of air‐quality issues.  The clean air strategy of the BAPC and BAQP includes the preparation of plans and programs for the attainment of ambient air quality standards, adoption and enforcement of rules and regulations, and issuance of permits for stationary sources. The BAPC and BAQP also oversee compliance with Nevada and federal laws; prepare SIPs; conduct inspections; observe and review source test data, excess emission reports, and compliance certification reports; investigate air quality complaints; operate an ambient air quality monitoring network; develop and implement strategies to control air pollution from motor vehicles, convert motor vehicle fleets to use cleaner‐burning alternative fuels; and coordinate and facilitate prescribed outdoor burning.  LOCAL El Dorado County Air Quality Management District Criteria Air Pollutants EDCAQMD attains and maintains air quality conditions in El Dorado County through a comprehensive program of planning, regulation, enforcement, technical innovation, and promotion of the understanding of air quality issues. The clean-air strategy of EDCAQMD includes preparing plans for the attainment of ambient air quality standards, adopting and enforcing rules and regulations concerning sources of air pollution, and issuing permits for stationary sources of air pollution. EDCAQMD also inspects stationary sources of air pollution and responds to citizen complaints, monitors ambient air quality and meteorological conditions, and implements programs and regulations required by the CAA, CAAA, and CCAA.  All projects in El Dorado County, including those in the City of South Lake Tahoe, are subject to adopted EDCAQMD rules and regulations in effect at the time of construction. Specific EDCAQMD rules applicable to the construction of the project may include but are not limited to the following:  Rule 202—Visible Emissions,  Rule 215—Application of Architectural Coatings,  Rule 223-1—Fugitive Dust,   Rule 223-2—Asbestos,  Rule 224—Cutback and Emulsified Asphalt Paving Materials, and  Rule 501—Permit Requirements.  Specifically, Rule 223-1 establishes standards to be met by project activities generating fugitive dust. It applies to all of El Dorado County and addresses fugitive dust generated by construction and grading activities, and by other land uses including recreation uses. Among the standards to be met is a prohibition on visible dust crossing the property boundary, generation of high levels of visible dust (dust sufficient to obscure vision by 40 percent), and controls on the track-out of dirt and mud on to public roads. The regulation also establishes minimum dust mitigation and control requirements. When an area to be disturbed is greater than 1 acre, and if required by a project condition of approval or discretionary permit, a dust control plan must be submitted to and approved by EDCAQMD before any construction activities. Further, Rule 223-2 requires activities to reduce asbestos dust created from earth moving activities. Toxic Air Contaminants At the local level, air districts may adopt and enforce ARB’s airborne toxic control measures. Under EDCAQMD Rule 501 (“Permit Requirements”), EDCAQMD Rule 523 (“New Source Review”), and EDCAQMD Rule 522, (“Federal Operating Permit”) all sources that have the potential to emit TACs are required to obtain permits from the district. Permits may be granted to these operations if they are constructed and operated in accordance with applicable regulations, including new source review standards and air toxics control measures. EDCAQMD limits emissions and public exposure to TACs through a number of programs.  City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan The City of South Lake Tahoe adopted the 2030 General Plan on May 17, 2011. The Natural and Cultural Resources Element of the General Plan provides city-wide goals and polices aimed at improving air quality (City of South Lake Tahoe 2011) that are applicable to the build alternatives, including a goal to incorporate air quality improvements and emission reductions directly with land use and transportation planning (Goal NCR-5) and a policy to incorporate mitigation for projects that have significant construction emissions (Policy NCR-5.10). The full text of this goal and policy, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with this goal and policy, is included in Appendix E, “Land Use Policy Consistency Table.” Douglas County Master Plan Douglas County adopted a twenty-year Master Plan in 1996. The Master Plan, or Comprehensive Plan, is required by Nevada Revised Statutes (Chapter 278.150) for the purpose of providing long-term guidance on the development of cities, counties, and regions in Nevada. The 15 Year Update of the Douglas County Master Plan (2011) was adopted by the Douglas County Board of Commissioners on March 1, 2012.  The Environmental Resources and Conservation Element of the plan includes goals and policies/actions aimed at improving air quality within the County, including a goal to maintain and improve existing air quality (ERC Goal 13) and an action to establish standards for roadway surfacing and maintenance which reduces dust generation (ERC Action 13.3). A discussion of the project’s consistency with this goal and policy, is included in Appendix E, “Land Use Policy Consistency Table.” 3.13.2 Affected Environment The project site and study area are located in the LTAB. The LTAB comprises portions of El Dorado and Placer counties on the California side of the Lake Tahoe Basin, and Washoe County, Douglas County, and the Carson City Rural District on the Nevada side.  Ambient concentrations of air pollutants are determined by the amount of pollutants emitted and the atmosphere’s ability to transport and dilute such emissions. Natural factors that affect transport and dilution include terrain, wind, atmospheric stability, and the presence of sunlight. Therefore, existing air quality conditions in the LTAB are determined by such natural factors as climate, meteorology, and topography, in addition to the level of emissions released by existing air pollutant sources. These factors are discussed separately below. CLIMATE, METEOROLOGY, AND TOPOGRAPHY Lake Tahoe lies in a topographic depression between the crests of the Sierra Nevada and Carson ranges on the California-Nevada border at a surface elevation of approximately 6,260 feet above mean sea level. The LTAB is defined by the 7,000-foot contour, which is continuous around the Lake, except near Tahoe City. The mountains surrounding the Lake are approximately 8,000 to 9,000 feet in height on average, with some reaching 10,000 feet.  Pollutants from local sources are trapped by frequent inversions in the LTAB, greatly limiting the volume of air into which the pollutants are mixed (e.g., diluted), which results in accumulation and elevated concentrations of pollutants. A second important meteorological regime is the transport of pollutants from the Sacramento Valley and San Francisco Bay Area because winds from these areas move upslope in the Sierra Nevada and the Lake is located directly east of the Sierra Nevada crest (Cahill and Cliff 2000:1). The project site generally experiences warm, dry summers and wet, snowy winters. Maximum temperatures occur during July and reach 78 degrees Fahrenheit on average. Minimum temperatures can be as low as 23 degrees Fahrenheit during winter months (WRCC 2016a). Average annual precipitation of approximately 12.9 inches (63.5 inches of snowfall) occurs primarily during the months of November through March and average annual wind speed is 6.1 miles per hour from the south in South Lake Tahoe (WRCC 2016b). CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS Concentrations of emissions from criteria air pollutants are used to indicate the quality of the ambient air. A brief description of key criteria air pollutants is provided below, including emission source types and health effects. For descriptions of health effects, “acute” refers to effects of short-term exposures to criteria air pollutants, usually at fairly high concentrations whereas “chronic” refers to effects of long-term exposures to criteria air pollutants, usually at lower, ambient concentrations. Ozone Ozone is a photochemical oxidant (a molecule whose oxygen combines chemically with another substance in the presence of sunlight) and the primary component of smog. Ozone is not directly emitted into the air but is formed through complex chemical reactions between precursor emissions of ROG and NOX in the presence of sunlight. ROG are volatile organic compounds that are photochemically reactive. ROG emissions result primarily from incomplete combustion and the evaporation of chemical solvents and fuels. NOX are a group of gaseous compounds of nitrogen and oxygen that result from the combustion of fuels (EPA 2016c).  Emissions of the ozone precursors ROG and NOX have decreased in California over the past several years because of more stringent motor vehicle standards and cleaner burning fuels. Emissions of ROG and NOX decreased from 2000 to 2010 and are projected to continue decreasing from 2010 to 2035 (ARB 2014). Acute health effects include cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, and throat/airway inflammation. Chronic health effects include reduced lung function, worsening of existing condition such as bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma (EPA 2016c). Carbon Monoxide CO is a colorless, odorless gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuels (i.e., motor vehicle exhaust). Acute health effects include headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and eventually death. Chronic health effects include permanent heart and brain damage (EPA 2016c). Nitrogen Dioxide Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of a group of highly reactive gases known as oxides of nitrogen or nitrogen oxides (NOX). NO2 primarily gets in the air from the burning of fuel. NO2 forms from emissions from cars, trucks and buses, power plants, and off-road equipment (EPA 2016c). Acute health effects include respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, leading to respiratory symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, or difficulty breathing. Chronic health effects include development of asthma and potential increased susceptibility to respiratory infection (EPA 2016c). Sulfur Dioxide Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is gaseous compound of sulfur and oxygen. Sources of SO2 include coal and oil combustion, refineries, and other processes such as extracting metal from ore Acute health effects include irritation of upper respiratory tract and difficulty breathing (EPA 2016c).  Particulate Matter Particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 micrometers or less is referred to as PM10. This size particle is of concern because it is small enough to reach deep into the lungs. PM10 consists of particulate matter emitted directly into the air, such as fugitive dust, soot, and smoke from mobile and stationary sources, construction operations, fires and natural windblown dust, and particulate matter formed in the atmosphere by reaction of gaseous precursors (ARB 2014). PM2.5 includes a subgroup of smaller particles that have an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less. PM10 and PM2.5 emissions are dominated by emissions from area sources, primarily fugitive dust from vehicle travel on unpaved and paved roads, farming operations, construction and demolition, and particles from residential fuel combustion (ARB 2014). Direct emissions of PM10 in California have increased slightly over the last 20 years, and are projected to continue to increase slightly through 2035 (ARB 2014:3-7). PM2.5 emissions have remained relatively steady over the last 20 years and are projected to decrease slightly through 2035 (ARB 2014:3-6). Acute health risks include breathing and respiratory symptoms, aggravation of existing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and premature death. Chronic effects include alterations to the immune system and cancer formation. MONITORING STATION DATA Concentrations of criteria air pollutants are measured at several monitoring stations near the project site. The Echo Summit Station in Nebelhorn, located approximately 11 miles to the southwest, is the closest monitoring station to the project site with recent data for ozone. The nearest monitoring station with recent data for PM10 is the South Lake Tahoe-Sandy Way station, which is located approximately 2 miles to the west of the project site. In general, the measurements of ambient air quality from the monitoring stations at the Echo Summit Station, Truckee Station, and South Lake Tahoe Station are the most representative of the air quality at the project site. Table 3.13-4 summarizes the air quality data from these stations from 2011 through 2014.  Table 3.13-4 Summary of Annual Air Quality Data (2011–2014)  Ozone 1  2011  2012  2013  2014  Maximum concentration (1-hour/8-hour, ppm)  0.108/0.071  0.084/0.077  0.082/0.076  0.081/0.072  Number of days state standard exceeded (1-hour/8-hour)  1/1  0/11  0/1  0/2  Number of days national standard exceeded (8-hour)  0  1  0  0  Respirable Particulate Matter (PM10) 2  2011  2012  2013  2014  Maximum Concentration (μg/m3)   55.8  84.1  139.3  58.6  Number of days state standard exceeded (measured 3)  3  4  4  2  Number of days national standard exceeded (measured 3)  *  *  *  0  Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5) 4  2011  2012  2013  2014  Maximum Concentration (μg/m3)   68.9  27.5  61.2  253.0  Annual Average (μg/m3)   *  11.0  *  14.3  Number of days national standard exceeded (measured 3)  0  0  0  0  Notes: g/m3 = micrograms per cubic meter; ppm = parts per million; * = Insufficient data to determine the value; N/A = not available 1 Data from the Echo Summit Station in Nebelhorn. 2 Data from the South Lake Tahoe – Sandy Way Station. 3  Measured days are those days that an actual measurement was greater than the level of the state daily standard or the national daily standard.

Existing conditions with regards to CO are characterized in TRPA’s 2015 Threshold Evaluation (TRPA 2016). The threshold evaluation uses three separate indicators to evaluate CO in the LTAB—the 1-hour CAAQS of 20 ppm; the 8-hour CAAQS of 6 ppm; and winter traffic volumes. The LTAB has been in compliance with the 1- and 8-hour CAAQSs since 1983 and 2003, respectively. The most recent threshold evaluation determined that the 1- and 8-hour CAAQS are “considerably better than target” and continuing to improve moderately with a moderate level of confidence. It also determined that winter traffic volumes are “considerately better than target” and this indicator has had “moderate improvement” since 1980 with a moderate level of confidence.  The EPA and ARB use monitoring data, such as that provided in Table 3.13-4, to designate areas according to their attainment status for criteria air pollutants. The purpose of these designations is to identify those areas with air quality problems and thereby initiate planning efforts for improvement. The three basic designation categories are “nonattainment,” “attainment,” and “unclassified.” “Unclassified” is used in areas that cannot be classified on the basis of available information as meeting or not meeting the standards. The current national and state attainment designations for the LTAB are shown above in Table 3.13-2 for each criteria air pollutant. Ambient air quality standards define clean air and are established to protect even the most sensitive individuals in communities. An air quality standard defines the maximum amount of a pollutant that can be present in outdoor air without harm to public health.  TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS Concentrations of TACs are also used to indicate the quality of ambient air. A TAC is an air pollutant that may cause or contribute to an increase in mortality or in serious illness, or that may pose a hazard to human health. TACs are usually present in trace quantities in the ambient air; however, their high toxicity or health risk may pose a threat to public health even at low concentrations. According to the California Almanac of Emissions and Air Quality (ARB 2014), the majority of the estimated health risks from TACs can be attributed to relatively few compounds, the most important being diesel PM. Diesel PM differs from other TACs in that it is not a single substance, but rather a complex mixture of hundreds of substances. Although diesel PM is emitted by diesel-fueled internal combustion engines, the composition of the emissions varies depending on engine type, operating conditions, fuel composition, lubricating oil, and whether an emissions control system is being used.  Sources of TACs vary considerably and include (but are not limited to) consumer products, gasoline dispensing stations, auto repair and auto body coating shops, dry cleaning establishments, chrome plating and anodizing shops, welding operations, and other stationary sources. Major sources of TACs in the vicinity of the project site are highways and roadways associated with the presence of diesel PM emissions from vehicle exhaust. US 50 and other local roadways are the primary source of TACs in the study area.  The Mobile Source Air Toxics Rule includes new standards as of 2011 that will decrease MSAT emissions through nationwide use of cleaner fuels and engines. Specifically, fuel refiners must meet lower gasoline benzene and non-methane hydrocarbon content. As a result of these standards, passenger vehicles will emit 45 percent less benzene, a direct reduction in PM2.5 emissions. Based on emissions modeling conducted by FHWA, diesel PM is the dominant MSAT of concern for highway projects (FHWA 2016). SENSITIVE LAND USES Sensitive land uses are generally considered to include those uses where exposure to pollutants could result in health-related risks to individuals. Residential dwellings and places where people recreate or congregate for extended periods of time such as parks or schools are of primary concern because of the potential for increased and prolonged exposure of individuals to pollutants. Existing sensitive land uses near the project side include single family homes, multi-family homes, and vacation rentals in the area east of Pioneer Trail, west of Montreal Road, and south of the Village Center. The Bright Beginnings Preschool and Tahoe Douglas Christian Preschool are located approximately a half-mile from the northern end of the project site.  3.13.3 Environmental Consequences METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS Short-term construction-related emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursors were calculated using the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District’s (SMAQMD) Roadway Construction Emissions Model (Version 8.1.0), and the California Emissions Estimator Model (CalEEMod) Version 2016.3.1 computer program (California Air Pollution Control Officers Association [CAPCOA] 2016), as recommended by EDCAQMD and other air districts in California. Modeling was based on project-specific information (e.g., length of road, area to be graded, and area to be paved), where available; reasonable assumptions based on typical construction activities; and default values that are based on the project’s location and land use type. The modeling conservatively assumed that project construction/grading phases could begin as early as 2017 with final project completion for transportation improvements occurring by 2020. The potential redevelopment of the mixed-use development sites was conservatively assumed to occur simultaneously with the transportation improvements to evaluate maximum potential emissions. To model maximum construction emissions from the mixed-use sites, it was conservatively assumed that two of the three sites could be constructed simultaneously. For a detailed description of model input and output parameters and assumptions, refer to Appendix J. Operational-related emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursors was evaluated qualitatively by comparing the project to already adopted, applicable air quality plans in the region. The evaluation was based on information and traffic volumes available in the most recent traffic study completed for the project (Wood Rogers 2016). The potential for project-generated traffic to result in concentrations of CO that exceed the NAAQS and CAAQS for this pollutant was evaluated using EDCAQMD-recommended screening criteria. Because EDCAQMD has not developed conservative screening methods for CO, the potential for CO hot-spots was further evaluated using a quantitative screening method recommended by SMAQMD as described in Impact 3.13-3, below.  Health risk from project-generated, construction- and operation-related emissions of TACs were assessed qualitatively. This assessment is based on the location from which construction- or operation-related TAC emissions would be generated by land uses developed under the project relative to onsite sensitive receptors as subsequent phases are built, as well as the duration during which TAC exposure would occur. Guidance for MSAT/TACs analysis is available from numerous agencies. The FHWA published the Interim Guidance on Mobile Source Toxic Analysis in NEPA, with a recent update in October 2016. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) also uses the FHWA Guidance, with some minor tweaks, and ARB published the Air Quality and Land Use Handbook in 2005, which provides screening distances and general guidance for siting receptors near roadways or locating new roadways near receptors (ARB 2005). To evaluate operational impacts associated with build alternatives, project-generated traffic volumes were available from the traffic study conducted for the project (Wood Rogers 2016).  SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA NEPA Criteria An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the proposed actions in comparison to the no build alternative. Context means that the significance of the action must be considered in terms of the region as a whole, affected interests, and the specific locality. Intensity refers to the severity of an effect. Under NEPA, the significance of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects as compared to the no build alternative are based on available guidance from applicable regulatory agencies. With regards to MSAT analysis in NEPA documents, FHWA has developed a tiered approach, depending on specific project circumstances. The guidance is shown below.  Category 1: No analysis for projects with no potential for meaningful MSAT effects.  Projects qualifying as a categorical exclusion under Title 23 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Section 771.117(c);  Projects exempt under the CAA conformity rule under 40 CFR 93.126; or  Other projects with no meaningful impacts on traffic volumes or vehicle mix.  Category 2: Qualitative analysis for projects with low potential MSAT effects.  Projects that serve to improve operations of highway, transit, or freight without adding substantial new capacity or without creating a facility that is likely to meaningfully increase MSAT emissions.   Project examples include minor widening projects; new interchanges; replacing a signalized intersection on a surface street; or projects where design year traffic is projected to be less than 140,000 to 150,000 Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT).  Any projects not meeting the criteria in Category (1) or Category (3) should be included in this category.  Category 3: Projects with higher potential MSAT effects.  Create or significantly alter a major intermodal freight facility that has the potential to concentrate high levels of diesel PM in a single location, involving a significant number of diesel vehicles for new projects or accommodating with a significant increase in the number of diesel vehicles for expansion projects; or  Create new capacity or add significant capacity to urban highways such as interstates, urban arterials, or urban collector-distributor routes with traffic volumes where the AADT is projected to be in the range of 140,000 to 150,000 or greater by the design year; And also  Be proposed to be located in proximity to populated areas. TRPA Criteria The “Air Quality” criteria from the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist were used to evaluate the air quality impacts of the alternatives. The project would result in a significant impact if it would result in:   substantial air pollutant emissions;  deterioration of ambient (existing) air quality;  the creation of objectionable odors;  alteration of air movement, moisture or temperature, or any change in climate, either locally or regionally; or  increased use of diesel fuel. CEQA Criteria Based on Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines, an air quality impact is considered significant if implementation of the project would do any of the following:  conflict with or obstruct implementation of the applicable air quality plan;  violate any air quality standard or contribute substantially to an existing or projected air quality violation (Table 3.13-1);  result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria air pollutant for which the project region is in nonattainment under any applicable national or state ambient air quality standards (including releasing emissions that exceed quantitative standards for ozone precursors); or  expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations (including TACs/HAPs).  As stated in Appendix G, the significance criteria established by the applicable AQMD or air pollution control district (APCD) may be used to make the above determinations. Thus, as identified by EDCAQMD, an air quality impact also is considered significant if implementation of the project would:  result in a net increase in short-term construction-related or long-term operation-related (regional) emissions of ROG or NOX, that exceed mass emissions of 82 pounds per day (lb/day). Note that EDCAQMD does not have a threshold for exhaust PM10/PM2.5, but considers these emissions significant if ROG and NOX thresholds are exceeded;  not include construction-related dust control measures designed to prevent visible dust emissions beyond the property lines of the project site;  would result in CO emissions from construction or operation that exceeds CAAQS/NAAQS. EDCAQMD considers development projects of the type and size that fall below the significance thresholds for ROG and NOX to also be insignificant for CO emissions. Screening criteria established by SMAQMD that determined that traffic volumes at nearby intersections experiencing more than 31,600 vehicles per hour would result in CO impacts; or  expose sensitive receptors to TAC emissions that would exceed 10 in 1 million for the carcinogenic risk (i.e., the risk of contracting cancer) or a noncarcinogenic Hazard Index of 1 for the maximally-exposed individual; and/or in accordance with ARB, FHWA, and Caltrans guidance, would result in exposure to sensitive receptors to a roadway experiencing more than 100,000 ADT.  Although significance criteria have not been adopted by the state of Nevada air quality agencies or Douglas County, significance thresholds developed by EDCAQMD are intended to ensure compliance with CAAQS and NAAQAS. Further, emissions that do not exceed EDCAQMD-recommended thresholds would not be expected to contribute substantially to a violation of applicable ambient air quality standards. Therefore, it is appropriate to apply EDCAQMD significance thresholds to portions of the project located in Nevada. ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF THE PROJECT ALTERNATIVES Impact 3.13-1: Short-term, construction-generated emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursors Construction of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would not exceed EDCAQMD’s ROG threshold. Construction of Alternatives B, C, and D would exceed EDCAQMD’s NOX threshold, and therefore CO, exhaust PM10, and PM2.5 emissions could be significant. Construction of Alternative E would not exceed EDCAQMD’s NOX or ROG threshold and therefore exhaust emissions would not be significant. All build alternatives (Alternatives B through E) could result in excessive fugitive dust emissions.  In addition to construction associated with the transportation improvements, construction emissions related to the potential mixed-use development sites for Alternatives B, C, and D would also occur. The mixed-use development would begin prior to the transportation improvements in California but may occur simultaneously with transportation improvements occurring in Nevada. Emissions from the mixed-use developments were evaluated separately and in combination with the construction activities for the transportation improvements. Construction associated with redeveloping the mixed-use sites alone or in combination with the transportation improvements would not exceed EDCAQMD’s threshold for ROG. Construction associated with redeveloping the mixed-use sites alone and in combination with the transportation improvements would exceed EDCAQMD’s thresholds for NOX, and therefore CO, exhaust PM10, and PM2.5 could be significant. Excessive fugitive dust emissions could occur during construction of the mixed-use sites alone and in combination with the transportation improvements. NEPA Environmental Consequences: Mitigation Measures 3.13-1a and 3.13-1b have been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, D, and E to further reduce to the extent feasible short-term construction-generated emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursors; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, D, and E after implementation of Mitigation Measures 3.13-1a and 3.13-1b; No Impact for Alternative A Construction-related activities would result in project-generated emissions of ROG, NOX, CO, PM10, and PM2.5 from site preparation (e.g., excavation, grading, and clearing), off-road equipment, material delivery, worker commute exhaust emissions, vehicle travel, construction, asphalt paving, application of architectural coatings, and other miscellaneous activities. Fugitive dust emissions are associated primarily with site preparation and grading and vary as a function of soil silt content, soil moisture, wind speed, and area of disturbance. Ozone precursor emissions of ROG, NOX, and CO are associated primarily with exhaust from construction equipment, haul truck trips, and worker trips. ROG emissions are also generated during asphalt paving and the application of architectural coatings.  Construction of the transportation improvements are conservatively expected to be completed as early as 2020. For Alternatives B, C, and D demolition activities for right-of-way acquisition would occur before the US 50 realignment work and other improvements. A portion of the mixed-use development is expected to begin before the transportation improvements in California to accommodate the displaced residents. The remainder of the mixed-use development is expected to occur following completion of the transportation improvements. Alternative E would not result in any demolition of existing structures or the development of any new land uses. Construction-related emissions are discussed for all alternatives as it relates to the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, where applicable, below. Alternative A: No Build (No Project) With Alternative A there would be no improvements to existing US 50, Lake Parkway, or other roadways within the project site. There would be no demolition or construction, and no new land use development. Alternative A would not result in any emissions of criteria air pollutants or precursors. Thus, there would be no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements As described in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives,” Alternative B would include realignment of US 50, demolition of existing structures within the right-of-way of the proposed highway realignment, construction of an approximate 76-foot pedestrian bridge above the realigned US 50 alignment connecting the tourist core to Van Sickle Bi-State Park, and various bicycle and pedestrian facilities such as bicycle lanes and sidewalks. The maximum daily emissions associated with the construction of the transportation improvements were modeled and are shown below in Table 3.13-5. Table 3.13-5 Maximum Daily Construction Emissions (lb/day) Associated with the Transportation improvements (Alternatives B, C, and D)  Construction Activity  ROG  NOX  PM10  PM2.5  CO  Demolition  1.5  17.7  4.9  1.4  10.6  Grubbing/Land Clearing  1.7  19.3  50.9  11.2  12.3  Grading/Excavation  8.5  93.1  54.7  14.7  61.4  Drainage/Utilities/Sub-Grade  4.5  43.2  52.4  12.6  35.9  Paving  2.0  18.92  1.2  1.0  19.1  Maximum Daily Emissions  8.5  93.1  54.7  14.7  61.4  EDCAQMD Thresholds of Significance  82  82  AAQS  AAQS  AAQS  Exceed EDCAQMD Thresholds of Significance?  NO  YES  YES  YES  YES  Notes: lb/day = pounds per day; ROG = reactive organic gases; NOX = oxides of nitrogen; PM10 = respirable particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 micrometers or less; PM2.5 = respirable particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less; AAQS = Ambient Air Quality Standards Source: Modeled by Ascent Environmental, Inc. in 2016  As shown in Table 3.13-5, construction associated with the Alternative B transportation improvements could result in maximum daily NOX emissions of approximately 93 lb/day, which would exceed EDCAQMD thresholds of significance for NOX, while emissions of ROG would not exceed applicable EDCAQMD thresholds of 82 lb/day. Because maximum daily emissions of NOX would exceed applicable thresholds, exhaust emissions of CO, PM10, and PM2.5 could also potentially result in exceedances of the AAQS. With respect to fugitive dust PM10 and PM2.5 emissions, EDCAQMD determines significance based on whether or not all available fugitive dust control measures as described in EDCAQMD’s CEQA Guide (2002) are implemented. Although some dust control measures would be required by TRPA and EDCAQMD (i.e., Rule 202 and 223-1) as described above in Section 3.13.1, “Regulatory Setting,” further dust control measures are available and recommended for implementation by EDCAQMD. Thus, because all available dust control measures are not included in the project, construction activities could result in excessive fugitive dust emissions. Project construction could result in exceedances of NAAQS and CAAQS with respect to exhaust emissions of NOX, CO, PM10, and PM2.5, and could generate excessive fugitive dust emissions. This would be a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the Alternative B transportation improvements to further reduce to the extent feasible short-term construction-generated emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursors.  Mixed-use Development including Replacement Housing In addition to the Alternative B transportation improvements discussed above, three individual mixed-use development sites could be redeveloped. It is assumed that one of these sites would be constructed prior to the construction of the transportation improvements in California to accommodate residents displaced for right-of-way purposes. Construction of these sites could occur in conjunction with transportation improvements. Each site would include a mix of commercial and residential land uses as well as a combination of parking structures and parking lots. See Exhibits 2-9 and 2-10 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives,” for the location of the three mixed-use sites and conceptual site plans.  The maximum allowable development that could occur between the three sites could include up to 224 housing units, 48,000 square feet of commercial space, and 472 parking spaces. Because development of the replacement housing at the three mixed-use development sites would occur prior to the US 50 improvements in California but may occur simultaneously with the US 50 improvements occurring in Nevada, emissions modeling was conducted separately so that the various scenarios could be evaluated. For a conservative analysis, it was assumed that construction of the two largest sites (i.e., Sites 1 and 2) could overlap in time. Existing structures and vegetation would be removed for development of Site 1 and Site 2. Site 3 is currently a surface parking lot and therefore would only require minimal site preparation. Maximum daily emissions associated with construction of the mixed-use sites and combined maximum emissions are shown in Table 3.13-6.  As shown in Table 3.13-6, construction associated with the mixed-use development sites, including replacement housing, would not result in maximum daily ROG emissions that exceed applicable EDCAQMD thresholds of significance of 82 lb/day. However, construction of the mixed-use development, whether constructed alone or simultaneously with the US 50 transportation improvements, would result in maximum daily NOX emissions that exceed applicable EDCAQMD thresholds of significance of 82 lb/day. Because maximum daily emissions of NOX would exceed applicable thresholds, exhaust emissions of CO, PM10, and PM2.5 could also potentially result in exceedances of the AAQS. With respect to fugitive PM10 and PM2.5 emissions, EDCAQMD determines significance based on the consistency of the project with incorporation of all available fugitive dust control measures as described in EDCAQMD’s CEQA Guide (2002). Although some dust control measures would be required by TRPA and EDCAQMD (i.e., Rule 202 and 223-1) as described above in Section 3.13.1, “Regulatory Setting,” further dust control measures are available. Thus, because daily NOX thresholds would be exceeded and all available dust control measures are not included in the project, construction activities could result in exceedances of NAAQS and CAAQS with respect to exhaust emissions of NOX, CO, PM10, and PM2.5, and could generate excessive fugitive dust PM10 and PM2.5 emissions. This would be a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to further reduce to the extent feasible short-term construction-generated emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursors.   Table 3.13-6 Mixed-Use Development Maximum Daily Construction Emissions (lb/day) Associated with Alternatives B, C, and D  Mixed-Use Only  ROG  NOX  PM10  PM 2.5  CO  Site 1 Maximum Emissions  27.7  52.3  21.0  12.6  24.8  Site 2 Maximum Emissions  21.4  52.4  21.1  12.6  24.6  Site 3 Maximum Emissions  35.6  45.4  7.6  4.5  24.6  Maximum Emissions (Site 1 and Site 2)  49.1  104.7  42.1  25.2  48.9  EDCAQMD Thresholds of Significance  82  82  AAQS  AAQS  AAQS  Exceed EDCAQMD Thresholds of Significance?  NO  YES  YES (fugitive dust only)  YES (fugitive dust only)  NO  Mixed-Use + Transportation Improvements Overlap  ROG  NOX  PM10  PM 2.5  CO  Maximum Emissions (Mixed-Use + Transportation Improvements)  57.7  197.8  96.8  39.9  110.3  Exceed EDCAQMD Thresholds of Significance?  NO  YES  YES (fugitive dust only)  YES (fugitive dust only)  NO  Notes: lb/day = pounds per day; ROG = reactive organic gases; NOX = oxides of nitrogen; PM10 = respirable particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 micrometers or less; PM2.5 = respirable particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less; AAQS = Ambient Air Quality Standards Source: Modeled by Ascent Environmental, Inc. in 2016  Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for construction-period emission exceedances of NAAQS and CAAQS as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential for short-term construction emissions to exceed NAAQS and CAAQS would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a significant impact as it relates to short-term construction-generated emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursors. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites to further reduce to the extent feasible short-term construction-generated emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursors. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements The alignment of Alternative C would be the same as Alternative B. However, Alternative C would involve one-way travel within the tourist core and on the realigned US 50. Exhibit 2-3 provides and overview of the roadway network, intersection improvements, and travel patterns associated with Alternative C. Proposed construction activities and construction duration would be similar on a given day with Alternative C as compared to Alternative B (See Table 3.13-5 for emissions estimate). Therefore, maximum construction-related emissions and associated impacts would be the same. This would be a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the Alternative C transportation improvements to further reduce to the extent feasible short-term construction-generated emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursors. Mixed-use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative C includes the potential redevelopment of the same three mixed-use development sites within the project site as Alternative B. Exhibits 2-9 and 2-10 show the location and redevelopment potential for Alternative C. The maximum amount of development that could occur on these three sites with Alternative C would be the same as that described above for Alternative B (See Table 3.13-6 for emissions estimate). Therefore, maximum construction-related emissions and associated impacts would be the same. This impact would be a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to further reduce to the extent feasible short-term construction-generated emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursors. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for construction-period emission exceedances of NAAQS and CAAQS as described for the mixed-use development sites.

The relocated US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection would be further east than the Alternative B alignment. Exhibit 2-4 provides and overview of the realignment of US 50, intersection improvements, and travel patterns associated with Alternative D. Proposed construction activities and construction duration would be similar under this alternative as compared to Alternative B (see Table 3.13-5 for emissions estimate). Therefore, maximum construction-related emissions and associated impacts would be the same. This would be a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the Alternative D transportation improvements to further reduce to the extent feasible short-term construction-generated emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursors. Mixed-use Development including Replacement Housing Similar to Alternative B, Alternative D includes the potential redevelopment of the three mixed-use development sites. Because the highway realignment differs from Alternative B in the area southwest of the Heavenly Village Center, the configuration of Sites 1 and 2 are different for Alternative D. Exhibits 2-11 and 2-12 show the location and a potential mix of uses that could be developed at these sites through a public private partnership. The maximum amount of development that could occur on these three sites under Alternative D would be essentially the same as that described above for Alternative B (see Table 13.1-6 for emissions estimate). Therefore, maximum construction-related emissions and associated impacts would be the same. This impact would be a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to further reduce to the extent feasible short-term construction-generated emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursors. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for construction-period emission exceedances of NAAQS and CAAQS as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential for short-term construction emissions to exceed NAAQS and CAAQS would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a significant impact as it relates to short-term construction-generated emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursors. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites to further reduce to the extent feasible short-term construction-generated emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursors. Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E would feature a concrete deck over the entire width and length of existing US 50 within the tourist core between a location about 100 feet south of Stateline Avenue and a location near the northern end of the Montbleu Resort (about 450 feet south of Lake Parkway). The deck would serve as a pedestrian “skywalk” facility or pedestrian walkway above US 50 near the existing resort-casinos. The width would be approximately 75 feet. The skywalk would be constructed on 4-foot wide columns spaced approximately 20 feet on center running along both sides of the highway for the entire length of the bridge. Construction-related emissions associated with this alternative are shown below in Table 3.13-7. Table 3.13-7 Maximum Daily Construction Emissions (lb/day) Associated with the Transportation improvements for Alternative E    ROG  NOX  PM10  PM2.5  CO  Demolition  1.5  17.7  4.9  1.4  10.6  Grubbing/Land Clearing  1.2  14.1  50.6  10.9  7.2  Grading/Excavation  3.6  38.6  52.0  12.2  26.1  Drainage/Utilities/Sub-Grade  6.3  64.3  53.4  13.6  45.3  Paving  2.4  23.2  1.5  1.4  18.1  Maximum Daily Emissions  6.3  64.3  53.4  13.6  45.7  EDCAQMD Thresholds of Significance  82  82  AAQS  AAQS  AAQS  Exceed EDCAQMD Thresholds of Significance?  NO  NO  YES (fugitive dust only)  YES (fugitive dust only)  NO  Notes: lb/day = pounds per day; ROG = reactive organic gases; NOX = oxides of nitrogen; PM10 = respirable particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 micrometers or less; PM2.5 = respirable particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less; AAQS = Ambient Air Quality Standards Source: Modeled by Ascent Environmental, Inc. in 2016  As shown in Table 3.13-7, construction associated with Alternative E would not result in maximum daily NOX or ROG emissions that exceed applicable EDCAQMD thresholds of significance of 82 lb/day. With regards to construction-related exhaust emissions of CO, PM10, and PM2.5 because ROG and NOX emissions would not exceed applicable thresholds, all other exhaust emissions would also be considered less than significant (EDCAQMD 2002). With respect to fugitive dust PM10 and PM2.5 emissions, EDCAQMD determines significance based on the consistency of the project with incorporation of all available fugitive dust control measures as described in EDCAQMD’s CEQA Guide (2002). Although some dust control measures would be required by TRPA and EDCAQMD (i.e., Rule 202 and 223-1) as described above in Section 3.13.1, “Regulatory Setting,” further dust control measures are available. Thus, because all available dust control measures are not included in the project, construction activities could result in excessive fugitive dust emissions. This would be a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into Alternative E to further reduce to the extent feasible short-term construction-generated emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursors. Impact 3.13-2: Consistency with air quality plans and regional transportation conformity The US Department of Transportation (DOT) made a CAA conformity determination for the TMPO’s 2012 RTP/SCS (i.e., Mobility 2035) on January 28, 2013 (FHWA 2013). The 2015 Federal Transportation Improvement Program is consistent with the transportation system and financial plan described in the most recent amendment to the Mobility 2035 and was adopted by TRPA and TMPO on December 12, 2012 (TRPA and TMPO 2012). The 2015 FTIP met all air quality conformity requirements when approved. The design concept and scope of Alternatives B, C, and D are consistent with the project description in the applicable RTP/SCS and FTIP. Although Alternative E would not be consistent with the design concept and scope described in the RTP/SCS, this alternative would not increase regional VMT. Therefore, implementation of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would be consistent with the assumptions in the regional emissions analysis in the RTP and would conform to the SIP and meet Federal Conformity Requirements. There would be no regional increase in mobile-source emissions and the region would continue to conform to applicable air quality plans.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid an adverse effect on air quality and are consistent with air quality plans and regional transportation conformity such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; No Impact for Alternative A As discussed above in Section 3.13.1, “Regulatory Setting,” the CAA of 1970, as amended, requires a demonstration that federal actions conform to the SIP and similar approved plans in areas that are designated as nonattainment or have maintenance plans for criteria pollutants. Transportation measures, such as the locally preferred action, are analyzed for conformity with the SIP as part of the applicable RTP and FTIP. If the design concept and scope of a proposed transportation project is consistent with the project description in the applicable RTP and FTIP, as well as the assumptions in the regional emissions analysis for the RTP and FTIP, then the locally preferred action would conform to the SIP, would meet Federal Conformity requirements, and would not result in an adverse impact on regional air quality. Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Under Alternative A there would be no improvements to existing US 50, Lake Parkway, or other roadways within the project site or new land use development. Alternative A would not result in any operational-related regional emissions. Existing traffic conditions, including existing levels of congestion and traffic flow would continue, and therefore, could potentially prevent full, effective implementation of the 2035 RTP, which aims to improve connectivity, reliability, travel times, and operations of public transportation, as well as increased mobility and safety of bicycles and pedestrians. However, with Alternative A there would be no change in existing conditions and, thus, no impact would occur for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements TMPO and DOT must make a determination that the applicable RTP and FTIP conform to the applicable SIP. Conformity to the SIP means that transportation activities would not create new air quality violations, worsen existing violations, or delay the attainment of the NAAQS. Federal regulations also require TMPO to conduct an air quality conformity analysis of all regionally-significant projects that increase the capacity of the transportation system. All regionally-significant capacity-increasing transportation projects, regardless of funding sources, must be included in the FTIP.  TMPO adopted its RTP, Mobility 2035: Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan (2035 RTP), on December 12, 2012 (TRPA and TMPO 2012). Upon adoption of the RTP, FHWA and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) approved the air quality conformity finding. The locally preferred action, US 50 South Shore Community Revitalization Project, is included in the 2035 RTP in the “Planned Corridor Revitalization Projects” (TRPA and TMPO 2012). In addition, the 2013 FTIP, a four-year program of surface transportation projects, was adopted on September 26, 2012 and amended on January 23, 2013 (TMPO 2013). The locally preferred action is included in the 2015 FTIP and shown on the Project Location Map (TMPO 2014). The locally preferred action is also included in the list of projects in the 2017 RTP, which is an update to the 2012 RTP and has been circulated for public review. The design concept and scope of Alternative B are consistent with the project description in the federally approved 2012 RTP and 2015 FTIP, and the assumptions included in TRPA’s regional emissions analysis. Therefore, Alternative B would not result in long-term operational-related increases in criteria air pollutants or precursors, would conform to the SIP and meet Federal Conformity Requirements, and no adverse regional air quality impact would occur as a result of implementation of Alternative B. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the Alternative B transportation improvements would avoid an adverse effect on air quality and are consistent with air quality plans and regional transportation conformity such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-use Development including Replacement Housing The Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, could generate slightly more trips in the study area than the land uses they would replace (a net increase of approximately 1,400 to 1,700 additional daily trips). However, the concentration of transit-oriented types of mixed-use development that could occur with Alternative B are an example of the type of project contemplated in the TRPA Regional Plan and RTP, as well as the TCAP, for this area. Because growth in the Tahoe Basin is controlled by the TRPA commodity system and the Regional Plan EIS, RTP EIR/EIS, and TCAP anticipated growth of this scale in this area, the development potential associated with the three mixed-use sites would not cause regional VMT in the Tahoe Basin to increase beyond that which has already been contemplated (TMPO and TRPA 2012). Therefore, because similar land uses and development densities were accounted for in TRPA’s regional emissions analysis, the development of these mixed-use sites would not interfere with the Region’s ability to meet VMT reduction targets set forth in the RTP.  Nonetheless, emission modeling was conducted to estimate potential impacts associated with the trips generated by the mixed-use sites. As shown in Appendix J, operational-related mobile emissions associated with all of the mixed-use sites combined and assuming no VMT benefits from existing surrounding land uses would not exceed 29 lb/day of NOX or 10 lb/day of ROG, which is substantially below EDCAQMD’s adopted operational thresholds for NOX and ROG of 82 lb/day. (Note: Diesel exhaust emissions are discussed separately under Impact 3.13-4.) This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the Alternative B mixed-use development sites would avoid an adverse effect on air quality and are consistent with air quality plans and regional transportation conformity such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for an adverse effect on air quality to occur as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of potential air quality impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on air quality and are consistent with air quality plans and regional transportation conformity. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid an adverse effect on air quality and are consistent with air quality plans and regional transportation conformity such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Impacts of Alternative C transportation improvements would be the same as described for Alternative B transportation improvements because the design concept and scope of Alternative C would also be consistent with the description of the US 50 South Shore Community Revitalization Project in the 2035 RTP and the 2013 FTIP, and the assumptions in TMPO’s Regional emissions analysis. Therefore, Alternative C would not result in long-term operational-related increases in criteria air pollutants or precursors, would conform to the SIP and meet Federal Conformity Requirements, and no adverse regional air quality impact would occur as a result of implementation of Alternative C. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the Alternative C transportation improvements would avoid an adverse effect on air quality and are consistent with air quality plans and regional transportation conformity such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-use Development including Replacement Housing The Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in the same trip generation increases as described above for Alternative B, because the redevelopment sites are the same. Thus, for the same reasons described for Alternative B, the addition of mixed-use development for this alternative would not result in substantial long-term operational criteria air pollutants or precursors, or interfere with the regions ability to meet VMT reduction targets set in the RTP. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the Alternative C mixed-use development sites would avoid an adverse effect on air quality and are consistent with air quality plans and regional transportation conformity such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for an adverse effect on air quality to occur as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of potential air quality impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on air quality and are consistent with air quality plans and regional transportation conformity. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would avoid an adverse effect on air quality and are consistent with air quality plans and regional transportation conformity such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements Impacts of Alternative D would be the same as described for Alternative B because the design concept and scope of Alternative D would also be consistent with the description of the US 50 South Shore Community Revitalization Project in the 2035 RTP and the 2013 FTIP, and the assumptions in TMPO’s Regional emissions analysis. Therefore, Alternative D would not result in long-term operational-related increases in criteria air pollutants or precursors, would conform to the SIP and meet Federal Conformity Requirements, and no adverse regional air quality impact would occur as a result of implementation of Alternative D. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the Alternative D transportation improvements would avoid an adverse effect on air quality and are consistent with air quality plans and regional transportation conformity such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-use Development including Replacement Housing The Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, under this alternative would result in similar trip generation increases as described above for Alternative B. Thus, for the same reasons described for Alternative B, the addition of the mixed-use developments under this alternative would not result in substantial long-term operational criteria air pollutants or precursors, or interfere with the Region’s ability to meet VMT reduction targets set in the RTP. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the Alternative D mixed-use development would avoid an adverse effect on air quality and are consistent with air quality plans and regional transportation conformity such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for an adverse effect on air quality to occur as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of potential air quality impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on air quality and are consistent with air quality plans and regional transportation conformity. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development as part of Alternative D would avoid an adverse effect on air quality and are consistent with air quality plans and regional transportation conformity such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alternative E: Skywalk The design concept and scope of this alternative are not consistent with the project description in the approved RTP and FTIP. However, regional VMT would not increase over existing VMT as a result of this alternative. Therefore, Alternative E would be consistent with assumptions included in TRPA’s regional emissions analysis and conform to the SIP and meet Federal Conformity Requirements. No adverse regional air quality impact would occur as a result of implementation of Alternative E. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, because Alternative E would avoid an adverse effect on air quality, as there would be no change in VMT, no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Impact 3.13-3: Project-level transportation conformity with respect to localized, long-term mobile-source carbon monoxide emissions Though implementation of all of the build alternatives (Alternatives B through E) and the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, associated with Alternatives B, C, and D would result in changes to the roadway network and traffic patterns in the study area, implementation of any of the alternatives would not result in increases in traffic such that quantitative screening criteria for local CO emissions would be triggered during project operations. Implementation of any of the alternatives, including Alternative A and mixed-use development sites, where applicable, would not result in increased concentrations of CO that would expose sensitive receptors to unhealthy levels.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives A, B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize localized, long-term mobile-source carbon monoxide such that project-level conformity is met and no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives A, B, C, D, and E In addition to a regional conformity determination, as discussed above under Impact 3.13-2, a microscale or “hot-spot” analysis is required for projects within a federal nonattainment or maintenance area. With regards to the NAAQS for CO, the El Dorado County portion of the LTAB is designated as a maintenance area and therefore, consistent with NEPA requirements, a further demonstration of conformity--at the project level—is required. This analysis includes a screening procedure consistent with EDCAQMD guidance.  In addition, a quantitative hot-spot analysis, consistent with information published by FHWA related to project-level Conformity Analysis, the Standard Environmental Reference (SER) Air Quality Conformity Findings Checklist, applicable U.S. EPA project-level analysis guidance, the Transportation Conformity Regulations at 40 CFR 93 Subpart A, and Section 176(c) of the CAA (42 USC 7506(c)) has been conducted and is included in Appendix J of this document. The following discussion is focused on compliance with EDCAQMD CEQA guidance. A CO hotspot is an area of localized CO pollution that is caused by severe vehicle congestion on major roadways, typically near intersections. CO hotspots are a direct function of traffic volume, speed, and delay. Transport of CO is extremely limited because it disperses rapidly with distance from the source under normal meteorological conditions. However, under certain specific meteorological conditions, CO concentrations near roadways and/or intersections may reach unhealthy levels at nearby sensitive land uses, such as housing units, schools, and childcare facilities. Thus, high CO concentrations are considered to have a direct influence on the receptors they affect.  Caltrans has developed a Transportation Project-Level Carbon Monoxide Protocol (Protocol) for assessing CO impacts for federal conformity determinations, NEPA, and CEQA. The Protocol is the standard method for project-level CO analysis used by Caltrans. Using this methodology, if a project is determined to not have a significant CO impact under these guidelines it would also not be considered to have a significant impact under State of Nevada standards. According to the protocol, projects may worsen air quality if they increase the percentage of vehicles in cold start modes by 2 percent or more; significantly increase traffic volumes (by 5 percent or more) over existing volumes; or worsen traffic flow, defined for signalized intersections as increasing average delay at intersections operating at Level of Service (LOS) E or F, or causing an intersection that would operate at LOS D or better without the project, to operate at LOS E or F.  EDCAQMD considers development projects of the type and size that fall below the significance thresholds for ROG and NOX to also be insignificant for CO emissions. CO emissions associated with land use projects would mostly be associated with impacts from large concentrations of vehicles. EDCAQMD’s CEQA guidance recommends that the project be modeled according to CO concentration isopleth maps available in the guidance. However, given that the guidance was published in 2002 and had forecasted CO concentrations only out to 2010, more recent screening criteria from SMAQMD and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) are considered in this CO impact discussion (EDCAQMD 2002).  Screening criteria for SMAQMD and BAAQMD were developed based on a conservative analysis of local intersections. If the project exceeds criteria, a detailed dispersion modeling analysis would need to be performed based on local data. These screening criteria have been developed in a manner such that, if they are met, operation-related local emissions of CO (associated with mobile sources generated by development) would not violate a standard or contribute substantially to an existing or projected air quality violation or expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations. According to BAAQMD, a project would result in a less-than-significant CO impact if the project traffic would not increase volumes at affected intersections to more than 44,000 vehicles per hour (BAAQMD 2010). According to SMAQMD, a project would result in a less-than-significant CO impact if the project would not result in an affected intersection experiencing more than 31,600 vehicles per hour (SMAQMD 2009). For the purpose of this analysis, a significant impact related to CO emissions during operation would occur if the project would increase traffic volumes at nearby intersections to more than 31,600 vehicles per hour. Traffic volumes and traffic-related effects of the build alternatives discussed in this impact are based on information provided in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation,” as well as the traffic study conducted for this EIR/EIS/EIS (Wood Rogers 2016).  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) With Alternative A, there would be no improvements to existing US 50, Lake Parkway, or other roadways within the project site. However, regional traffic would continue to grow and during summer peak hours, the US 50/Stateline Avenue intersection would degrade to LOS E. No new trips would be generated by this alternative and no changes to the roadway system would occur. Further, no study intersection would experience peak traffic volumes that exceed 31,600 vehicles per hour, the screening criterion used to determine whether a CO impact could occur. Therefore, implementation of this alternative would not result in operational-related CO emissions that could exceed applicable standards or expose receptors to high CO concentrations. Further, the modeling results shown in Appendix J indicate that project-related CO emissions would not cause or contribute to any new or worsened localized violations of the federal 1-hour or 8-hour CO ambient standards. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative A would avoid creating a CO hotspot such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements As described in more detail in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation,” implementation of Alternative B transportation improvements would result in changes to traffic patterns and delay times at affected intersections. However, implementation of Alternative B transportation improvements would not result in any intersections operating at LOS E or F. Further, no study intersection would experience peak traffic volumes that exceed 31,600 vehicles per hour. Therefore, implementation of Alternative B would not result in operational-related CO emissions that could exceed applicable standards or expose receptors to high CO concentrations. Further, the modeling results shown in Appendix J indicate that project-related CO emissions would not cause or contribute to any new or worsened localized violations of the federal 1-hour or 8-hour CO ambient standards. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the Alternative B transportation improvements would avoid creating a CO hotspot such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-use Development including Replacement Housing As discussed in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation,” Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at Sites 1, 2, and 3 would generate slightly more trips than the land uses they would replace. Further, operation of the mixed-use developments would result in changes to traffic patterns and delay times at affected intersections relative to the transportation improvements alone. However, with the addition of the mixed-use development for Alternative B, the LOS at study area intersections would not degrade to LOS E or F. Further, maximum peak-hour traffic volumes associated with all three sites combined would be 143 vehicles/hour. Adding this to intersection peak volumes described above for Alternative B transportation improvements, and dispersed over the study intersections, would not result in peak-hour traffic volumes that come close to or exceed the 31,600 vehicle/hour threshold. The mixed-use development associated with Alternative B would not result in operational-related CO emissions that could exceed applicable standards or expose receptors to high CO concentrations. Further, the modeling results shown in Appendix J indicate that project-related CO emissions would not cause or contribute to any new or worsened localized violations of the federal 1-hour or 8-hour CO ambient standards. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would avoid creating a CO hotspot such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for a CO hotspot effect to occur as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of potential CO hotspots would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact as it relates to the potential to create CO hotspots.  For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid creating a CO hotspot such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements As described in more detail in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation,” implementation of Alternative C transportation improvements would result in changes to traffic patterns and delay times at affected intersections. Based on the traffic study conducted for the project, implementation of Alternative C would cause operations at the signal at Realigned US 50/Pioneer Trail/Existing US 50 and the roundabout at Realigned US 50/Lake Parkway/Existing US 50 to be degraded from LOS B to LOS F, and operations at the signal at Realigned US 50/Lake Parkway/Existing US 50 to be degraded from LOS B to LOS E. However, with implementation of this alternative no study intersection would experience peak traffic volumes that exceed 31,600 vehicles per hour. Therefore, although LOS would be degraded at some intersections associated with Alternative C, existing plus project-related peak traffic volumes would not reach levels associated with high CO concentrations. Thus, in accordance with applicable screening criteria, implementation of Alternative C transportation improvements would not result in operational-related CO emissions that could exceed applicable standards or expose receptors to high CO concentrations. Further, the modeling results shown in Appendix J indicate that project-related CO emissions would not cause or contribute to any new or worsened localized violations of the federal 1-hour or 8-hour CO ambient standards. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the Alternative C transportation improvements would avoid creating a CO hotspot such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative C includes redevelopment of the same three mixed-use development sites and replacement housing within the project site as with Alternative B. However, as described above for Alternative C transportation improvements, implementation of this alternative would cause three intersections to operate at LOS E or F.  With the addition of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, and related traffic to Alternative C, the intersection of existing US 50/Stateline Ave would also operate at LOS F. However, maximum peak-hour traffic volumes associated with all three sites combined could reach 154 vehicles per hour. Adding this to intersection peak volumes described above for the transportation improvements, and dispersed over the study intersections, would not result in peak-hour traffic volumes that come close to or exceed the 31,600 vehicles per hour threshold. The addition of the mixed-use development to Alternative C would not result in operational-related CO emissions that could exceed applicable standards or expose receptors to high CO concentrations. Further, the modeling results shown in Appendix J indicate that project-related CO emissions would not cause or contribute to any new or worsened localized violations of the federal 1-hour or 8-hour CO ambient standards. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would avoid creating a CO hotspot such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for a CO hotspot effect to occur as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of potential CO hotspots would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact as it relates to the potential to create CO hotspots.  For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would avoid creating a CO hotspot such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements As described in more detail in in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation,” implementation of Alternative D transportation improvements would result in changes to traffic patterns and delay times at affected intersections. However, implementation of Alternative D would not result in any intersection operating at LOS E or F. Further, no study intersection would experience peak traffic volumes that exceed 31,600 vehicles per hour. Therefore, implementation of Alternative D would not result in operational-related CO emissions that could exceed applicable standards or expose receptors to high CO concentrations. Further, the modeling results shown in Appendix J indicate that project-related CO emissions would not cause or contribute to any new or worsened localized violations of the federal 1-hour or 8-hour CO ambient standards. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the Alternative D transportation improvements would avoid creating a CO hotspot such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative D includes redevelopment of the same three sites within the project site as Alternative B. Because the highway realignment differs from Alternative B, the configuration of Sites 1 and 2 are different for Alternative D. However, the maximum amount of development that could occur on these three sites under Alternative D would be similar to that evaluated and described above for Alternative B. Similar to Alternative B, LOS would not be altered as a result of adding the mixed-use developments. Peak-hour traffic volumes associated with Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, with this alternative would be slightly lower as compared to Alternative B (i.e., 126 vehicles per hour). Therefore, impacts associated with operational-related CO emissions would be the same as Alternative B. Further, the modeling results shown in Appendix J indicate that project-related CO emissions would not cause or contribute to any new or worsened localized violations of the federal 1-hour or 8-hour CO ambient standards. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the Alternative D mixed-use development site, including replacement housing, would avoid creating a CO hotspot such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for a CO hotspot effect to occur as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of potential CO hotspots would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact as it relates to the potential to create CO hotspots.  For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would avoid creating a CO hotspot such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative E: Skywalk As described in more detail in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation,” implementation of Alternative E would result in changes to traffic patterns in the resort-casino area with the removal of the signal and at-grade pedestrian scramble between Hard Rock and Montbleu and delay times at affected intersections. However, implementation of Alternative E would not result in any intersections operating at LOS E or F. Further, no study intersection would experience peak traffic volumes that exceed 31,600 vehicles per hour. Therefore, implementation of Alternative E would not result in operational-related CO emissions that could exceed applicable standards or expose receptors to high CO concentrations. Further, the modeling results shown in Appendix J indicate that project-related CO emissions would not cause or contribute to any new or worsened localized violations of the federal 1-hour or 8-hour CO ambient standards. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid creating a CO hotspot such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Impact 3.13-4: Exposure of sensitive receptors to Mobile Source Air Toxics/Toxic Air Contaminants Construction-related activities would result in short-term project-generated emissions of diesel PM under all build alternatives. However, construction would be relatively short in duration (i.e., up to 3 years), would not occur in the same location for extended periods of time, and with incorporated mitigation exhaust emissions would not be significant. As such, construction activities associated with Alternatives B, C, D, and E transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not expose sensitive receptors to excessive levels of MSAT/TACs.  In accordance with FHWA guidance, projects that do not result in more than 140,000 AADT have a low potential to result in impacts from MSAT. Further, guidance provided by ARB indicates that elevated health risks from operational exposure to diesel exhaust is associated primarily with high volume roadways of 100,000 ADT or more. Implementation of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would result in less than 40,000 ADT during the summer peak season for all affected roadway segments. Therefore, implementation of Alternatives B, C, D, and E is not anticipated to result in a significant health risk impact to sensitive receptors in the study area. Implementation of Alternative A would not result in any new sensitive receptors placed in close proximity to existing sources of MSAT/TAC emissions and no sources of MSAT/TAC emissions would be placed in close proximity to sensitive land uses. NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives A, B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the exposure of sensitive receptors to air toxics such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives A, B, C, D, and E In addition to the criteria air pollutants for which there are NAAQS and CAAQS, the EPA and ARB also regulate air toxics. As described in Section 3.13.1, “Regulatory Setting,” above, the seven compounds acrolein, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, diesel PM, formaldehyde, naphthalene, and polycyclic organic matter are collectively referred to as MSAT. Diesel PM, one of the seven MSAT mentioned above, was identified as a TAC by ARB in 1998. The potential cancer risk from the inhalation of diesel PM outweighs the potential for all other health impacts (i.e., non-cancer chronic risk, short-term acute risk) and health impacts from other TACs and MSAT. As a result, diesel PM is the primary TAC of concern with regards to health effects on sensitive receptors. However, because diesel PM is included within the compounds determined by EPA as an MSAT, for purposes of this analysis, MSAT are synonymous with TACs.  When it comes to evaluating MSAT emissions at the project level, health effects on nearby sensitive receptors is the primary concern. In FHWA’s view, information is incomplete or unavailable to credibly predict the project-specific health impacts due to changes in MSAT emissions associated with a proposed set of highway alternatives. The outcome of such an assessment, adverse or not, would be influenced more by the uncertainty introduced into the process through assumption and speculation rather than any genuine insight into the actual health impacts directly attributable to MSAT exposure associated with a proposed action. The EPA is responsible for protecting the public health and welfare from any known or anticipated effect of an air pollutant. They are the lead authority for administering the CAA and its amendments and have specific statutory obligations with respect to hazardous air pollutants and MSAT. The EPA is in the continual process of assessing human health effects, exposures, and risks posed by air pollutants. Other organizations are also active in the research and analyses of the human health effects of MSAT, including the Health Effects Institute. Two Health Effects Institute studies are summarized in Appendix D of FHWA’s Interim Guidance Update on Mobile Source Air Toxic Analysis in NEPA Documents (FHWA 2016). Among the adverse health effects linked to MSAT compounds at high exposures are cancer in humans in occupational settings; cancer in animals; and irritation to the respiratory tract, including the exacerbation of asthma. Less obvious is the adverse human health effects of MSAT compounds at current environmental concentrations or in the future as vehicle emissions substantially decrease. The methodologies for forecasting health impacts include emissions modeling, dispersion modeling, exposure modeling, and then final determination of health impacts; each step in the process builds on the model predictions obtained in the previous step. All are encumbered by technical shortcomings or uncertain science that prevents a more complete differentiation of the MSAT health impacts among a set of project alternatives. These difficulties are magnified for lifetime (i.e., 70-year) assessments, particularly because unsupportable assumptions would have to be made regarding changes in travel patterns and vehicle technology (which affects emissions rates) over that time frame, since such information is unavailable.  It is particularly difficult to reliably forecast 70-year lifetime MSAT concentrations and exposure near roadways; to determine the portion of time that people are actually exposed at a specific location; and to establish the extent attributable to a proposed action, especially given that some of the information needed is unavailable. There are considerable uncertainties associated with the existing estimates of toxicity of the various MSAT, because of factors such as low-dose extrapolation and translation of occupational exposure data to the general population, a concern expressed by the Health Effects Institute. As a result, there is no national consensus on air dose-response values assumed to protect the public health and welfare for MSAT compounds, and in particular for diesel PM. The EPA and the Health Effects Institute have not established a basis for quantitative risk assessment of diesel PM in ambient settings. There is also the lack of a national consensus on an acceptable level of risk. The current context is the process used by the EPA as provided by the CAA to determine whether more stringent controls are required to provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health or to prevent an adverse environmental effect for industrial sources subject to the maximum achievable control technology standards, such as benzene emissions from refineries. The decision framework is a two-step process. The first step requires the EPA to determine a “safe” or “acceptable” level of risk due to emissions from a source, which is generally no greater than approximately 100 in a million. Additional factors are considered in the second step, the goal of which is to maximize the number of people with risks less than 1 in a million due to emissions from a source. The results of this statutory two-step process do not guarantee that cancer risks from exposure to air toxics are less than 1 in a million; in some cases, the residual risk determination could result in maximum individual cancer risks that are as high as approximately 100 in a million. In a June 2008 decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the EPA’s approach to addressing risk in its two-step decision framework. Information is incomplete or unavailable to establish that even the largest of highway projects would result in levels of risk greater than safe or acceptable. Because of the limitations in the methodologies for forecasting health impacts described, any predicted difference in health impacts between alternatives is likely to be much smaller than the uncertainties associated with predicting the impacts. Consequently, the results of such assessments would not be useful to decision-makers, who would need to weigh this information against project benefits such as reducing traffic congestion, accident rates, and fatalities plus improved access for emergency response, which are better suited for quantitative analysis. Considering the limitations and uncertainties involved in MSAT analysis. FHWA has published guidance for conducting MSAT analyses, which provides a tiered approach, depending on the specific project circumstances. Based on 2016 FHWA guidance, no analysis for projects with no potential for meaningful MSAT effects; Qualitative analysis for projects with low potential MSAT effects; or Quantitative analysis to differentiate alternatives for projects with higher potential MSAT effects should be conducted. In 2005 ARB published the Air Quality and Land Use Guidebook, which provides recommendations for siting sensitive land uses near roadways. Operational-related MSAT/TAC emissions were evaluated in accordance with FHWA and ARB guidance. The basis of this analysis relies on the FHWA guidance and incorporates California-specific requirements/considerations where applicable. The project would include on- and off-road mobile sources associated with construction vehicle fleet as well as on-road vehicle travel on existing and new roadway alignments associated with the build alternatives. Based on the project-specific traffic study, implementation of any of the build alternatives transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not result in traffic volumes of 140,000 AADT or greater and therefore a qualitative analysis is warranted (Wood Rogers 2016). Emissions from construction and operations are evaluated separately.  Traffic volumes and traffic-related effects as a result of action alternatives discussed in this impact is based on information provided in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation,” as well as the traffic study conducted for this EIR/EIS/EIS (Wood Rogers 2016).  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Under Alternative A there would be no improvements to existing US 50, Lake Parkway, or other roadways within the project site. There would be no demolition or construction, and no new land use development. Alternative A would not result in any construction-related emissions of MSAT/TACs. No new sensitive receptors would be placed in close proximity to existing sources of MSAT/TACs and no sources of MSAT/TACs emissions would be placed in close proximity to sensitive land uses. Further, as described in the Regulatory Setting and in further detail below, MSAT emissions are expected to continue to decrease into the future. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. With Alternative A (No Project), the roadway system within the project site boundaries would continue to be inadequate to meet the existing or projected traffic volumes. The continued periods of traffic congestion during the peak summer and winter seasons would degrade and discourage bicycle and pedestrian travel in the tourist core and along major roadways, and inhibit the operation of and accessibility to transit services. Cut-through traffic on local roadways would continue as it does today.  Further, Alternative A assumes that the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project, which is included in RTP EIR/EIS Alternative 3, would not be constructed. Therefore, the community revitalization opportunity of the highway realignment would not be realized, including the reduction of VMT made possible by revitalization of a more walkable, bikable, and transit-served urban center. Alternative A would not substantially change VMT nor contribute toward the Region reaching its goal of reducing VMT below 1981 levels. Nonetheless, according to recent FHWA MSAT trends analysis using updated emissions modeling that incorporates all MSAT-reducing rules and regulations, FHWA estimates that even if VMT increases (nationwide) by 45 percent from 2010 to 2050 as forecast, a combined reduction of 91 percent in the total annual emissions for the priority MSAT is projected for the same time period. Exhibit 3.13-1 below shows the results of MSAT emissions analysis conducted by FHWA. As shown above, a substantial decrease in MSAT emissions can be expected between the existing and future No Project conditions. Thus, even considering that no regional benefits to VMT would occur with Alternative A, MSAT emissions would be expected to continue to decrease in the future. For the purposes of NEPA, Alternative A would not expose sensitive receptors to air toxics, such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.    Notes: MSAT = Mobile Source Air Toxics; Mt = Megatonnes; yr = year; VMT = Vehicle Miles Traveled. Source: FHWA 2016 Exhibit 3.13-1  Projected National Mobile Source Air Toxics Emission Trends 2010 through 2050 for Vehicles Operating on Roadways     Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements For construction activities, diesel PM is the primary TAC of concern. Construction-related activities for Alternative B transportation improvements would result in short-term project-generated emissions of diesel PM from the exhaust of off-road heavy-duty diesel equipment used in site preparation (e.g., clearing and grading); onsite hauling of soil for cut and fill activities; paving; on-road truck travel; and other miscellaneous activities. On-road diesel-powered haul trucks and worker commute vehicles (MSAT other than diesel PM are associated with gasoline engines) traveling to and from the construction area to deliver materials and equipment are less of a concern because they would not stay on the site for long durations.  The primary factor used to determine health risk (i.e., potential exposure to TAC emission levels that exceed applicable standards) is the dose to which receptors are exposed. Existing sensitive receptors are located throughout the study area and could be located in relative close proximity to construction activities (i.e., within 100 feet).  Dose is a function of the concentration of one or more substances in the environment and the duration of exposure to that substance. Dose is positively correlated with time, meaning that a longer exposure period would result in a higher exposure level for any exposed receptor. Thus, the risks estimated for an exposed individual are higher if a fixed exposure occurs over a longer period of time. According to the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) Health Risk Assessments, which determine the exposure of sensitive receptors to TAC emissions, should be based on a 70- or 30-year exposure period (OEHHA 2012). Construction activities associated with the transportation improvements under this alternative are conservatively assumed to last up to three years. However, due to the linear nature of the project and the relatively short duration of overall activities, no one receptor would be exposed to construction-related emissions for excessive periods of time. Thus, given that construction activities would move throughout the site limiting exposure to any one area, and the relatively short overall construction period of three years, emissions of MSAT/TAC during construction would not expose nearby sensitive receptors to excessive levels (i.e., an incremental increase in cancer risk that exceeds of 10 in one million or a Hazard Index greater than 1.0 at the maximally exposed individual).  With regards to operations and as described in more detail in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation,” implementation of Alternative B would result in slight increases in AADT and VMT on affected roadway segments. Further, as a result of the new alignment, existing sensitive land uses currently not in close proximity to US 50 (e.g., residences along Primrose Road and Moss Road) would now be located as close as 100 feet to the realigned US 50 alignment.  In accordance with FHWA guidance, projects that do not result in more than 140,000 AADT have a low potential to result in impacts from MSAT. Further, given the regulatory environment associated with MSAT, as described in Section 3.13.1, “Regulatory Setting,” and shown above in Exhibit 3.13-1, MSAT emissions have been trending down and will continue to decrease into the future. In addition, guidance provided by ARB indicates that elevated health risks from operational exposure to diesel exhaust is associated primarily with high volume roadways (100,000 ADT) and facilities with substantial diesel exhaust such as truck stops, distribution centers and transit centers. Based on the traffic study conducted, implementation of this alternative would result in less than 40,000 ADT during the summer peak season for all affected roadway segments, with less than 3 percent truck trips. Therefore, Alternative B transportation improvements are not anticipated to result in a significant health risk impact to sensitive receptors in the study area. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. The amount of MSAT emitted would be proportional to the VMT, assuming that other variables such as fleet mix remains the same as compared to Alternative A (No Project). While the highway realignment in Alternative B would result in a small increase in VMT when through trips are analyzed on their own, it is consistent with the community revitalization objectives of the approved RTP Alternative 3, which results in a beneficial reduction in regional VMT. Thus, because Alternative B would contribute to an overall regional reduction in VMT, higher levels of MSAT are not expected from Alternative B compared to Alternative A (No Project). Also, emissions would likely be lower than present levels in the design year as a result of the EPA’s national control programs that are projected to reduce annual MSAT emissions by over 90 percent from 2010 to 2050 (FHWA 2016). Local conditions may differ from these national projections in terms of fleet mix and turnover, VMT growth rates, and local control measures. However, the magnitude of the EPA-projected reductions is so great (even after accounting for VMT growth) that MSAT emissions in the study area are likely to be lower in the future in virtually all locations. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the Alternative B transportation improvements would not expose sensitive receptors to air toxics such that additional mitigation measures are not needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-use Development including Replacement Housing Construction of the mixed-use sites would generally be less intense than the construction associated with the transportation improvements. Based on modeling conducted for the mixed-use sites, assuming maximum buildout for each site and overlapping construction between Sites 1 and 2, ROG and NOX emissions would not exceed EDCAQMD’s daily thresholds. Construction of the mixed-use development sites would not be expected to overlap with construction of the transportation improvements and would generate lower amounts of exhaust emissions than construction of the transportation improvements on a daily basis. Thus, the corresponding MSAT/TAC emissions generated during construction would also be less.  The mixed-use development under Alternative B would generate more trips than the land uses being replaced (approximately 1,400–1,700 additional daily trips), which could lead to an increase in regional VMT. However, buildout of the Region in this manner was considered in the RTP EIR/EIS when VMT impacts were analyzed. All of the mixed-use development sites would occur within the City of South Lake Tahoe near the Tourist Core, which is one of the areas designated by the RTP as a Town Center/Regional Center. This is the type of development that was considered and accounted for under the RTP EIR/EIS and the TCAP, which would contribute to the overall benefit to regional VMT. That is, locating development within the Tourist Core with a variety of land uses in close proximity, would contribute to reducing VMT. Based on the traffic study conducted, ADT increases from the mixed-use development sites combined with ADT increases from this alternative without the mixed-use development would be less than 40,000 ADT during the summer peak season for all affected roadway segments, with less than 3 percent truck trips. Therefore, the project is not anticipated to result in a significant health risk impact to sensitive receptors in the study area. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. The amount of MSAT emitted would be proportional to the VMT, assuming that other variables, such as fleet mix, remain the same as Alternative A (No Project). Alternative B, even with the mixed-use development, would result in an overall reduction in VMT. Therefore, higher levels of MSAT are not expected from Alternative B compared to Alternative A (No Project). Also, emissions would likely be lower than present levels in the design year as a result of the EPA’s national control programs that are projected to reduce annual MSAT emissions by over 90 percent from 2010 to 2050 (FHWA 2016). Local conditions may differ from these national projections in terms of fleet mix and turnover, VMT growth rates, and local control measures. However, the magnitude of the EPA-projected reductions is so great (even after accounting for VMT growth) that MSAT emissions in the study area are likely to be lower in the future in virtually all locations. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the Alternative B mixed-use development sites would not expose sensitive receptors to air toxics, such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for exposure of sensitive receptors to air toxics as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of potential air toxics impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact as it relates to the exposure of sensitive receptors to air toxics. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development site as part of Alternative B would avoid exposure of sensitive receptors to air toxics such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Construction activities, intensity, and duration associated with the transportation improvements under this alternative would be the same as described above for Alternative B. Implementation of this alternative would result in similar increases in traffic as Alternative B, but peak ADT would also be below FHWA-recommended volumes of 140,000 AADT and ARB-recommended volumes of 100,000 ADT. Impacts would be same as Alternative B. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. The amount of MSAT emitted would be proportional to the VMT, assuming that other variables such as fleet mix remains the same as compared to Alternative A (No Project). While the highway realignment in Alternative C would result in a small increase in VMT when through trips are analyzed on their own, this alternative would also provide similar regional VMT benefits as Alternative B and higher levels of MSAT are not expected. Also, emissions would likely be lower than present levels in the design year as a result of the EPA’s national control programs that are projected to reduce annual MSAT emissions by over 90 percent from 2010 to 2050 (FHWA 2016).

Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact as it relates to the exposure of sensitive receptors to air toxics. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would avoid exposure of sensitive receptors to air toxics such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements Proposed construction activities and construction duration for Alternative D transportation improvements would be similar those for Alternative B. Implementation of Alternative D would result in similar increases in traffic as Alternative B, but peak ADT would also be below FHWA-recommended volumes of 140,000 AADT and ARB-recommended volumes of 100,000 ADT. Impacts would be same as Alternative B. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. The amount of MSAT emitted would be proportional to the VMT, assuming that other variables such as fleet mix remains the same as compared to Alternative A (No Project).

Implementation of Alternative E could result in minor increases in traffic, but peak ADT would also be below FHWA-recommended volumes of 140,000 AADT and ARB-recommended volumes of 100,000 ADT. Impacts would be same as Alternative B. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. The amount of MSAT emitted would be proportional to the VMT, assuming that other variables such as fleet mix remains the same as compared to Alternative A (No Project). This alternative would not include highway realignment or community revitalization elements and therefore would not provide similar VMT benefits as discussed under Alternative B. However, emissions would likely be lower than present levels in the design year as a result of the EPA’s national control programs that are projected to reduce annual MSAT emissions by over 90 percent from 2010 to 2050 (FHWA 2016).

If any new equipment is added after submission of the inventory, the prime contractor shall contact EDCAQMD before the new equipment is used. At least three business days before the use of subject heavy-duty off-road equipment, the project representative shall provide EDCAQMD with the anticipated construction timeline including start date, name, and phone number of the property owner, project manager, and onsite foreman.  Before approval of Grading Permits, the construction contractor shall submit for EDCAQMD approval, a written calculation demonstrating that the heavy-duty (> 50 horsepower) off-road vehicles to be used in the construction project, including owned, leased, and subcontractor vehicles, will achieve a project wide fleet-average 20 percent reduction in NOX emissions as compared to ARB statewide fleet average emissions.

mph = miles per hour Source: South Coast Air Quality Management District, Rule 403, June 2005  Significance after Mitigation Implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.13-1a would reduce NOX emissions from off-road equipment by 20 percent, 25 percent, or 60 percent depending on the construction activities that take place and specific measures implemented, as outlined by the measure. Based on the modeling conducted for the Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements, a 20 percent NOX reduction would result in maximum daily NOX emissions of 71 lb/day. If mixed-use development occurs as proposed, and not elsewhere to meet the replacement housing needs, a 25 percent reduction in NOX emissions would result in a maximum of 79 lb/day. If construction of the mixed-use development sites were to occur simultaneously with the transportation improvements, a 60 percent reduction would result in maximum daily NOX emissions of 79 lb/day. With incorporation of this measure, all construction-related emissions would be reduced to below EDCAQMD’s threshold of 82 lb/day. Because ROG emissions would not exceed applicable thresholds and NOX emissions would be reduced to levels below the significance thresholds for all build alternatives, CO emissions would also be considered less than significant (EDCAQMD 2002). Further, implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.13-1b would require all alternatives and the potential mixed-use development sites to incorporate and adhere to all available dust control measures, thus minimizing fugitive dust emissions such that PM10 and PM2.5 would not result in significant levels that could exceed ambient air quality standards. This impact would be reduced to a less-than-significant level for all build alternatives and associated mixed-use development, for purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, environmental consequences of implementing Alternatives B, C, D, and E with the implementation of Mitigation Measures 3.13-1a and 3.13-1b would not be adverse. 3.14 GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND CLIMATE CHANGE Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have the potential to adversely affect the environment, because they contribute, on a cumulative basis, to global climate change. In turn, global climate change has the potential to affect rain and snow fall, leading to changes in alpine hydrology and water supply; to affect habitat, leading to adverse effects on biological and other resources; and to change the frequency and duration of droughts, which can affect wildfire hazards and forest health.  Federal, state, and local regulations related to GHG emissions and climate change and potential impacts of the project alternatives are analyzed in this section. Because the nature of this issue is inherently cumulative, this section serves as the cumulative impact analysis related to GHGs and climate change. Therefore, the cumulative global climate change analysis presented in this section of the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS examines the GHG emissions associated with construction and operation-related activities of the US 50 South Shore Revitalization Project and its role in implementing statewide and regional plans that aim to reduce GHGs. The potential effects of global climate change on the project are also identified based on available scientific data. The cumulative project list applicable to global climate comprises anthropogenic (i.e., human-made) GHG emission sources across the globe, and no project alone would reasonably be expected to contribute to a noticeable incremental change to the global climate. However, legislation and executive orders on the subject of climate change in California have established a statewide context and a process for developing an enforceable statewide cap on GHG emissions. Similarly, implementation of the applicable regional transportation plan and sustainable communities’ strategy for the Tahoe Region established a regional context for addressing GHG emission associated with transportation and land use. Nevada follows the guidance of FHWA for climate change issues related to transportation projects. Given the nature of environmental consequences from GHGs and global climate change, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency’s (TRPA) environmental review process, NEPA, and CEQA require that lead agencies consider evaluating the cumulative impacts of GHGs, even in relatively small additions. Small contributions to this cumulative impact (from which significant effects are occurring and are expected to worsen over time) may be potentially considerable and, therefore, significant. 3.14.1 Regulatory Setting FEDERAL The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the federal agency responsible for implementing the federal Clean Air Act (CAA) and its amendments. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled on April 2, 2007 that carbon dioxide (CO2) is an air pollutant as defined under the CAA, and that EPA has the authority to regulate emissions of GHGs. The ruling in this case resulted in EPA taking steps to regulate GHG emissions and lent support for state and local agencies’ efforts to reduce GHG emissions. However, neither the EPA nor the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has issued explicit guidance or methods to conduct project-level GHG analysis. FHWA supports the approach that climate change considerations should be integrated throughout the transportation decision-making process, from planning through project development and delivery. Addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation up front in the planning process will assist in decision-making and improve efficiency at the program level, and will inform the analysis and stewardship needs of project-level decision-making. Climate change considerations can be integrated into many planning factors, such as supporting economic vitality and global efficiency, increasing safety and mobility, enhancing the environment, promoting energy conservation, and improving the quality of life. FHWA has outlined four strategies to lessen climate change impacts, which correlate with efforts that California and Nevada are undertaking to deal with transportation and climate change; these strategies include improved transportation system efficiency, cleaner fuels, cleaner vehicles, and a reduction in travel activity. Climate change and its associated effects are being addressed through various efforts at the federal level to improve fuel economy and energy efficiency, such as the “National Clean Car Program,” as discussed below, and Executive Order 13514 - Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance. This order is focused on reducing greenhouse gases internally in federal agency missions, programs, and operations, but also directs federal agencies to participate in the Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force, which is engaged in developing a national strategy for adaptation to climate change. National Program to Cut Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Improve Fuel Economy for Cars and Trucks On August 28, 2014, EPA and the Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) finalized a new national program that would reduce GHG emissions and improve fuel economy for all new cars and trucks sold in the U.S. (NHTSA 2012). EPA proposed the first-ever national GHG emissions standards under the CAA, and NHTSA proposed Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. This proposed national program allows automobile manufacturers to build a single light-duty national fleet that satisfies all requirements under both federal programs and the standards of California and other states. While this program will increase fuel economy to the equivalent of 54.5 miles per gallon for cars and light-duty trucks by Model Year 2025, additional phases are being developed by NHTSA and EPA that address GHG emission standards for new medium- and heavy-duty trucks (NHTSA 2014). Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule On September 22, 2009, EPA issued a final rule for mandatory reporting of GHGs from large GHG emissions sources in the United States. In general, this national reporting requirement will provide EPA with accurate and timely GHG emissions data from facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons (MT) or more of CO2 per year. This publicly available data will allow the reporters to track their own emissions, compare them to similar facilities, and aid in identifying cost effective opportunities to reduce emissions in the future. Reporting is at the facility level, except that certain suppliers of fossil fuels and industrial greenhouse gases along with vehicle and engine manufacturers will report at the corporate level. An estimated 85 percent of the total U.S. GHG emissions, from approximately 10,000 facilities, are covered by this final rule.  TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY TRPA has not specifically identified any goals or Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities related to GHG emissions or climate change at this time. The single policy in the Goals and Policies document pertaining to GHG emissions (Policy AQ-1.3) encourages the reduction of GHG emissions from motor vehicles and motorized machinery in the Tahoe Region. The TRPA Code of Ordinances includes a provision requiring that a GHG reduction strategy be incorporated into area plans adopted by local jurisdictions (TRPA Code Section 13.5.3.E) to reduce emissions of GHGs from the operation or construction of buildings. As part of the Lake Tahoe Sustainability Collaborative, TRPA participated in the preparation of the regional transportation plan for the Tahoe Region that includes strategies for reducing transportation-related GHGs (see below at Mobility 2035: Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan) and the Tahoe Sustainability Action Plan (see below at Tahoe Sustainability Action Plan).  Mobility 2035: Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan The Tahoe Metropolitan Planning Organization (TMPO) serves as the metropolitan planning organization (MPO) for El Dorado County within the Lake Tahoe Air Basin (LTAB) and would be applicable to the project. In 2012, the TMPO prepared the Mobility 2035: Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan (RTP)/Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS), which seeks to improve mobility and safety for the commuting public while at the same time delivering environmental improvements throughout the transportation network in the Lake Tahoe Basin (Basin). Important directions of the plan are to reduce the overall environmental impact of transportation in the Tahoe Region, create walkable, vibrant communities, and provide real alternatives to driving. The RTP establishes a target to reduce GHG emissions by 7 percent per capita reduction of GHGs by 2020 and by 5 percent per capita by 2035. The Basin is currently meeting these targets. The plan also supported an update of the Transportation Element of the TRPA Regional Plan. The RTP update included a Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS), in accordance with California Senate Bill 375 (Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act). The SCS demonstrates how integrated transportation, land use, and housing strategies will help the MPO Region meet environmental thresholds and greenhouse gas targets for cars and light trucks on the California side of the Basin by 2035. The RTP/SCS is integrated into TRPA’s Regional Plan.  2017 Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan Update The 2017 Regional Transportation Plan (2017 RTP), which is an update to the 2012 RTP, and its joint CEQA/TRPA environmental document have been circulated for public review. The vision and goals of the 2017 RTP were based on the 2012 RTP. The projects listed in the 2017 RTP are substantially similar to those in the 2012 RTP, and the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project is included in both documents. Best Construction Practices Policy for Construction Emissions TRPA coordinates implementation of its Best Construction Practices Policy for Construction Emissions through TRPA-approved plans, project-permitting, or projects/programs developed in coordination with local or other governments that require, as a condition of project approval, implementation of feasible measures and best management practices to reduce construction-generated emissions to the extent feasible (TRPA 2013). TRPA developed its Best Construction Practices Policy pursuant to Mitigation Measure 3.4-2 and Mitigation Measure 3.5-1 of the 2012 RTP/SCS Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement (EIR/EIS), and Mitigation Measure 3.4-2 of the Regional Plan Update EIS. Included in these measures are limits on idling time and the use of clean-fuel generators rather than diesel, which would be required for this project and would help reduce GHG emissions related to the construction of the build alternatives. STATE California California Executive Order S-3-05 Executive Order S-3-05, signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2005, proclaims that California is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. It declares that increased temperatures could reduce the Sierra Nevada snowpack, further exacerbate California’s air quality problems, and potentially cause a rise in sea levels. To combat those problems, the Executive Order established total GHG emission targets for the State. Specifically, emissions are to be reduced to the 2000 level by 2010, the 1990 level by 2020, and to 80 percent below the 1990 level by 2050.  As described below, legislation was passed in 2006 (Assembly Bill [AB] 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006) to limit GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 with continued “reductions in emissions” beyond 2020, but no specific additional reductions were enumerated in the legislation. Further, Senate Bill 375 (sustainable community strategies/transportation) established goals for emissions from light duty truck and automobiles for 2020 and 2035. California Executive Order B-30-15 On April 20, 2015 Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. signed Executive Order B-30-15 to establish a California GHG reduction target of 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. The Governor’s executive order aligns California’s GHG reduction targets with those of leading international governments such as the 28-nation European Union which adopted the same target in October 2014. California is on track to meet or exceed the current target of reducing GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, as established in the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Assembly Bill 32, discussed below). California’s new emission reduction target of 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 will make it possible to reach the ultimate goal of reducing emissions 80 percent under 1990 levels by 2050. This is in line with the scientifically established levels needed in the U.S. to limit global warming below 2°C—the warming threshold at which there will likely be major climate disruptions such as super droughts and rising sea levels according to scientific consensus.  California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Assembly Bill 32) In September 2006, Governor Schwarzenegger signed the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32). AB 32 establishes regulatory, reporting, and market mechanisms to achieve quantifiable reductions in GHG emissions and a cap on statewide GHG emissions. AB 32 requires that statewide GHG emissions be reduced to 1990 levels by 2020. AB 32 also requires that these reductions “…shall remain in effect unless otherwise amended or repealed. (b) It is the intent of the Legislature that the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit continue in existence and be used to maintain and continue reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases beyond 2020. (c) The (Air Resources Board) shall make recommendations to the Governor and the Legislature on how to continue reductions of greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2020.” [California Health and Safety Code, Division 25.5, Part 3, Section 38551]  In December 2008, ARB adopted its Climate Change Scoping Plan, which contains the main strategies California will implement to achieve reduction of approximately 118 million metric tons (MMT) of CO2-equivalent (CO2e) emissions, or approximately 21.7 percent from the state’s projected 2020 emission level of 545 MMT of CO2e under a business-as-usual scenario (this is a reduction of 47 MMT CO2e, or almost 10 percent, from 2008 emissions). ARB’s original 2020 projection was 596 MMT CO2e, but this revised 2020 projection takes into account the economic downturn that occurred in 2008 (ARB 2011). The Scoping Plan reapproved by ARB in August 2011 includes the Final Supplement to the Scoping Plan Functional Equivalent Document, which further examined various alternatives to Scoping Plan measures. The Scoping Plan also includes ARB-recommended GHG reductions for each emissions sector of the state’s GHG inventory. ARB estimates the largest reductions in GHG emissions to be achieved by 2020 will be by implementing the following measures and standards (ARB 2011):  improved emissions standards for light-duty vehicles (estimated reductions of 26.1 MMT CO2e),  the Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (15.0 MMT CO2e),  energy efficiency measures in buildings and appliances (11.9 MMT CO2e),   a renewable portfolio and electricity standards for electricity production (23.4 MMT CO2e), and  the Cap-and-Trade Regulation for certain types of stationary emission sources (e.g., power plants). In May 2014, ARB released and has since adopted the First Update to the Climate Change Scoping Plan to identify the next steps in reaching AB 32 goals and evaluate the progress that has been made between 2000 and 2012 (ARB 2014b:4 and 5). According to the update, California is on track to meet the near-term 2020 GHG limit and is well positioned to maintain and continue reductions beyond 2020 (ARB 2014b:ES-2). The update also reports the trends in GHG emissions from various emission sectors.  In 2016, SB 32 (discussed below) was passed, which codifies a 2030 GHG emissions reduction target of 40 percent below 1990 levels. Subsequently, in January 2017, ARB released the draft 2017 Climate Change Scoping Plan Update, which details California’s strategy for achieving 2030 greenhouse gas targets established under SB 32.  Senate Bill 32 In August 2016, Governor Brown signed SB 32 and AB 197, which serve to extend California’s GHG reduction programs beyond 2020. SB 32 amended the Health and Safety Code to include Section 38566, which contains language to authorize ARB to achieve a statewide GHG emission reduction of at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by no later than December 31, 2030. SB 32 codified the targets established by EO B-30-15 for 2030, which set the next interim step in the State’s continuing efforts to pursue the long-term target expressed in EOs S-3-05 and B-30-15 of 80 percent below 1990 emissions levels by 2050.  California Senate Bill 375 Senate Bill [SB] 375, signed by the Governor in September 2008, aligns regional transportation planning efforts, regional GHG emission reduction targets, and land use and housing allocation. SB 375 requires MPOs to develop an SCS or Alternative Planning Strategy, showing prescribed land use allocation in each MPO’s regional transportation plan. ARB, in consultation with the MPOs, is to provide each affected region with reduction targets for GHGs emitted by passenger cars and light trucks in their respective regions for 2020 and 2035. As discussed above, the TMPO 2012 RTP/SCS is the applicable regional plan for the project. With the assistance of the Regional Targets Advisory Committee (RTAC) and in consultation with the MPOs, ARB provided each affected region with reduction targets for GHGs emitted by passenger cars and light trucks in the region for the years 2020 and 2035. These reduction targets will be updated every 8 years, but can be updated every 4 years if advancements in emissions technologies affect the reduction strategies to achieve the targets. ARB is also charged with reviewing each MPO’s SCS consistency with its assigned targets. If MPOs do not meet the GHG reduction targets, transportation projects would not be eligible for funding programmed after January 1, 2012. The ARB-issued targets for the California portion of the Tahoe MPO are a 7 percent reduction in GHG emissions per capita by 2020 relative to 2005 per capita GHG emissions and a 5 percent reduction by 2035 (ARB 2011). California Advanced Clean Cars Program In January 2012, ARB approved the Advanced Clean Cars program which combines the control of GHG emissions and criteria air pollutants, as well as requirements for greater numbers of zero-emission vehicles, into a single package of standards for vehicle model years 2017 through 2025. By 2025, when the rules will be fully implemented, the statewide fleet of new cars and light trucks will emit 34 percent fewer global warming gases and 75 percent fewer smog-forming emissions than the statewide fleet in 2016 (ARB [no date]). California Renewable Energy Resources Act of 2011 (Senate Bill X1-2) SB X1-2 of 2011 requires all California utilities to generate 33 percent of their electricity from renewables by 2020. SB X1-2 sets a three-stage compliance period requiring all California utilities, including independently owned utilities, energy service providers, and community choice aggregators, to generate 20 percent of their electricity from renewables by December 31, 2013; 25 percent by December 31, 2016; and 33 percent by December 31, 2020. SB X1-2 also requires the renewable electricity standard to be met increasingly with renewable energy that is supplied to the California grid from sources within, or directly proximate to, California. SB X1-2 mandates that renewables from these sources make up at least 50 percent of the total renewable energy for the 2011-2013 compliance period, at least 65 percent for the 2014-2016 compliance period, and at least 75 percent for 2016 and beyond.  California Building Efficiency Standards of 2013 and 2016 (Title 24, Part 6) Buildings in California are required to comply with California’s Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential Buildings established by the CEC regarding energy conservation standards and found in Title 24, Part 6 of the California Code of Regulations. California’s Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential Buildings was first adopted in 1978 in response to a legislative mandate to reduce California’s energy consumption. The standards are updated on an approximately three-year cycle to allow consideration and possible incorporation of new energy efficient technologies and methods. All buildings for which an application for a building permit is submitted on or after July 1, 2014 must follow the 2013 standards (CEC 2012). Energy efficient buildings require less electricity; therefore, increased energy efficiency reduces fossil fuel consumption and decreases GHG emissions. The CEC Impact Analysis for California’s 2013 Building Energy Efficiency Standards estimates that the 2013 Standards are 23.3 percent more efficient than the previous 2008 standards for multi-family residential construction and 21.8 percent more efficient for non-residential construction (CEC 2013:3).  In addition, all buildings for which an application for a building permit is submitted on or after January 1, 2017 must comply with the 2016 standards (CEC 2016). The CEC 2016 Building Energy Efficiency Standards Adoption Hearing presentation estimates that the 2016 Standards are 28 percent more efficient than the previous 2013 standards for single-family residential construction and 5 percent more efficient for non-residential construction (CEC 2015). Thus, all proposed residential and commercial land uses will be required to comply with the most current building codes applicable at the time the permit applications are sought. Caltrans Guidance on Addressing Climate Change Adaptation in Regional Transportation Plans In February 2013, Caltrans published a report called Addressing Climate Change Adaptation in Regional Transportation Plans: A Guide for California MPOs and RTPAs (Caltrans 2013). This guide was written to help MPOs and regional transportation planning agencies (RTPAs) better incorporate climate assessment and adaptation into the long-range planning process. It discusses potential climate change-related impacts to transportation infrastructure in California and related adaptation strategies. Although there is no requirement to date to incorporate climate adaptation into regional transportation planning, this guide provides information and tools to help MPOs/RTPAs anticipate the incorporation of climate assessment and adaptation into future planning efforts. NEVADA The State of Nevada and its jurisdictions follow the air quality policies and regulations set forth by the FHWA and the EPA when evaluating the greenhouse gas emissions generated by the construction of road projects.  Since 1982, the TRPA, the California and Nevada bi-state regional environmental planning agency for the Lake Tahoe Region, has strived to meet two air quality threshold indicators: Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) and traffic counts. Both of these criteria should be reduced to 1981 levels. VMT have been decreasing in the Lake Tahoe Region over the last five years, and traffic counts, which, for the purposes of the threshold indicator, are measured at a location in South Lake Tahoe, are also trending downward. At the statewide level, on April 10, 2007, Nevada Governor Jim Gibbons signed an executive order that created the Nevada Climate Change Advisory Committee (NCCAC). The executive order directed the Committee to develop recommendations for reducing Nevada’s GHG emissions. The NCCAC released its final report on May 31, 2008 in which it identified recommendations to reduce GHG emissions in sectors such as agriculture, energy, waste management, commercial and residential building, and transportation. To assist in the reduction of GHG emissions within the transportation sector, the committee’s recommendations are intended to further efforts to supplement and diversify Nevada’s fuel supplies, and to reduce air pollutants and greenhouse gases. A few of the committee’s recommendations include the creation of a clean fuels and clean vehicle incentive program, as well as incentive programs for ethanol fuels and biodiesel fuels. The committee also recommends the State of Nevada monitor the status of California motor vehicle emissions standards for GHG emissions from motor vehicles. With regard to current road transportation projects, the Nevada Department of Transportation adheres to the policies and regulations of the PA and the FHWA for greenhouse gases. LOCAL El Dorado County Air Quality Management District EDCAQMD currently recommends that lead agencies use thresholds of significance for evaluating construction- and operation-related GHG emissions developed by Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD) and available in the SMAQMD CEQA Guide, last updated in November 2014 (Baughman, pers. comm., 2015). These thresholds were developed for the Sacramento metropolitan region and are intended to evaluate a project for consistency with GHG targets established in AB 32. Thresholds are included below in the Significance Criteria description. Tahoe Sustainability Action Plan The Tahoe Sustainability Action Plan was completed by the Lake Tahoe Sustainability Collaborative in December 2013 (Lake Tahoe Sustainability Collaborative 2013). The California Strategic Growth Council (SGC) funded the regional collaboration to develop sustainability tools for regional and local agencies, non-profits, the business community, and local residents to use in promoting greenhouse gas reduction, among other sustainability goals. The grant and planning effort was administered by the TMPO and was carried out by the Lake Tahoe Sustainability Collaborative, which is a public and private partnership that includes TRPA and was established to lead the development of sustainability tools and drive coordinated sustainability efforts. The sustainability tools in the Tahoe Sustainability Plan are intended to support development of economic incentives, GHG reduction strategies, and climate change adaptation strategies.  South Lake Tahoe General Plan The Natural and Cultural Resources Element of the South Lake Tahoe General Plan provides city-wide goals and polices aimed at reducing GHG emissions and promoting sustainable development (City of South Lake Tahoe 2011). Relevant goals and policies include incorporating bicycle and pedestrian facilities in city transportation planning and new development projects (Policy NCR-5.1), consideration of traffic-calming measures where needed (Policy NCR-5.5), encouraging interconnected bicycle, pedestrian, and bus transit circulation in development projects (NCR-5.8), supporting appropriately located mixed-use development sites within walking distance of each other (NCR-5.9), and mitigating carbon emissions during project-level CEQA review for individual projects (NCR-5.15). The General Plan also encourages conservation in new and existing development to reduce GHG emissions (Goal NCR-6); this goal is supported by policies that encourage use of “EPA Energy Star” certified appliances for new private development and public facilities (NCR-6.14), and a requirement to prepare a waste diversion plan to address the construction phase for certain projects (NCR-6.16). The full text of this goal and these policies, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with this goal and policy, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.” 3.14.2 Affected Environment EXISTING CLIMATE Climate is the accumulation of daily and seasonal weather events over a long period of time, whereas weather is defined as the condition of the atmosphere at any particular time and place (Ahrens 2003). Lake Tahoe lies in a depression between the crests of the Sierra Nevada and Carson ranges on the California-Nevada border at a surface elevation of approximately 6,260 feet above sea level. The LTAB is defined by the 7,000-foot contour, which is continuous around the Lake, except near Tahoe City. The mountains surrounding Lake Tahoe are approximately 8,000 to 9,000 feet in height on average, with some reaching 10,000 feet.  ATTRIBUTING CLIMATE CHANGE―THE PHYSICAL SCIENTIFIC BASIS Certain gases in the earth’s atmosphere, classified as GHGs, play a critical role in determining the earth’s surface temperature. Solar radiation enters the earth’s atmosphere from space. A portion of the radiation is absorbed by the earth’s surface and a smaller portion of this radiation is reflected back toward space. This absorbed radiation is then emitted from the earth as low-frequency infrared radiation. The frequencies at which bodies emit radiation are proportional to temperature. The earth has a much lower temperature than the sun; therefore, the earth emits lower frequency radiation. Most solar radiation passes through GHGs; however, infrared radiation is absorbed by these gases. As a result, radiation that otherwise would have escaped back into space is instead “trapped,” resulting in a warming of the atmosphere. This phenomenon, known as the greenhouse effect, is responsible for maintaining a habitable climate on earth. Without the greenhouse effect, earth would not be able to support life as we know it. Prominent GHGs contributing to the greenhouse effect are CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. Human-caused emissions of these GHGs in excess of natural ambient concentrations are believed responsible for intensifying the greenhouse effect and leading to a trend of unnatural warming of the earth’s climate, known as global climate change or global warming. It is “extremely likely” that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in GHG concentrations and other anthropogenic factors together (IPCC 2014:3, 5). Climate change is a global problem and GHGs are global pollutants, unlike criteria air pollutants and toxic air contaminants, which are pollutants of regional and local concern. Whereas pollutants with localized air quality effects have relatively short atmospheric lifetimes (about one day), GHGs have long atmospheric lifetimes (one to several thousand years). GHGs persist in the atmosphere for long enough time periods to be dispersed around the globe. Although the exact lifetime of any particular GHG molecule is dependent on multiple variables and cannot be pinpointed, it is understood that more CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere than is sequestered by ocean uptake, vegetation, and other forms of sequestration. Of the total annual human-caused CO2 emissions, approximately 55 percent is sequestered through ocean and land uptakes every year, averaged over the last 50 years, whereas the remaining 45 percent of human-caused CO2 emissions remains stored in the atmosphere (IPCC 2013:467). The quantity of GHGs that it takes to ultimately result in climate change is not precisely known; suffice it to say, the quantity is enormous, and no single project alone would measurably contribute to a noticeable incremental change in the global average temperature, or to global, local, or microclimates.  GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION SOURCES Emissions of GHGs contributing to global climate change are attributable in large part to human activities associated with the transportation, industrial/manufacturing, utility, residential, commercial, and agricultural emissions sectors (ARB 2014a). In the United States, the main source of GHG emissions is electricity generation, followed by transportation. In California, the transportation sector is the largest emitter of GHGs, followed by electricity generation (ARB 2014a). According to the NCCAC, the transportation sector in Nevada contributes 32 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in the state. Emissions of CO2 are byproducts of fossil fuel combustion. Methane, a highly potent GHG, primarily results from off-gassing (the release of chemicals from nonmetallic substances under ambient or greater pressure conditions) and is largely associated with agricultural practices and landfills. Nitrous oxide is also largely attributable to agricultural practices and soil management. CO2 sinks, or reservoirs, include vegetation and the ocean, which absorb CO2 through sequestration and dissolution (CO2 dissolving into the water), respectively, two of the most common processes for removing CO2 from the atmosphere. EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE ENVIRONMENT The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme to provide the world with a scientific view on climate change and its potential effects. According to the IPCC global average temperature is expected to increase relative to the 1986–2005 period by 0.3 to 4.8 degrees Celsius (°C) (0.5 to 8.6 degrees Fahrenheit [°F]) by the end of the 21st century (2081–2100), depending on future GHG emission scenarios (IPCC 2014:SPM-8). According to the California Natural Resources Agency, temperatures in California are projected to increase 2.7°F above 2000 averages by 2050 and, depending on emission levels, 4.1 to 8.6°F by 2100 (CNRA 2012:2). Physical conditions beyond average temperatures could be indirectly affected by the accumulation of GHG emissions. For example, changes in weather patterns resulting from increases in global average temperature are expected to result in a decreased volume of precipitation falling as snow in California and an overall reduction in snowpack in the Sierra Nevada. Based upon historical data and modeling, the California Department of Water Resources projects that the Sierra snowpack will experience a 25 to 40 percent reduction from its historic average by 2050 (DWR 2008:4). An increase in precipitation falling as rain rather than snow also could lead to increased potential for floods because water that would normally be held in the Sierra Nevada until spring could flow into the Central Valley concurrently with winter storm events (CNRA 2012:5). This scenario would place more pressure on California’s levee/flood control system. Another outcome of global climate change is sea level rise. Sea level rose approximately 7 inches during the last century and, assuming that sea-level changes along the California coast continue to track global trends, sea level along the state’s coastline in 2050 could be 10-18 inches higher than in 2000, and 31 to 55 inches higher by the end of this century (CNRA 2012:9). Changes in precipitation patterns and increased temperatures are expected to alter the distribution and character of natural vegetation and associated moisture content of plants and soils. An increase in frequency of extreme heat events and drought are also expected. These changes are expected to lead to increased frequency and intensity of large wildfires (CNRA 2012:11). 3.14.3 Environmental Consequences METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS Short-term, construction-related GHG emissions were calculated using the SMAQMD Roadway Construction Emissions Model (Version 8.1.0) for the transportation improvements and the California Emissions Estimator Model (CalEEMod) Version 2016.3.1 computer program (California Emissions Estimator Model [CAPCOA] 2016) for the mixed-use development sites, as recommended by EDCAQMD and other air districts in California. Modeling was based on project-specific information (e.g., length of road, area to be graded, area to be paved), where available; reasonable assumptions based on typical construction activities; and default values that are based on the project’s location and land use type. The modeling conservatively assumed that project construction/grading phases could begin as early as 2017 for both the transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites. Transportation improvements are anticipated to take up to three years and each mixed-use site was assumed to take up to one year to construct. Construction emissions were evaluated for the transportation improvements alone and in combination with the mixed-use development sites. Actual construction phasing and timing for each mixed-use site is unknown and thus all construction activities were summed and amortized over 25 years to represent annual emissions over the life of the project, consistent with SMAQMD guidance. Note that SMAQMD guidance allows non-residential projects to amortize construction emissions over 40 years. However, for a conservative estimate (i.e., to avoid the risk of understating an impact), a 25-year life span for residential projects was applied to all emissions modeling. For a detailed description of model input and output parameters and assumptions, refer to Appendix J. The potential for the project to result in an increase in operational GHG emissions is assessed qualitatively based on the VMT analysis provided in the traffic analysis prepared for the US 50/South Shore Revitalization Project (Wood Rodgers 2016) and the project is evaluated for its consistency with the RTP/SCS. In addition, this EIR/EIS/EIS evaluates whether the US 50/South Shore Revitalization Project would be substantially affected by environmental impacts exacerbated by climate change. This analysis is largely informed by Caltrans guidance on Addressing Climate Change Adaptation in Regional Transportation Plans (Cambridge Systematics 2013) discussed earlier in this section. SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA FHWA, TRPA, and EDCAQMD have not formally identified a significance threshold standard for analyzing GHG emissions generated by a project, or a methodology for analyzing impacts related to GHG emissions or global climate change.  NEPA Criteria FHWA and EPA do not provide significance criteria for GHG emissions analysis in NEPA documents. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) is the division of the Executive Office of the President that coordinates federal environmental efforts in the United States. CEQ finalized guidance for addressing GHG emissions in NEPA documents in 2016. The guidance does not include significance criteria, but directs federal agencies to disclose and carefully analyze emissions (CEQ 2016).  TRPA Criteria TRPA’s Initial Environmental Checklist does not contain any criteria that directly pertain to GHGs, climate change, or the adaptability of a project to climate change.  CEQA Criteria Based on Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines, the GHG emissions generated by a proposed project would result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to climate change if the project would:  generate greenhouse gas emissions, either directly or indirectly, that may have a significant adverse effect on the environment; or  conflict with an applicable plan, policy, or regulation adopted for the purpose of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases.  Thresholds of Significance Based on the available guidance and criteria described above, GHG emissions generated by a proposed project would result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to climate change if the project would:  result in construction-related GHG emissions that exceed SMAQMD recommended threshold of 1,100 MTCO2e/year. To assess consistency with California’s 2030 GHG target of 40 percent below 1990 levels, this threshold, established for the purpose of reducing 2020 statewide emission to 1990 levels, has been adjusted down by 40 percent to 660 MTCO2e/year; and  conflict with implementation of the adopted 2012 TRPA/TMPO RTP/SCS (i.e., Mobility 2035) or 2017 RTP, Senate Bill 375. ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF THE PROJECT ALTERNATIVES Impact 3.14-1: GHG emissions and consistency with the Regional Transportation Plan Implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D would result in realignment of US 50 and community revitalization that would be consistent with implementation of the RTP/SCS, which aims to achieve regional VMT (and associated GHG emissions) reduction targets. Therefore, Alternatives B, C, and D would help implement the RTP’s impact on regional VMT and related GHG emissions. There would be nominal construction-related GHG emissions of less than 1,100 MTCO2e/year and 660 MTCO2e/year (2030 adjusted threshold) for all the build alternatives. Implementation of Alternative A would not support the revitalization of the Tourist Core; it would retain the existing roadway system as is and existing traffic conditions, including existing levels of congestion and traffic flow but would not result in an increase in GHG emissions relative to existing conditions. For Alternative E, the existing roadway alignment would remain the same with separation of pedestrians on an elevated structure. It would not support revitalization in the Tourist Core as effectively as the realignment alternatives and the through-traffic trip length on US 50 would be unchanged as would VMT and related GHG emissions. NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives A, B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize GHG emissions such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations: Less Than Significant for Alternatives A, B, C, D, and E  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) This alternative would retain existing traffic conditions, including existing levels of congestion and traffic flow, and therefore could potentially prevent full, effective implementation of the RTP/SCS, which was adopted to improve connectivity, reliability, travel times, and operations of public transportation, and increase mobility and safety of bicycles and pedestrians to achieve reduction targets for VMT (and associated mobile-source GHGs). While Alternative A could potentially conflict with implementation of the RTP/SCS, it also would not result in an increase in VMT or GHG emissions relative to existing conditions. Therefore, this would be a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, Alternative A would avoid or minimize GHG emissions such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements GHG emissions for transportation projects can be divided into those generated during construction and those generated during operations. Construction activities that would generate GHG emissions include the use of off-road construction equipment, trucks hauling materials to and from the construction site, and commute trips by workers.  GHG emissions generated by construction would be primarily in the form of CO2. Emissions of other GHGs, such as methane and nitrous oxide, are also important with respect to global climate change; however, the emission levels of these other GHGs from on- and off-road vehicles used during construction are relatively small compared with the level of CO2 emissions, even when factoring in the relatively larger global warming potential of methane and nitrous oxide. Construction emissions were estimated using the Road Construction Emissions Model, Version 8.1.0, which is widely accepted by air districts in California, including EDCAQMD, for estimating emissions from linear construction projects, such as roadway widening and new roadway construction. Detailed modeling parameters are provided in Appendix J and modeling results are shown below in Table 3.14-1. Table 3.14-1 Estimated Greenhouse Gas Emissions Associated with Construction of Alternatives B, C, and D  Construction Activities  GHG Emissions (MTCO2e)  Total Demolition Phase Emission  53  Total Construction Phase Emissions  2,604  Total Construction Emissions over 3-year period  2,657  Annual Construction Emissions (amortized over 25 years)  106  EDCAQMD/SMAQMD Thresholds of Significance (MTCO2e/year)  1,100  Exceed Applicable Thresholds of Significance?  NO  Notes: MTCO2e = metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents EDCAQMD = El Dorado County Air Quality Management District  SMAQMD = Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District  Source: Compiled by Ascent Environmental, Inc. in 2016  Based on the modeling conducted, the total CO2 emissions for construction of Alternative B would be approximately 2,657 metric tons. Assuming a project life of 25 years, this would result in an average of 106 MTCO2e/year. These emission estimates do not account for any emission reductions that would result from implementation of TRPA’s Best Construction Practices Policy for Construction Emissions (e.g., minimizing idling time of diesel-powered equipment, utilizing electricity or clean-fuel generators rather than diesel, where feasible) and therefore actual emissions may be less than reported here. Nonetheless, estimated construction-related GHG emissions would not exceed applicable thresholds of significance (i.e., 1,100 MTCO2e/year for 2020 targets and 660 MTCO2e/year for 2030). Regarding project operations, implementation of Alternative B would result in realignment of US 50 and community revitalization that would be consistent with implementation of the RTP/SCS, which aims to achieve regional VMT (and associated GHG emissions) reduction targets. Moreover, VMT (and resultant GHG emissions) associated with the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project were evaluated in the analysis of the 2012 RTP/SCS EIR/EIS that determined an overall reduction in region-wide VMT (TMPO and TRPA 2012). This is noteworthy given that the RTP/SCS demonstrates how integrated transportation, land use, and housing strategies will help Lake Tahoe meet GHG targets for cars and light trucks on the California side of the Basin, as required by SB 375. In turn, because SB 375 is a component of the AB 32 Scoping Plan, Alternative B would also be consistent with the state’s plan to achieve AB 32-mandated emission reductions. Implementation of Alternative B would not prevent the TRPA region from reaching its goal of reducing VMT below 1981 levels.  In summary, because construction-related GHG emissions would be below SMAQMD thresholds, Alternative B would not result in a long-term increase in VMT or GHG emissions, and Alternative B is identified as part of the 2016 RTP/SCS, which aims to achieve reduction targets for mobile-source GHGs, and the transportation improvements alone do not introduce any new trip-generating land uses, implementation of Alternative B would not result in a considerable contribution to the cumulative adverse effect of climate change. Conversely, Alternative B would help implement the RTP/SCS’s beneficial impacts on regional VMT. Considering both construction and operation emissions, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the Alternative B transportation improvements would avoid or minimize GHG emissions such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-use Development including Replacement Housing In addition to the proposed realignment of US 50 and associated improvements discussed above, three individual mixed-use development sites could be developed. Each site would include a mix of commercial and residential land uses as well as a combination of on-site parking structures and parking lots to support the mixed-use development sites.  The maximum allowable development that could occur on the three sites collectively includes up to 227 housing units, 46,250 square feet of commercial space, and 534 parking spaces. For purposes of evaluating GHG impacts, this maximum potential was assumed for emissions modeling. Emissions were estimated for construction of each site individually and combined with the transportation improvements to represent complete build out of the alternatives. Detailed modeling parameters are provided in Appendix J and modeling results are shown below in Table 3.14-2. Table 3.14-2 Estimated Greenhouse Gas Emissions Associated with Construction of Mixed-Use Sites 1, 2, and 3  Construction Activities  GHG Emissions (MTCO2e)  Total Site 1 Construction Activities (assumed 1 year construction duration)  480  Total Site 2 Construction Activities (assumed 1 year construction duration)   424  Total Site 3 Construction Activities (assumed 1 year construction duration)  380  Total Mixed-Use Sites  1,284  Annual Construction Emissions Mixed-Use Sites Alone (amortized over 25 years)  51  Total Alternative B Transportation Improvements (From Table 3.14-1)  2,657  Annual Construction Emissions Mixed-Use + Roadway Alignments (amortized over 25 years)  157  EDCAQMD/SMAQMD Thresholds of Significance (MTCO2e/year)  1,100  Exceed Applicable Thresholds of Significance?  NO  Notes: MTCO2e = metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents EDCAQMD = El Dorado County Air Quality Management District  SMAQMD = Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District  CEQ = Council on Environmental Quality Source: Compiled by Ascent Environmental, Inc. in 2016  Based on the modeling conducted, the total CO2 emissions for each site individually would not exceed applicable thresholds of 1,100 MTCO2e/year (2020 target) or 660 MTCO2e/year (2030 target). When combined with emissions associated with transportation improvements and amortized over the life of the project, total CO2 emissions would still not exceed applicable thresholds for target years 2020 or 2030. These emission estimates do not account for any emission reductions that would result from implementation of TRPA’s Best Construction Practices Policy for Construction Emissions (e.g., minimizing idling time of diesel-powered equipment, utilizing electricity or clean-fuel generators rather than diesel, where feasible) and therefore actual emissions may be less than reported here. Nonetheless, construction-related GHG emissions would not exceed applicable threshold of significance. Operational-related GHG emissions associated with the proposed mixed-use development sites would result from energy use (i.e., electricity and natural gas), area sources (i.e., fireplaces and landscape maintenance equipment), and vehicle use (i.e., trip generation and VMT).  The mixed-use development sites would replace all existing residences and develop additional residential and retail/commercial space, resulting in a net increase in development over existing conditions. However, new construction would be required to comply with current California Title 24 Building Codes, which have been requiring substantial increases in building energy efficiency over time. Considering current standards, residential building codes result in up to a 65 percent reduction in electricity consumption and 39 percent in natural gas use when compared to standards in place at the time existing structures were built. For non-residential land uses, efficiency may be improved by 29 percent for electricity and 33 percent for natural gas (See Appendix J for calculations). Thus, although a net increase in development would occur, energy consumption in new structures would be substantially more efficient compared to existing structures. In addition, new buildings would be required to comply with current TRPA Code of Ordinances 65.1.4 Combustion Appliances, that require EPA-certified clean-burning wood heaters be installed in all new construction. Regarding mobile-source GHG emissions, the proposed mixed-use development sites would generate slightly more trips (locally) than the land uses they would replace (approximately 1,400 – 1,700 additional daily trips) (Wood Rodgers 2016). However, the type of compact mixed-use development that would occur at Sites 1, 2, and 3 are precisely the types of transit-oriented, urban infill development contemplated for this area in the Regional Plan and evaluated in the RPU EIS and 2012 RTP/SCS EIR/EIS, required to reduce region-wide VMT, by locating various land uses and amenities in close proximity to residences and existing development. Further, the mixed-use development sites are consistent with the compact development standards (e.g., density, height, and land coverage) in the TCAP and TRPA Code.  Although additional local VMT, and associated GHG emissions, may increase as a result of the mixed-use development sites, based on the VMT analysis for the entire region included in the RTP EIR/EIS, regional VMT targets would still be met. Further, new construction would be substantially more energy efficient than buildings that would be replaced. As the proposed mixed-use development sites would replace existing development and would be consistent with densities contemplated in the aforementioned planning documents and associated environmental analyses, the mixed-use development sites would not result in a net increase in operational GHG emissions that were not previously evaluated. Therefore, because similar land uses and development densities were accounted for in TRPA’s regional emissions analysis, the addition of these mixed-use development sites would help implement the RTP/SCS’s beneficial impact on regional VMT. Considering both construction and operation emissions, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the Alternative B mixed-use development sites would avoid or minimize GHG emissions such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar GHG emissions from construction and operation as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of potential GHG emissions would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development including replacement housing would result in a less-than-significant impact as it relates to GHG emissions.  For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid creating substantial GHG emissions such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Impacts would be the same as described for Alternative B because the duration and type of construction activities with the Alternative C transportation improvements would generally be the same as with Alternative B (see Table 3.14-1 for emissions estimate). Long-term operational impacts of Alternative C would be the same as described for Alternative B because the design concept and scope of Alternative C would also be consistent with the description of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project in the 2017 RTP/SCS, and the assumptions in TMPO’s regional emissions analysis. Implementation of this alternative would not conflict with applicable plans, policies, or regulations adopted for the purpose of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. Conversely, Alternative C would help implement the RTP/SCS’s beneficial impact on regional VMT. Considering both construction and operation emissions, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the Alternative C transportation improvements would avoid or minimize GHG emissions such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-use Development including Replacement Housing Impacts would be the same as described for Alternative B because the duration and type of construction activities that would occur with Alternative C would generally be the same as with Alternative B (See Table 3.14-2 for emissions estimate). Operation of the mixed-use development would also be the same as Alternative B and therefore this alternative would not conflict with plans, policies, or regulations adopted for the purpose of reducing GHG emissions. Conversely, as with Alternative B, the mixed-use development sites associated with Alternative C would help implement the RTP/SCS’s beneficial impact on regional VMT. Considering both construction and operation emissions, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the Alternative C mixed-use development sites would avoid or minimize GHG emissions such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar GHG emissions from construction and operation as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of potential GHG emissions would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development including replacement housing would result in a less-than-significant impact as it relates to GHG emissions.  For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would avoid creating substantial GHG emissions such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements Alternative D is similar to Alternative B in that it would construct a new alignment for US 50 to the southeast of existing US 50 from the Pioneer Trail intersection in California to Lake Parkway in Nevada. The relocated US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection would be further east than the Alternative B alignment, and would cut through the business triangle preserved by Alternative B. Proposed construction activities and construction duration would be similar with this alternative as compared to Alternative B (See Table 3.14-1 for emissions estimate). Long-term operational impacts of Alternative D would be the same as described for Alternative B because the design concept and scope of Alternative D would also be generally consistent with the description of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project in the 2017 RTP/SCS, and the assumptions in TMPO’s regional emissions analysis. Implementation of this alternative would not conflict with applicable plans, policies, or regulations adopted for the purpose of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. Considering both construction and operation emissions, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the Alternative D transportation improvements would avoid or minimize GHG emissions such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative D includes the redevelopment of three sites within the project site similar to Alternative B. Because the highway realignment differs from Alternative B, the configuration of Sites 1 and 2 are different for Alternative D. The maximum amount of development that could occur on these three sites with Alternative D would be the same as that described above for Alternative B. Therefore, maximum construction-related emissions and associated impacts would be the same (see Table 3.14-2 for emissions estimate). Operation of the mixed-use development would also be the same as Alternative B and therefore this alternative would not conflict with plans, policies, or regulations adopted for the purpose of reducing GHG emissions. Conversely, as with Alternative B, the mixed-use development sites associated with Alternative D would help implement the RTP/SCS’s beneficial impact on regional VMT. Considering both construction and operation emissions, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the Alternative D mixed-use development sites would avoid or minimize GHG emissions such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar GHG emissions from construction and operation as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of potential GHG emissions would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development including replacement housing would result in a less-than-significant impact as it relates to GHG emissions.  For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would avoid creating substantial GHG emissions such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E would feature a concrete deck over the entire width and length of existing US 50 within the Tourist Core between a location about 100 feet south of Stateline Avenue and a location near the northern end of the Montbleu Resort (about 450 feet south of Lake Parkway). The deck would serve as a pedestrian “skywalk” facility or raised pedestrian walkway along the casino core. The width would be approximately 75 feet. The skywalk would be constructed on 4-feet wide columns spaced approximately 20 feet on center running along both sides of the highway for the entire length of the bridge. Construction-related emissions associated with this alternative are shown below in Table 3.14-3.  Based on the modeling, the total CO2 emissions for construction of Alternative E would be approximately 574 metric tons. Assuming a project life of 25 years, this would result in an average of 23 MTCO2e/year. These emission estimates do not account for any emission reductions that would result from implementation of TRPA’s Best Construction Practices Policy for Construction Emissions (e.g., minimizing idling time of diesel-powered equipment, utilizing electricity or clean-fuel generators rather than diesel, where feasible) and therefore actual emissions may be less than reported here. Nonetheless, estimated construction-related GHG emissions would not exceed applicable thresholds of significance. Further, operation of Alternative E would not result in any increases in local or regional VMT. No mixed-use development is proposed with this alternative. Implementation of this alternative would not result in substantial GHG emissions or conflict with plans, policies, or regulations adopted for the purpose of reducing GHG emissions. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Table 3.14-3 Estimated Greenhouse Gas Emissions Associated with Construction of Alternative E  Construction Activities  GHG Emissions (MTCO2e)  Total Construction Emissions 3-year period  574  Emissions MTCO2e/year  23  EDCAQMD/SMAQMD Thresholds of Significance (MTCO2e/year)  1,100  Exceed Applicable Thresholds of Significance?  NO  Notes: MTCO2e = metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents EDCAQMD = El Dorado County Air Quality Management District  SMAQMD = Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District  Source: Compiled by Ascent Environmental, Inc. in 2016   Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, Alternative E would avoid or minimize GHG emissions such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Impact 3.14-2: Vulnerability to climate change risks Climate change is expected to result in a variety of effects in the study area including increased frequency and intensity of wildfires, changes to timing and intensity of precipitation resulting in increased risk from landslides associated with ground saturation, increased stormwater runoff, and increased intensity of storm events that result in increased snow loading and high winds. However, there are numerous programs and policies in place, as well as design measures that would protect against these climate change risks.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize vulnerability to climate change risks such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations: Less than Significant for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; No Impact for Alternative A. Climate change adaptation for transportation infrastructure involves long-term planning and risk management to address vulnerabilities in the transportation system from increased precipitation and flooding; the increased frequency and intensity of storms and wildfires; rising temperatures; and rising sea levels.  The project is located in an urbanized area where chances of wildland fire are typically reduced relative to a forested area and emergency response personnel are more readily available. Further, TRPA, El Dorado County, and Douglas County have adopted plans and policies to manage and plan for wildland fire. These include TRPA’s Community Wildfire Protection Plan and TRPA’s Fuel Reduction and Forest Restoration Plan; the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection’s (CALFIRE) Plans for El Dorado County; and the Nevada Hazard Mitigation Plan in Douglas County (see Section 3.12, “Hazards, Hazardous Materials, and Risk of Upset,” for additional information on plans and policies related to wildland fire). Implementation of these plans would reduce the likelihood of wildland fire through management of fuels and implementation of best practices and would ensure that resources to respond to the occurrence of a wildland fire would be available. Therefore, it is not anticipated that the study area would be substantially affected by exposure to wildfire as a result of climate change impacts.  Potential impacts associated with changing storm and precipitation patterns are addressed below, for each alternative. Alternative A: No Build (No Project) With Alternative A there would be no improvements to existing US 50, Lake Parkway, or other roadways within the project site, and no new land use development. As no project would be implemented, there would be no new development or land uses that could be affected by climate change. There would be no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements  Implementation of this alternative would result in slightly more roadway length (i.e., 0.4 mile) on US 50. However, travel lanes would be reduced on existing US 50 so overall surface area of impervious surfaces would remain relatively similar to existing conditions. The proposed pedestrian bridge would be elevated and would not be prone to flooding. In addition, landscaping improvements, such as the addition of street trees, decorative vegetation, and landscaped medians, would be included throughout the project site with this alternative. Further, the project would include various improvements that would help with storm water retention, such as sediment traps, infiltration basins, and sand traps (Wood Rogers 2016b). All of these improvements would help capture and reduce stormwater runoff. As discussed in Section 3.11, “Geology, Soils, Land Capability, and Coverage,” the project site is not located on sloping ground that is potentially subject to landslides, rock falls, and debris/earth flows, which could become more frequent or severe as storm patterns change. Also, the project would not place facilities in locations with increased avalanche risk relative to existing conditions. For these reasons, changes in local weather patterns as a result of climate change would not be expected to have a substantial impact on the project. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the Alternative B transportation improvements would avoid or minimize vulnerability to climate change risks such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-use Development including Replacement Housing The addition of the mixed-use development would result in the replacement of existing residential land uses with a mix of residential and commercial/retail uses. Because these redevelopment sites would replace existing housing and would be designed to meet existing building standards, they would not result in substantial population growth in the area and therefore would not be exposing additional people to potential risks from climate change. The same design components described above would also be implemented. Therefore, impacts would be the same. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the Alternative B mixed-use development sites would avoid or minimize vulnerability to climate change risks such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar climate change risks as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of climate change risks would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development including replacement housing would result in a less-than-significant impact as it relates to vulnerability to climate change risks.  For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize vulnerability to climate change risks such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements The alignment of Alternative C would be the same as Alternative B for the route along existing Montreal Road and Lake Parkway. However, Alternative C would involve one-way travel within the Tourist Core and on the realigned highway to the southeast. All improvements associated with landscaping and stormwater retention would also be included. Therefore, impacts would be the same as Alternative B. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the Alternative C transportation improvements would avoid or minimize vulnerability to climate change risks such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement Mixed-use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative C includes the redevelopment of the same three sites within the project site as Alternative B. Therefore, impacts would be the same. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the Alternative C mixed-use development sites would avoid or minimize vulnerability to climate change risks such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar climate change risks as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of climate change risks would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development including replacement housing would result in a less-than-significant impact as it relates to vulnerability to climate change risks.  For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would avoid or minimize vulnerability to climate change risks such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements Alternative D is similar to Alternative B in that it would construct a new alignment for US 50 to the southeast of existing US 50 from the Pioneer Trail intersection in California to Lake Parkway in Nevada. The relocated US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection would be further east than the Alternative B alignment, and would cut through the business triangle preserved by Alternative B. Nonetheless, similar improvements associated with landscaping and stormwater retention as alternative B would be included. Therefore, impacts would be the same as Alternative B. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the Alternative D transportation improvements would avoid or minimize vulnerability to climate change risks such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative D would also include development of the same three sites, however different site configuration would be required because the highway alignment also differs with this alternative. Nonetheless, similar improvements associated with landscaping and stormwater retention as Alternative B would be included. Therefore, impacts would be the same as Alternative B. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the Alternative D mixed-use development sites would avoid or minimize vulnerability to climate change risks such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar climate change risks as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of climate change risks would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development including replacement housing would result in a less-than-significant impact as it relates to vulnerability to climate change risks.  For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would avoid or minimize vulnerability to climate change risks such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative E: Skywalk This alternative would not include any new roadway alignments or associated improvements. The new pedestrian bridge would be elevated and would not be susceptible to increased flooding. Impacts to this alternative from climate change would not be likely. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize vulnerability to climate change risks such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. 3.14.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures No avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures are required to reduce greenhouse gas and climate change effects such that there would not be an adverse effect for the purposes of NEPA or to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. 3.15 NOISE AND VIBRATION This section includes definitions of common descriptions for noise and ground vibration; descriptions of applicable regulations, acoustic fundamentals, and existing ambient noise conditions; and an analysis of potential short- and long-term noise and vibration impacts associated with implementation of the project alternatives.  Comments received on the Notice of Preparation related to noise addressed the potential noise effects on wildlife. Potential effects of the project alternatives on wildlife are addressed in Section 3.16, “Biological Environment.” None of the alternatives would locate noise-sensitive uses where they would be subject to single-event noise level concerns and none of the alternatives would be expected to affect the frequency or intensity of single‐event noise incidences. None of the alternatives would affect the type or number of aircraft operations at Lake Tahoe Airport. Similarly, no changes to levels of activity by recreational watercraft, motorcycles, off-road vehicles, and over‐snow vehicles are anticipated with any of the alternatives because they are not expected to result in additional recreational boating facilities, trails, or recreation areas for these types of vehicles. Furthermore, the types of recreational watercraft, motorcycles, off‐road vehicles, and over‐snow vehicles, as well as on‐road vehicles, would not change as a result of any of the alternatives. TRPA single-event noise standards, shown in Table 3.15-4 below, would continue to apply to all of these noise sources. These issues are not addressed further. The project site is not located in the planning area of the Lake Tahoe Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan (City of South Lake Tahoe 2007), the land use plan of any other airport, or within the vicinity of an active private airstrip where people would be exposed to excessive aircraft-generated noise levels. This issue is not addressed further. 3.15.1 Regulatory Setting Key federal, state, and local regulatory and conservation planning issues applicable to the project for noise-related impacts are discussed below. Prior to discussing these issues, background information on acoustical fundamentals is needed to place the regulatory and planning issues into perspective. SOUND, NOISE, AND ACOUSTICS Sound can be described as the mechanical energy of a vibrating object transmitted by pressure waves through a liquid or gaseous medium (e.g., air) to a hearing organ, such as a human ear. Noise is defined as loud, unexpected, or annoying sound. In the science of acoustics, the fundamental model consists of a sound (or noise) source, a receiver, and the propagation path between the two. The loudness of the noise source and obstructions or atmospheric factors affecting the propagation path to the receiver determines the sound level and characteristics of the noise perceived by the receiver. The field of acoustics deals primarily with the propagation and control of sound. FREQUENCY Continuous sound can be described by frequency (pitch) and amplitude (loudness). A low-frequency sound is perceived as low in pitch. Frequency is expressed in terms of cycles per second, or hertz (Hz) (e.g., a frequency of 250 cycles per second is referred to as 250 Hz). High frequencies are sometimes more conveniently expressed in kilohertz, or thousands of hertz. The audible frequency range for humans is generally between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. SOUND PRESSURE LEVELS AND DECIBELS The amplitude of pressure waves generated by a sound source determines the loudness of that source. Sound pressure amplitude is measured in micro-Pascals (mPa). One mPa is approximately one hundred billionth (0.00000000001) of normal atmospheric pressure. Sound pressure amplitudes for different kinds of noise environments can range from less than 100 to 100,000,000 mPa. Because of this huge range of values, sound is rarely expressed in terms of mPa. Instead, a logarithmic scale is used to describe sound pressure level (SPL) in terms of decibels (dB). The threshold of hearing for young people is about 0 dB, which corresponds to 20 mPa. ADDITION OF DECIBELS Because decibels are logarithmic units, SPL cannot be added or subtracted through ordinary arithmetic. With the decibel scale, a doubling of sound energy corresponds to a 3-dB increase. In other words, when two identical sources are each producing sound of the same loudness, the resulting sound level at a given distance would be 3 dB higher than one source under the same conditions. For example, if one automobile produces an SPL of 70 dB when it passes an observer, two cars passing simultaneously would not produce 140 dB; rather, they would combine to produce 73 dB. With the decibel scale, three sources of equal loudness together produce a sound level 5 dB louder than one source. A-WEIGHTED DECIBELS The decibel scale alone does not adequately characterize how humans perceive noise. The dominant frequencies of a sound have a substantial effect on the human response to that sound. Although the intensity (energy per unit area) of the sound is a purely physical quantity, the loudness or human response is determined by the characteristics of the human ear. Human hearing is limited in the range of audible frequencies as well as in the way it perceives the SPL in that range. In general, people are most sensitive to the frequency range of 1,000–8,000 Hz, and perceive sounds within that range better than sounds of the same amplitude in higher or lower frequencies. To approximate the response of the human ear, sound levels of individual frequency bands are weighted, depending on the human sensitivity to those frequencies. Then, an “A-weighted” sound level (expressed in units of A-weighted decibels) can be computed based on this information. The A-weighting network approximates the frequency response of the average young ear when listening to most ordinary sounds. When people make judgments of the relative loudness or annoyance of a sound, their judgment correlates well with the A-scale sound levels of those sounds. Other weighting networks have been devised to address high noise levels or other special problems (e.g., B-, C-, and D-scales), but these scales are rarely used in conjunction with highway-traffic noise. Noise levels for traffic noise reports are typically reported in terms of A-weighted decibels. Table 3.15-1 describes typical A-weighted noise levels for various noise sources. All sound levels expressed as dB in this section are A-weighted sound levels. Table 3.15-1 Typical A-Weighted Noise Levels  Common Outdoor Activities  Noise Level (dB)  Common Indoor Activities    — 110 —  Rock band  Jet fly-over at 1,000 feet        — 100 —    Gas lawn mower at 3 feet        — 90 —    Diesel truck at 50 feet at 50 miles per hour    Food blender at 3 feet    — 80 —  Garbage disposal at 3 feet  Noisy urban area, daytime      Gas lawn mower, 100 feet  — 70 —  Vacuum cleaner at 10 feet  Commercial area    Normal speech at 3 feet  Heavy traffic at 300 feet  — 60 —        Large business office  Quite urban daytime  — 50 —  Dishwasher next room        Quite urban nighttime  — 40 —  Theater, large conference room (background)  Quite suburban nighttime        — 30 —  Library  Quite rural nighttime    Bedroom at night, concert    — 20 —        Broadcast/recording studio    — 10 —          Lowest threshold of human hearing  — 0 —  Lowest threshold of human hearing  Notes: dB = A-weighted Noise Levels Source: California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) 2013a:2-20  HUMAN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN NOISE LEVELS As discussed above, the doubling of sound energy results in a 3-dB increase in sound. However, given a sound level change measured with precise instrumentation, the subjective human perception of a doubling of loudness will usually be different from what is measured. Under controlled conditions in an acoustical laboratory, the trained, healthy human ear is able to discern 1-dB changes in sound levels when exposed to steady, single-frequency (“pure-tone”) signals in the mid-frequency (1,000–8,000 Hz) range. In typical noisy environments, changes in noise of 1–2 dB are generally not perceptible. However, it is widely accepted that people are able to begin to detect sound level increases of 3 dB in typical noisy environments. Further, a 5-dB increase is generally perceived as a readily noticeable increase, and a 10-dB increase is generally perceived as a doubling of loudness. Therefore, a doubling of sound energy (e.g., doubling the volume of traffic on a highway) that would result in a 3-dB increase in sound would generally be perceived as barely perceptible (Caltrans 2013a:2-45). VIBRATION Vibration is the periodic oscillation of a medium or object with respect to a given reference point. Sources of vibration include natural phenomena (e.g., earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, sea waves, landslides) and those introduced by human activity (e.g., explosions, machinery, traffic, trains, construction equipment). Vibration sources may be continuous, (e.g., operating factory machinery or transient in nature, explosions). Vibration levels can be depicted in terms of amplitude and frequency, relative to displacement, velocity, or acceleration. Vibration amplitudes are commonly expressed in peak particle velocity (PPV) or root-mean-square (RMS) vibration velocity. PPV is defined as the maximum instantaneous positive or negative peak of a vibration signal. PPV is typically used in the monitoring of transient and impact vibration and has been found to correlate well to the stresses experienced by buildings (Federal Transit Administration [FTA] 2006:7-3; Caltrans 2013b:6). PPV and RMS vibration velocity are normally described in inches per second (in/sec). Although PPV is appropriate for evaluating the potential for building damage, it is not always suitable for evaluating human response. It takes some time for the human body to respond to vibration signals. In a sense, the human body responds to average vibration amplitude. The RMS of a signal is the average of the squared amplitude of the signal, typically calculated over a 1-second period. As with airborne sound, the RMS velocity is often expressed in decibel notation as vibration decibels (VdB), which serves to compress the range of numbers required to describe vibration (FTA 2006:7-3). This is based on a reference value of 1 micro inch per second (μin/sec). The typical background vibration-velocity level in residential areas is approximately 50 VdB. Groundborne vibration is normally perceptible to humans at approximately 65 VdB. For most people, a vibration-velocity level of 75 VdB is the approximate dividing line between barely perceptible and distinctly perceptible levels (FTA 2006:7-8). Typical outdoor sources of perceptible ground vibration are construction equipment, steel-wheeled trains, and traffic on rough roads. If a roadway is smooth, the ground vibration is rarely perceptible. The range of interest is from approximately 50 VdB, which is the typical background vibration-velocity level, to 100 VdB, which is the general threshold where minor damage can occur in fragile buildings. Construction activities can generate ground vibrations, which can pose a risk to nearby structures. Constant or transient vibrations can weaken structures, crack facades, and disturb occupants. Construction vibrations can be transient, random, or continuous. Transient construction vibrations are generated by blasting, impact pile driving, and wrecking balls. Continuous vibrations result from vibratory pile drivers, large pumps, and compressors. Random vibration can result from jackhammers, pavement breakers, and heavy construction equipment. Table 3.15-2 describes the general human response to different levels of ground vibration-velocity levels. Table 3.15-2 Human Response to Different Levels of Ground Noise and Vibration  Vibration-Velocity Level  Human Reaction  65 VdB  Approximate threshold of perception.  75 VdB  Approximate dividing line between barely perceptible and distinctly perceptible. Many people find that transportation-related vibration at this level is unacceptable.  85 VdB  Vibration acceptable only if there are an infrequent number of events per day.  Notes: VdB = vibration decibels referenced to 1 μ inch/second and based on the root mean square (RMS) velocity amplitude. Source: FTA 2006:7-5  COMMON NOISE DESCRIPTORS Noise in our daily environment fluctuates over time. Some fluctuations are minor, but some are substantial. Some noise levels occur in regular patterns, but others are random. Some noise levels fluctuate rapidly, but others fluctuate slowly. Some noise levels vary widely, but others are relatively constant. Various noise descriptors have been developed to describe time-varying noise levels. The following are the noise descriptors most commonly used in traffic noise analysis. Equivalent Continuous Sound Level (Leq): Leq represents an average of the sound energy occurring over a specified period. In effect, Leq is the steady-state sound level containing the same acoustical energy as the time-varying sound that actually occurs during the same period. The 1-hour A-weighted equivalent sound level (Leq[h]) is the energy average of A-weighted sound levels occurring during a 1-hour period and is the basis for noise abatement criteria (NAC) used by Caltrans and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Percentile-Exceeded Sound Level (LXX): LXX represents the sound level exceeded for a given percentage of a specified period (e.g., L10 is the sound level exceeded 10 percent of the time, and L90 is the sound level exceeded 90 percent of the time). Maximum Sound Level (Lmax): Lmax is the highest instantaneous sound level measured during a specified period. Day-Night Level (Ldn): Ldn is the energy average of A-weighted sound levels occurring over a 24-hour period, with a 10-dB “penalty” applied to A-weighted sound levels occurring during nighttime hours between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) or Day-Evening-Night Level (Lden): Similar to Ldn, CNEL or Lden is the energy average of the A-weighted sound levels occurring over a 24-hour period, with a 10-dB penalty applied to A-weighted sound levels occurring during the nighttime hours between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. and a 5-dB penalty applied to the A-weighted sound levels occurring during evening hours between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. SOUND PROPAGATION When sound propagates over a distance, it changes in level and frequency content. The manner in which noise reduces with distance depends on the following factors. Geometric Spreading Sound from a localized source (i.e., a point source) propagates uniformly outward in a spherical pattern. The sound level attenuates (or decreases) at a rate of 6 dB for each doubling of distance from a point source. Highways consist of several localized noise sources on a defined path and hence can be treated as a line source, which approximates the effect of several point sources. Noise from a line source propagates outward in a cylindrical pattern, often referred to as cylindrical spreading. Sound levels attenuate at a rate of 3 dB for each doubling of distance from a line source. Ground Absorption The propagation path of noise from a highway to a receiver is usually very close to the ground. Noise attenuation from ground absorption and reflective-wave canceling adds to the attenuation associated with geometric spreading. Traditionally, the excess attenuation has also been expressed in terms of attenuation per doubling of distance. This approximation is usually sufficiently accurate for distances of less than 200 feet. For acoustically hard sites (i.e., sites with a reflective surface between the source and the receiver, such as a parking lot or body of water), no excess ground attenuation is assumed. For acoustically absorptive or soft sites (i.e., those sites with an absorptive ground surface between the source and the receiver, such as soft dirt, grass, or scattered bushes and trees), an excess ground-attenuation value of 1.5 dB per doubling of distance is normally assumed. When added to the cylindrical spreading, the excess ground attenuation results in an overall drop-off rate of 4.5 dB per doubling of distance. Atmospheric Effects Receivers located downwind from a source can be exposed to increased noise levels relative to calm conditions, whereas locations upwind can have lowered noise levels. Sound levels can be increased at large distances (e.g., more than 500 feet) from the highway because of atmospheric temperature inversion (i.e., increasing temperature with elevation). Other factors such as air temperature, humidity, and turbulence can also have significant effects. Shielding by Natural or Human-Made Features A large object or barrier in the path between a noise source and a receiver can substantially attenuate noise levels at the receiver. The amount of attenuation provided by shielding depends on the size of the object and the frequency content of the noise source. Natural terrain features (e.g., hills and dense woods) and human-made features (e.g., buildings and walls) can substantially reduce noise levels. Walls are often constructed between a source and a receiver specifically to reduce noise. A barrier that breaks the line of sight between a source and a receiver will typically result in at least 5 dB of noise reduction. Taller barriers provide increased noise reduction. Vegetation between the highway and receiver is rarely effective in reducing noise because it does not create a solid barrier. FEDERAL The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) provide the broad basis for analyzing and abating highway traffic noise effects. The intent of these laws is to inform government decision-making regarding potential environmental impacts, alternatives, and mitigation measures, if needed. The requirements for noise analysis and consideration of noise abatement and/or mitigation, however, differ between NEPA, TRPA regulations, and CEQA. Highway Traffic Noise Regulation (23 CFR 772) This regulation provides procedures for preparing operational and construction noise studies and evaluating noise abatement considered for federal and federal-aid highway projects. Under 23 CFR 772.7, projects are categorized as Type 1, Type 2, or Type 3 projects. FHWA defines a Type 1 project as a proposed federal or federal-aid highway project for the construction of a highway on a new location, or the physical alteration of an existing highway where there is either substantial horizontal or substantial vertical alteration, or increases the number of through-traffic lanes. A Type 2 project is a noise barrier retrofit project that involves no changes to highway capacity or alignment. A Type 3 project is a project that does not meet the classifications of a Type 1 or Type 2 project. Type 3 projects do not require a noise analysis. Type 1 projects include the addition of through traffic lanes that function as high-occupancy vehicle lanes, high-occupancy toll lanes, bus lanes, or truck climbing lanes. Type 1 projects include the addition of an auxiliary lane (except when an auxiliary lane is a turn lane); addition or relocation of interchange lanes or ramps; restriping existing pavement for the purpose of adding a through-traffic lane or auxiliary lane; and the addition of a new or substantial alteration of a weigh station, rest stop, ride-share lot, or toll plaza. Projects unrelated to increased noise levels, such as striping, lighting, signing, and landscaping projects, are not considered Type 1 projects.  Alternatives B, C, and D include realignment of US 50 with substantial horizontal alteration. Therefore, the realignments of US 50 with Alternatives B, C, and D are considered to be Type 1 projects. Alternatives A and E are Type 3 projects. The mixed-use land uses, including replacement housing, at any of the three redevelopment sites identified as part of Alternatives B, C, and D are also considered Type 3 projects and, therefore, do not require a noise analysis for FHWA.  In accordance with 23 CFR 772.11, noise abatement must be considered for Type 1 projects that result in a traffic noise impact. In such cases, 23 CFR 772 requires that the project proponent “consider” noise abatement before adoption of the final NEPA document. This process involves identification of noise abatement measures that are reasonable, feasible, and likely to be incorporated into the project, and of noise impacts for which no apparent solution is available. Traffic noise impacts, as defined in 23 CFR 772.5, occur when the predicted noise level in the design year approaches or exceeds the NAC specified in 23 CFR 772, or a predicted noise level substantially exceeds the existing noise level (i.e., a “substantial” noise increase). Design year is defined in 23 CFR 772.5 as “the future year used to estimate the probable traffic volume for which a highway is designed. A time, 10 to 20 years, from the start of construction is usually used” (CFR 772.5a). Year 2040 is the design year for this project (Wood Rodgers 2016:22).  The NAC shown in Table 3.15-3 correspond to various land use activity categories. The NAC use an Leq[h] metric, which is the average of sound levels occurring during a 1-hour period. Activity categories and related traffic noise impacts are determined based on the actual land use in a given area.  Table 3.15-3 Federal Highway Administration’s Activity Categories and Noise Abatement Criteria  Activity Category  Activity Leq[h]  Evaluation Location  Description of Activities  A  57  Exterior  Lands on which serenity and quiet are of extraordinary significance and serve an important public need and where the preservation of those qualities is essential if the area is to continue to serve its intended purpose.  B2  67  Exterior  Residential.  C2  67  Exterior  Active sport areas, amphitheaters, auditoriums, campgrounds, cemeteries, day care centers, hospitals, libraries, medical facilities, parks, picnic areas, places of worship, playgrounds, public meeting rooms, public or nonprofit institutional structures, radio studios, recording studios, recreation areas, Section 4(f) sites, schools, television studios, trails, and trail crossings.  D  52  Interior  Auditoriums, day care centers, hospitals, libraries, medical facilities, places of worship, public meeting rooms, public or nonprofit institutional structures, radio studios, recording studios, schools, and television studios.  E  72  Exterior  Hotels, motels, offices, restaurants/bars, and other developed lands, properties, or activities not included in A through D or F.  F  —3    Agriculture, airports, bus Facilities, emergency services, industrial, logging, maintenance facilities, manufacturing, mining, rail facilities, retail facilities, ship facilities, utilities (water resources, water treatment, electrical), and warehousing.  G  —3    Undeveloped lands that are not permitted.  Notes: Leq(h) = 1-hour equivalent continuous sound level  1 The Leq(h) activity criteria values are for impact determination only and are not design standards for noise abatement measures. 2 Includes undeveloped lands permitted for this activity category. 3 FHWA has not established noise abatement criteria for Activity Categories F and G. Source: FHWA 23 CFR 772  In identifying noise impacts, primary consideration is given to exterior areas of frequent human use. In situations where there are no exterior activities, or where the exterior activities are far from the roadway or physically shielded in a manner that prevents an impact on exterior activities, the interior criterion (Activity Category D) is used as the basis for determining a noise impact.  TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY The elements of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) Lake Tahoe Regional Plan related to noise include the following: Noise Subelement of the Goals and Policies of the Regional Plan (TRPA 2012a); Code of Ordinances (Code), Chapter 68, Noise Limitations (TRPA 2012b); plan area statements (PASs), community plans, and area plans; and detailed modeling parameters (TRPA 2012c).  Lake Tahoe Regional Plan Goals and Policies The Noise Subelement of the Goals and Policies includes a goal to attain and maintain CNEL standards that are relevant to the project (Goal N-2) (TRPA 2012a:2-26 to 2-28). The underlying policies intended to help achieve that goal include: reducing noise from transportation corridors using a variety of approaches, including setbacks, earthen berms, and barriers (Policy N-2.1), and establishing CNEL values for certain transportation corridors (e.g., US 50 and SR 207 within the study area) (Policy N-2.3). The transportation corridor CNEL values override land use-based CNELs within 300 feet of the applicable roadway (TRPA 2012a:2-26). The full text of these goals and policies, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with the goals and policies, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.” Code of Ordinances Chapter 68, “Noise Limitations,” of the TRPA Code of Ordinances (Code) is intended to implement the Noise Subelement of the Goals and Policies and to attain and maintain the TRPA Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities (shown below) (TRPA 2012b:68-1 to 68-5). Section 68.4, “Community Noise Levels,” states that TRPA shall use CNELs to measure community noise levels and that PASs shall set forth CNELs that shall not be exceeded by any one activity or combination of activities (see PASs below). The CNELs set forth in the PASs are based on the land use classification, the presence of transportation corridors, and the applicable threshold standard. Exhibit 3.15-1 shows applicable PASs and Area Plans within the study area and the designated CNEL standards.  Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities TRPA has established environmental thresholds for nine resources, including noise. There are two noise threshold indicators: single noise events and cumulative noise events. The Lake Tahoe Basin’s status in 2015 was non-attainment for single noise events and for cumulative noise. However, TRPA’s 2015 Threshold Evaluation Report (TRPA 2016) indicates that the feasibility of meeting the currently adopted single and cumulative noise events standards (maximum allowable ambient noise levels) should be evaluated to ensure the standards are protective and realistically achievable. Single Noise Events A single noise event can be defined as an unexpected, short-term increase in acoustic level. Single Noise Event Threshold Standards adopted by TRPA are based on the numerical value associated with the maximum measured level in acoustical energy during an event. This threshold establishes maximum noise levels for aircraft, watercraft, motor vehicles, motorcycles, off-road vehicles, and snowmobiles.  Cumulative Noise Events TRPA adopted CNEL standards for different zones within the Region to account for expected levels of serenity. The standards, established in the Goals and Policies, apply to the entire Lake Tahoe Region. Table 3.15-4 summarizes thresholds for single events (Lmax) and thresholds for community noise events.  The noise limitations established in Chapter 68 of the TRPA Code, including the noise standards of individual PASs, community plans, and area plans, do not apply to noise from TRPA-approved construction or maintenance projects, or the demolition of structures, provided that such activities are limited to the hours between 8:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. Further, the noise limitations of Chapter 68 shall not apply to emergency work to protect life or property. As indicated in Note 4 of Table 3.15-4, TRPA’s transportation corridor noise threshold for US 50 overrides TRPA’s land use-based CNEL thresholds at all locations within 300 feet from the edge of the roadway.      Exhibit 3.15-1 Applicable CNEL Noise Standards   Table 3.15-4 TRPA Noise Thresholds1  Single Noise Events  Noise Measurement  Boats (not to exceed any of 3 tests)  82 dB measured at 50 feet with engine at 3,000 rpm  SAE test J1970 or SAEJ1970, Shoreline Test, 75 dB (standard adopted 7/03)  SAE Test J2005, Stationary Test, 88 dB if watercraft manufactured on or after 1/1/93 and 90 dB if watercraft manufactured before 1/1/93 (standard adopted 7/03)  Motor Vehicles (less than 6,000 pounds GVW)  76 dB running at <35/mph (82 dB running at >35/mph) measured at 50 feet  Motor Vehicles (greater than 6,000 pounds GVW)  82 dB running at <35/mph (86 dB running at >35/mph) measured at 50 feet  Motorcycles  77 dB running at <35/mph (86 dB running at >35/mph) measured at 50 feet  Off-road Vehicles  72 dB running at <35/mph (86 dB running at >35/mph) measured at 50 feet  Snowmobiles  82 dB running at <35/mph measured at 50 feet  [Land Use-Based] Community Noise Equivalent Levels: Background levels shall not exceed the following:2  Land Use Category  CNEL, dB  High Density Residential  55  Low Density Residential  50  Hotel/motel facilities  55  Commercial area  65  Industrial  65  Urban Outdoor Recreation  55  Rural Outdoor Recreation  50  Wilderness and Roadless Areas  45  Critical Wildlife Areas  45  Policy Statement: It shall be a policy of the TRPA Governing Board in the development of the Regional Plan to define, locate, and establish CNEL levels for transportation corridors.  Transportation [Corridor Noise Standards]3  US 50  654 dB CNEL  State Routes 89, 207, 28, 267 and 431  554 dB CNEL  South Lake Tahoe Airport  605 dB CNEL  Notes: CNEL = community noise equivalent level measurements are weighted average of sound level gathered throughout a 24–hour period; dB = decibels; dB = A-weighted decibels; mph = miles per hour; rpm = revolutions per minute 1 The title of this table used in the TRPA Code is “TRPA Regional Plan Cumulative Noise Levels.” 2 For this analysis, these standards are referred to as “land use-based CNEL thresholds.” 3 For this analysis, these CNEL standards are referred to as “transportation corridor noise thresholds.” 4 This transportation corridor noise threshold overrides the land use CNEL thresholds and is limited to an area within 300 feet from the edge of the road. 5 This threshold applies to those areas impacted by the approved flight paths. Source: TRPA Code of Ordinances, Chapter 68 (TRPA 2012b)   A critical distinction exists between two of the types of TRPA noise thresholds presented in Table 3.15-4: 1. TRPA’s CNEL thresholds for land use types, which are referred to in this EIR/EIS/EIS as land use-based noise thresholds; and  2. TRPA’s noise threshold for transportation noise corridors.  TRPA’s land use-based noise thresholds indicate maximum levels of noise exposure for specific types of land uses (e.g., High Density Residential, Low Density Residential, Hotel/Motel Facilities). TRPA’s transportation corridor noise standards, including its threshold for the US 50 transportation corridor, are referred to as contour-based noise threshold. TRPA’s transportation corridor noise standards indicate how loud traffic noise can be at a distance of 300 feet from the edge of the highway. The transportation corridor noise threshold for US 50 specifies that the 65 CNEL noise contour generated by traffic on US 50 shall not extend more than 300 feet from the highway’s edge. Note that that if the 65 CNEL of a segment of US 50 extends to 300 feet from the highway edge the traffic noise levels will be greater than 65 CNEL at locations closer to the highway (e.g., approximately 68-69.5 CNEL 150 feet from the highway and approximately 71-72 CNEL 75 feet from the highway, applying the standard attenuation rate for roadway noise) and this condition is considered to be in attainment of the noise threshold expressed for US 50 transportation corridor. Thus, the land use-based noise thresholds and contour-based transportation corridor noise thresholds established by TRPA are fundamentally different metrics.  This distinction was not made in the noise impact analysis for the Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement (RTP/SCS EIR/EIS) (TMPO and TRPA 2012). The traffic noise impact analysis in the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS was a program-level analysis appropriate at a regional scale that focused primarily on the degree in which the RTP/SCS would result in noticeable traffic noise increases (i.e., increases of 3 dB or greater). The traffic noise levels presented in the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS are considered coarse estimates, because they did not take into account the noise-attenuating effects of topography or the presence of nearby stands of forest or man-made structures. As shown in Appendix E to the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS, traffic noise levels were estimated using spreadsheet calculations and the highway transportation corridors in the entire Tahoe Region were broken down into 24 highway segments. The summary of traffic noise level estimates presented in the program-level analysis of the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS were at a distance of 100 feet from the centerline of each highway segment (TMPO and TRPA 2012:3.6-22). In comparison, the more precise FHWA Traffic Noise Model, Version 2.5 was used to provide refined estimates of traffic noise levels at 167 different discrete receptors, taking into account the effects of nearby features (FHWA 2004, as cited in Caltrans 2015b).  The 2017 Regional Transportation Plan (2017 RTP), which is an update to the 2012 RTP, and its joint CEQA/TRPA environmental document have been circulated for public review. The projects listed in the 2017 RTP are substantially similar to those in the 2012 RTP, and the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project is included in both documents. TRPA and TMPO have prepared a joint CEQA Initial Study/TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist (IS/IEC) for the 2017 plan as a supplement to the 2012 RTP EIS/EIR, that relies largely on that document’s analysis of potential environmental impacts and mitigation measures. Because the IS/IEC has been prepared for the 2017 RTP as a supplement to the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS and does not result in new significant environmental impacts, the analysis herein continues to rely on the EIR/EIS. The distinction between TRPA’s land use-based noise thresholds and TRPA’s contour-based transportation corridor noise thresholds is emphasized in this EIR/EIS/EIS. This distinction has already been applied in the Placer County Tahoe Basin Area Plan and Tahoe City Lodge EIR/EIS (Placer County and TRPA 2016:13-15 to 13-16, 13-19 to 13-22) and is discussed further under the “Methods and Assumptions” section below.  Best Construction Practices Policy for the Minimization of Exposure to Construction-Generated Noise and Ground Vibration TRPA requires the following standard conditions for all project construction activity that involves grading; these conditions also apply to the construction of residential projects (TRPA [no date]a:6; TRPA [no date]b:4 to 5).   Any normal construction activities creating noise in excess of the TRPA noise standards shall be considered exempt from said standards provided all such work is conducted between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m.  Engine doors shall remain closed during periods of operation except during necessary engine maintenance.  Stationary equipment (e.g. generators or pumps) shall be located as far as feasible from noise-sensitive receptors and residential areas. Stationary equipment near sensitive noise receptors or residential areas shall be equipped with temporary sound barriers.  Sonic pile driving shall be utilized instead of impact pile driving, wherever feasible. Pile driving holes shall be predrilled to the extent feasible subject to design engineer’s approval. Plan Area Statements, Area Plans, and Community Plans The study area includes lands addressed in the following documents:   South Shore Area Plan (Douglas County and TRPA 2013:24)  Tourist Core Area Plan (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2013:C-13)  Stateline/Ski Run Community Plan (PAS 089B) (TRPA 1994)  PAS 080 Kingsbury Drainage (TRPA 2002a)  PAS 089 Lakeside Park (TRPA 2014)  PAS 090 Tahoe Meadows (TRPA 2002b)  PAS 092 Pioneer/Ski Run (TRPA 2002c) Exhibit 3.15-1 shows the CNEL standards that have been established by these local plans.  South Shore Area Plan The South Shore Area Plan, the boundaries of which are demarcated in Exhibit 3.15-1, reiterates the CNEL standards in Chapter 68 of the TRPA Code. In addition, the South Shore Area Plan designates a transportation noise corridor standard of 65 CNEL for the portions of Lake Parkway in Nevada that is limited to 300 feet from the edge of the right-of-way (Douglas County and TRPA 2013:24 [of the Douglas County Development Code, Title 20, Chapter 20.703]).  Tourist Core Area Plan The Tourist Core Area Plan, the boundaries of which are also shown in Exhibit 3.15-1, includes land use-based CNEL standards of 55 CNEL for areas designated for Recreation, Open Space, and the Shorezone portion of Tourist Center Gateway; and 65 CNEL for areas designated as Tourist Center Core, Tourist Center Mixed-Use, Tourist Center Mixed-Use Corridor, and the non-Shorezone portion of Tourist Center Gateway (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2013:C-13). The Tourist Core Area Plan also mentions the 65 CNEL transportation corridor noise standard for US 50, which extends to 300 feet from the edge of the roadway.  Policies LU-7.1 and LU-7.2 of the Tourist Core Area Plan also reiterate the noise standards of the City of South Lake General Plan that are shown in Table 3.15-5 (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2013:5-3 to 5-4).  Local Plan Area Statements and Community Plans A noise standard of 55 CNEL is established for areas in PAS 089 Lakeside Park, PAS 090 Tahoe Meadows, and within PAS 092 Pioneer/Ski Run (TRPA 2014:4; TRPA 2002b:3; TRPA 2002c:3). A noise standard of 50 CNEL is established for areas in PAS 080 Kingsbury Drainage that are not within 300 feet of the edge of US 50 or SR 207 (TRPA 2002a:4). Almost all of the area that was included in the Stateline/Ski Run Community Plan (PAS 089B) became part of the Tourist Core Area Plan and is now subject to the noise standards of that plan. However, a single California Tahoe Conservancy-owned parcel between the Forest Suites Resort and the Harrah’s resort-casino parking lot is part of the Stateline/Ski Run Community Plan (PAS 089B), including portions of Special Areas 1B and 2A; these areas are subject to a noise standard of 65 CNEL (TRPA 1994:II-3, II-39). STATE California California Environmental Quality Act The CEQA involves an analysis of baseline versus build conditions to assess whether a project would have a noise impact. If a project is determined to have a significant noise impact under CEQA, then mitigation measures must be incorporated into the project to the extent feasible to reduce the noise impact. The rest of this section includes NEPA 23 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 772 noise analysis and noise analysis under CEQA and evaluation of compliance with TRPA noise requirements. California State Building Code Title 24 The State of California’s noise insulation standards are codified in the California Code of Regulations, Title 24, Building Standards Administrative Code, Part 2, California Building Code. Title 24 is applied to new construction in California and states that interior noise levels attributable to exterior sources shall not exceed 45 dB in any habitable room. An acoustical analysis documenting compliance with the interior sound level standards shall be prepared for structures containing habitable rooms within the CNEL noise contours of 60-dB or greater.  California Department of Transportation Standard Specification 14-8.02 Caltrans Standard Specification 14-8.02, Noise Control, states that noise levels from construction activity between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. shall not exceed 86 dB Lmax at a distance of 50 feet from the construction site (Caltrans 2015a:215).  California Department of Transportation Traffic Noise Analysis Protocol Caltrans published the Traffic Noise Analysis Protocol for New Highway Construction and Reconstruction Projects (Caltrans 2011). The protocol specifies the policies, procedures, and practices to be used by agencies that sponsor new construction or reconstruction of federal or federal-aid highway projects. The NAC specified in the protocol are the same as those specified in 23 CFR 772. The protocol defines a noise increase as substantial if the predicted noise level with project implementation in the design year would exceed the existing noise level by 12 dB. The protocol also states that a sound level is considered to approach an NAC level when the predicted sound level in the design year would be within 1 dB of the NAC identified in 23 CFR 772 (e.g., 66 dB is considered to approach the NAC of 67 dB, but 65 dB is not). If it is determined that the project would have noise impacts, then potential noise abatement measures must be considered. Noise abatement measures that are determined to be reasonable and feasible at the time of final design are incorporated into the project plans and specifications. This document discusses noise abatement measures that would likely be incorporated in the project. Caltrans Traffic Noise Analysis Protocol sets forth the criteria for determining when a noise abatement measure is reasonable and feasible. Feasibility of noise abatement is basically an engineering concern. A minimum 7 dB reduction (for projects using the 2011 Noise Protocol) in the future noise level must be achieved for a noise abatement measure to be considered feasible. Other considerations include topography, access requirements, other noise sources, and safety considerations. The reasonableness determination is basically a cost-benefit analysis. Factors used in determining whether a proposed noise abatement measure is reasonable include: residents’ acceptance and the cost per benefited residence. Nevada Nevada Department of Transportation The Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) Traffic and Construction Noise Analysis and Abatement Policy defines how NDOT applies FHWA’s Highway Traffic Noise Regulation contained in 23 CFR 772 and the FHWA Highway Traffic Noise: Analysis and Abatement Guidance (FHWA 2011). The NAC specified in the NDOT policy are the same as those specified in 23 CFR 772. NDOT’s policy defines a noise increase as substantial when the predicted noise levels in the design year with project implementation would exceed existing noise levels by 15 dB. The policy also states that a sound level is considered to approach an NAC level when the sound level is 1 dB less than the NAC identified in 23 CFR 772.  LOCAL Douglas County The Environmental Resources and Conservation Element of the 2011 Douglas County Master Plan refers to the noise standards established in the Douglas County Code (Douglas County 2011:6); the following standards apply to the project:  20.702.180 Noise Standards.  Exterior noise levels must comply with the provisions in the PASs, Community Plans, or Sub-section N of Section 20.690.030, whichever is most restrictive.   Interior noise levels must comply with the provisions in sub-section N of section 20.690.030.  20.690.030 Section L, Hours of Construction.  The hours of operation for all building construction activities not within a dedicated road right-of-way are as follows: 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Monday through Friday; 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.  20.690.030 Section N, Noise. The following provisions shall apply: 1.  No exterior noise level shall exceed 65 dB CNEL exterior and 45 dB CNEL interior in residential areas. 2.  All residential developments shall incorporate the following standards to mitigate noise levels: a.  Increase the distance between the noise source and receiver; b.  Locate land uses not sensitive to noise, which include but are not limited to parking lots, garages, maintenance facilities, and utility areas, between the noise source and the receiver; 3.  The minimum acceptable surface weight for a noise barrier is four pounds per square foot (equivalent to ¾-inch plywood). The barrier shall be of a continuous material which is resistant to sound including: a.  Masonry block; b.  Pre-cast concrete; c.  Earth berm or a combination of earth berm with block concrete. 4.  Noise barriers shall interrupt the line-of-sight between noise source and receiver.  20.690.030 Section X, Vibration.  No vibration associated with any use shall be permitted which is discernible beyond the boundary line of the property. City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan The Health and Safety Element of the City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan contains the following goals and policies applicable to the project (City of South Lake Tahoe 2011:HS-9 to HS-13):  Policy HS‐8.4: Annoying and Excessive Transportation Noise Protection. The City shall not allow noise‐sensitive land uses in areas exposed to existing or projected transportation noise levels that exceed the standards shown in Table HS‐2 [Table 3.15-5 in this document], unless the project design includes effective mitigation measures to reduce exterior noise and noise levels in interior spaces to the levels at or below those shown in Table HS‐2 [Table 3.15-5 in this document]. [Note that the noise standards from the General Plan also apply to the portion of the city within the Tourist Core Area Plan, as stated in Policy LU-7.1 and Policy LU-7.2 of the Tourist Core Area Plan (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2013:5-3 to 5-4). Thus, land in the Tourist Core Area Plan is subject to both the city’s noise standards shown in Table 3.15-5 and the land use-based CNEL standards of the Tourist Core Area Plan]. Table 3.15-5 Maximum Allowable Noise Exposure from Transportation Noise Sources in the City of South Lake Tahoe  Land Use  Outdoor Activity Areas1 Ldn/CNEL, dB  Interior Spaces  Roadways  Railroads/Aircraft  Ldn/CNEL, dB  Leq, dB2  Residential  603  655  45    Transient Lodging  654,5  654,5  45    Hospitals, Nursing Homes  603  603  45    Theaters, Auditoriums, Music Halls        35  Churches, Meeting Halls  603  655    40  Office Buildings        45  Schools, Libraries, Museums        45  Playgrounds, Neighborhood Parks  70  75      1 Where the location of outdoor activity areas is unknown, the exterior noise level standard shall be applied to the property line of the receiving land use.

The City shall require the mitigation of new transportation noise sources to the levels shown in Table HS‐2 [Table 3.15-5 in this document] at all outdoor activity areas and interior spaces of existing noise‐sensitive land uses.  Policy HS‐8.6: Acoustical Analysis Preparation. The City shall require an acoustical analysis as part of the environmental review process when noise‐sensitive land uses are proposed in areas exposed to existing or projected exterior noise levels exceeding the levels shown in Table HS‐1 [non-transportation noise standards are not included in this environmental review document] and Table HS‐2 [Table 3.15-5 in this document], so noise mitigation may be included in the project design. All acoustical analysis shall: A.  Be the financial responsibility of the applicant; B.  Be prepared by a qualified person experienced in the fields of environmental noise assessment and architectural acoustics; C.  Include representative noise level measurements with sufficient sampling periods and locations to adequately describe local conditions and the predominant noise sources; and D.  Estimate existing and projected cumulative (20 year) noise levels in terms of Ldn or CNEL and/or the standards shown in Table HS‐1 [non-transportation noise standards, not included in this document], and compare those levels to the policies in this section; E.  Recommend appropriate mitigation to achieve compliance with the adopted policies and standards in this section, giving preference to proper site planning and design over mitigation measures which require the construction of noise barriers or structural modifications to buildings which contain noise‐sensitive land uses;  F.  Estimate noise exposure after the prescribed mitigation measure(s) has been implemented; and G.  Describe a post‐project assessment program that could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation measures. South Lake Tahoe City Code Sections 5 through 8 of the City Code refer to TRPA’s noise ordinance. The TRPA Code Section 68.9 states that the noise standards in Chapter 68 (in the TRPA Code) will not apply to TRPA-approved construction or maintenance projects, or the demolition of structures, provided such activities are limited to the hours between 8:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. Activities conducted outside of these hours are subject to the noise standards set forth by PASs, community plans, and area plans (Caltrans 2015b:22 and 23). El Dorado County  Small areas of unincorporated El Dorado County could be affected by changes in traffic noise levels with some action alternatives, such as parts of Van Sickle Bi-State Park near Lake Parkway. Although El Dorado County does not have authority over state lands, El Dorado County’s policies and standards are relevant to the impact analysis.  The most recent noise standards for El Dorado County are stated in Chapter 130.37 of the zoning ordinance, which was adopted by the county on December 15, 2015. The zoning ordinance includes noise standards for outdoor activity areas of different types of land uses. The transportation noise standard established by the county that is most applicable to the unincorporated areas of the county that lie within the state park is 70 CNEL, which has been designated for playgrounds and neighborhood parks (El Dorado County 2015:71). Section 130.37.20 of the zoning ordinance exempts construction noise from all of the county’s standards during daylight hours provided that all construction equipment is fitted with factory-installed muffling devices and maintained in good working order.  3.15.2 Affected Environment Noise is produced from various sources throughout the study area, but vehicle traffic on US 50 and local roadways is generally considered the dominant noise source. Other noise sources include aircraft, motorized watercraft, music from summer concerts, and machinery associated with refuse collection and snow removal. Less pronounced noise sources in the study area include those typical of urban and suburban environments, such as landscaping activities (e.g., grass cutting, leaf blowing, snow blowing), heating and air conditioning units, and conversation. Traffic on US 50 and local roadways is the predominant noise source in the study area. The extent to which existing land uses in the study area are affected by existing traffic noise depends on their proximity to the roadways and sensitivity to noise. Table 3.15-6 shows the modeled distance of the 65 CNEL traffic noise contour from the edge of various segments of US 50 that pass through the study area for existing conditions, as well as the segments of Lake Parkway on the Nevada side. These values were obtained from the traffic noise analysis prepared for the project (Caltrans 2015b:167). Existing traffic noise contours were modeled in accordance with the FHWA Traffic Noise Model, Version 2.5 (FHWA 2004). The traffic noise modeling results presented in Table 3.15-6 are based on existing traffic volumes and speeds obtained from the Traffic Operations Analysis Update, US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project (Wood Rodgers 2013). Key inputs to the traffic noise model were the locations of roadways, shielding features (e.g., topography and buildings), noise barriers, ground type, and receptors. Three-dimensional representations of these inputs were developed using Computer-Aided Design drawings, aerials, and topographic contours provided by Wood Rodgers (Caltrans2015b:40). Twenty-eight sound level measurements were conducted in the study area, 19 of which were used to calibrate the traffic noise model with concurrent traffic volume counts; the other nine sound level measurements were not used for model calibration because traffic was not the predominant noise source at their locations (Caltrans2015b:vi). Four long-term measurement sites were recorded to capture the diurnal traffic noise level pattern in the study area (Caltrans 2015b:31, 39).  As shown in Table 3.15-6, the existing 65 CNEL contour along US 50 and Lake Parkway does not extend more than 300 feet from the roadway’s edge. Thus, noise levels generated by traffic on US 50 and Lake Parkway in the study area are in attainment of TRPA’s 65 CNEL contour threshold for US 50 and the portions of Lake Parkway in Nevada.  Table 3.15-6 Modeled Existing 65 CNEL Contours along Major Transportation Corridors within the Study Area  Major Transportation Corridor Segment  Distance to 65 CNEL Contour from Roadway Edge (ft)  US 50 South of Pioneer Trail  61  US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Park Avenue  62  US 50 between Park Avenue and Friday Avenue  58  US 50 between Friday Avenue and Stateline Avenue  56  US 50 North of Stateline Avenue  50  US 50 South of Loop Road/Lake Parkway  52  US 50 North of Loop Road/Lake Parkway  71  Lake Parkway between Park Avenue and Harrah’s Road  <62  Lake Parkway between Harrah’s Road and US 50  <62  Lake Parkway West of US 50  <68  Lake Parkway North of Stateline Avenue  <68  Notes: CNEL = community noise equivalent level, expressed in A-weighted decibels; ft = feet Refer to Appendix K for detailed traffic noise modeling input data and output results. Source: Caltrans 2015b:167  Table 3.15-7 summarizes the modeled existing traffic noise levels of local roadways in the study area. Table 3.15-7 shows the CNEL at a distance of 50 feet from the centerline of the near travel lane of each local roadway. These traffic noise levels were obtained from a traffic noise analysis prepared for the project (Caltrans 2015b:167), which also used traffic volumes and speeds from the traffic analysis prepared for the project (Wood Rodgers 2013). Short-term noise monitoring data was collected at the following times on several different days (Caltrans 2015b:47):   between 7:25 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. on August 25, 2011;   between 8:30 a.m. and 6:40 p.m. on July 14, 2014;  between approximately 10:00 a.m. and 3:45 p.m. on July 15, 2014;  at 9:10 a.m. on July 16, 2014; and   between approximately 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. on September 9, 2014. Table 3.15-7 Modeled Existing Traffic Noise Levels along Local Roadways  Local Roadway Segment  CNEL (dB) at 50 feet from the Centerline of the Closest Travel Lane  Pioneer Trail South of US 50  60.6  Park Avenue East of Pine Boulevard  58.0  Park Avenue West of US 50  59.0  Heavenly Village Way East of US 50  57.0  Heavenly Village Way West of Lake Parkway  56.4  Stateline Avenue West of Pine Boulevard  51.7  Stateline Avenue East of Pine Boulevard  52.7  Stateline Avenue West of US 50  57.2  Pine Boulevard South of Stateline Avenue  56.6  Pine Boulevard North of Park Avenue  56.9  Lake Parkway between Park Avenue and Harrah’s Road1  60.1  Lake Parkway North of Stateline Avenue1  60.2  Notes: CNEL = community noise equivalent level; dB = A-weighted decibel 1 The segments of Lake Parkway between Park Avenue in the table are located on the California side and therefore not subject to the 65 CNEL transportation corridor standard of the South Shore Area Plan. Refer to Appendix K for detailed traffic noise modeling input data and output results. Source: Caltrans 2015b:167  3.15.3 Environmental Consequences  METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS Construction-Related Noise and Vibration The potential for construction activities to expose receptors to excessive noise levels was assessed based on the types of construction equipment that would be used, the noise levels typically generated by these types of equipment, the proximity of construction activity to existing receptors, and whether construction noise would be generated during noise-sensitive evening and nighttime hours. Referenced noise levels for typical construction equipment are from the FHWA’s Roadway Construction Noise Model (FHWA 2006).  The potential for construction activities to expose receptors to excessive levels of noise or ground vibration was assessed based on the types of construction activity that would be performed, the levels of ground vibration they would produce, and the proximity of construction activity to existing nearby structures.  The analysis of exposure to construction-generated noise and vibration also considers the requirements of TRPA’s Best Construction Practices Policy for the Minimization of Exposure to Construction-Generated Noise and Ground Vibration.  Traffic Noise Increases at Existing Receptors Changes in traffic noise levels throughout the study area with each of the alternatives were modeled and presented in the Noise Study Report (Caltrans 2015b). Traffic noise modeling was conducted for all affected roadway segments using the FHWA Traffic Noise Model Version 2.5 (TNM2.5, FHWA 2006). This modeling estimated the traffic noise level at 167 different discrete modeling receptor sites (the locations of which are displayed in Figure 3 of the Noise Study Report incorporated by reference here; Caltrans 2015b:33). The discrete modeling receptor sites are often referred to as “receptors” in this EIR/EIS/EIS; however, a single discrete modeling receptor site may be representative of multiple other nearby receptors (e.g., surrounding homes) that are equidistant or closer to the nearby source of roadway noise. Thus, this EIR/EIS/EIS recognizes that an exceedance of an applicable noise standard at a single modeled receptor site may indicate exposure that would be experienced by land uses equidistant or closer to the highway in that area. The traffic noise modeling was based on data from a project-specific traffic analysis prepared in 2013 (Wood Rodgers 2013). The traffic analysis has been revised since the Noise Study Report was prepared using the most recent set of traffic counts collected in the study area. The revised traffic analysis is presented in a Traffic Operations Analysis Update dated February 2016 (Wood Rodgers 2016) and discussed in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation.” A comparison of the two sets of traffic volume estimates indicates that the traffic volume estimates used in the traffic noise modeling (i.e., from the earlier data set) are substantially higher than the updated estimates, particularly for the higher-volume roadway segments that are the predominant noise sources in the study area. Therefore, the traffic noise level estimates from the Noise Study Report may be somewhat overstated. The word “somewhat” is used here because of the logarithmic nature of adding and subtracting sound pressure levels when expressed in decibels. With the decibel scale, a halving of sound energy—such as a halving of a traffic volume—corresponds to a 3-dB decrease. Nonetheless, the traffic noise estimates used to conduct this impact analysis are conservative. Moreover, the traffic volumes used in the traffic noise modeling presented in the Noise Study Report (i.e., from the older traffic study) are also higher than the more accurate, revised traffic volumes even with the addition of trips associated with the three mixed-use development sites. Thus, the traffic noise estimates provided in the Noise Study Report are conservative enough (i.e., tending to somewhat overstate levels) such that they also adequately account for the noise generation from traffic related to development of the three mixed-use development sites.  The traffic noise modeling presented in the Noise Study Report is also based on short- and long-term noise measurements, the reference noise emission levels for automobiles, medium trucks, and heavy trucks, with consideration given to vehicle volume, speed, roadway configuration, distance to the receiver, and ground attenuation factors. Truck usage and vehicle speeds on roadways in the study area were estimated from field observations and data developed in support of the preliminary traffic analysis (see Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation”). Another reason the noise modeling represents a conservative noise evaluation (i.e., tending to somewhat overstate impacts) is because it does not account for the potential noise attenuating character of any natural or human-made shielding (e.g., the presence of vegetation, berms, walls, or buildings). Thus, for those receptors located in heavily forested areas of Van Sickle Bi-State Park, adjustments were made to the modeled noise levels to account for the additional attenuation provided by stands of trees based on applicable guidance (Hoover & Keith Inc. 2000:6-9, as cited in Caltrans 2013a:7-8). Modeling and calculations in Appendix K presents results for both 2018 and 2038, which are representative of analysis years 2020 and 2040, the years evaluated in the Traffic Operations Analysis Update. For complete details on model inputs, outputs, and assumptions see the Noise Study Report conducted for the project alternatives incorporated here by reference (Caltrans 2015b). To evaluate impacts, noise and vibration effects were determined based on comparisons to applicable regulations, including FHWA and Caltrans criteria, TRPA thresholds, TRPA significance criteria, and the noise standards of local jurisdictions.  Because TRPA’s traffic noise threshold for US 50 overrides the land use-based CNEL thresholds at all locations within 300 feet of the highway’s edge, as shown in Table 3.15-4, analysis was conducted to determine whether the 65 CNEL noise contour of US 50 would extend more than 300 feet beyond the highway’s edge, which would indicate exceedance of the threshold. The same analysis was conducted for the segments of Lake Parkway in Nevada because these roadway segments also have a contour-based traffic noise threshold override, which was established by the South Shore Area Plan. The traffic noise contour-based analysis for both of these transportation corridors addresses whether the noise level at land uses located within 300 feet of these roadway segments are compliant with TRPA’s noise thresholds for these transportation corridors.  For those land uses located more than 300 feet from the edge of US 50 or the segments of Lake Parkway in Nevada, including noise-sensitive receptors (e.g., residences), a separate analysis was conducted to determine whether these receptors would be exposed to noise levels that exceed the applicable TRPA land use-based CNEL threshold.  This analysis also recognizes that the realignment of US 50 with Alternatives B, C, and D would change which type of TRPA noise threshold, either the land use-based CNEL threshold or the transportation overlay CNEL threshold, would apply at a particular location. The transportation corridor overlay 65 CNEL threshold would move with any realignment of the US 50 transportation corridor to the proposed alignment. This means that the type of TRPA noise threshold (i.e., transportation corridor-contour-based or land use-based) and the applicable CNEL noise threshold level applicable at a discrete receptor location could change with Alternatives B, C, and D, if the distance between the realigned US 50 highway edge and the receptor is modified to be 300 feet or closer).  Noise-Land Use Compatibility of the Mixed-Use Development Sites For the mixed-use development sites in the City of South Lake Tahoe with Alternatives B, C, and D, the analysis examines whether the replacement housing and residential land uses included at these redevelopment sites would be exposed to noise levels that exceed applicable TRPA thresholds and/or traffic noise standards established by the City of South Lake Tahoe. This analysis is based on the traffic noise contour distances reported in Tables D-10, D-11, and D-12 of the Noise Study Report (Caltrans 2015b).  SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA Significance criteria relevant to noise and vibration are summarized below. All significance criteria regard exterior noise levels unless otherwise noted.  NEPA Criteria An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the locally preferred action. Under NEPA, the significance of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. In accordance with FHWA, Caltrans, and NDOT criteria for traffic noise impacts, a project would cause a substantial increase in noise if:   construction generated a noise level greater than 86 dB Lmax at a distance of 50 feet from the construction site between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.;  the traffic noise levels at sensitive receptor locations during the design year (i.e., 2040) is predicted to approach or exceed the NAC for the corresponding activity category (as listed in Table 3.15-3). A sound level is considered to approach an NAC level if the sound level is 1 dB less than the NAC. For the purposes of this project the following significance criteria are applicable to the proposed project:   66 dB at residential land uses (i.e., the level approaching the NAC for Activity Category B),   66 dB at campgrounds, picnic areas, parks, or recreational areas (i.e., the level approaching the NAC for Activity Category C), or   72 dB at hotels, motels, or other tourist accommodation units (i.e., the level approaching the NAC for Activity Category E); or  the predicted worst-hour traffic noise level (Leq[h]) would increase by 12 dB or more at a noise-sensitive receptor in California or by 15 dB at a noise-sensitive receptor in Nevada compared to the corresponding modeled existing worst-hour noise level.  TRPA Criteria The noise and vibration criteria from the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist were used to evaluate the noise and vibration impacts of the alternatives. In accordance with TRPA’s checklist, a project would cause a significant effect if it would:  increase existing CNELs beyond those permitted in the applicable Plan Area Statement, Community Plan or Master Plan (i.e., noise generated by construction or demolition activity that would exceed applicable TRPA noise standards outside of the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., for which construction noise is exempt from TRPA standards by Chapter 68 of the TRPA Code); or if traffic noise levels would exceed the applicable TRPA noise threshold standards, expressed in CNEL, including the land use-based TRPA Regional Plan Cumulative Noise Level thresholds shown in Table 3.15-4 or the transportation corridor noise thresholds in that same table);  expose people to severe noise level increases (i.e., a long-term noise level increase of 3 dB or greater at a noise-sensitive receptor such as a residence, hotel, or tourist accommodation unit);   expose existing structures to levels of ground vibration that could result in structural damage (i.e., exceedance of Caltrans’s recommended level of 0.2 in/sec PPV with respect to the prevention of structural damage for normal buildings or FTA’s maximum acceptable level of 80 VdB with respect to human response for residential uses [i.e., annoyance] at nearby existing vibration-sensitive land uses, including residences, hotels, and tourist accommodation units);  place residential or tourist accommodation uses in areas where the existing CNEL exceeds 60 dB or is otherwise incompatible; or  place uses that would generate an incompatible noise level in close proximity to existing residential or tourist accommodation uses.  CEQA Criteria In accordance with Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines, a project would cause a significant noise or vibration impact if it would:  cause a substantial temporary (or periodic) increase in ambient noise levels in the project vicinity above levels existing without the project (i.e., construction noise levels that impact noise-sensitive receptors in the City of South Lake Tahoe outside the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., as established in Section 5-8 of the City of South Lake Tahoe Code; or construction noise levels that impact noise-sensitive receptors in El Dorado County during non-daylight hours, for which construction noise is not exempt from the County’s noise standards by Section 130.37.20 of the El Dorado County zoning ordinance);   expose persons to or generation of excessive ground vibration or ground noise levels (i.e., exceed Caltrans’s recommended level of 0.2 in/sec PPV with respect to the prevention of structural damage for normal buildings or FTA’s maximum acceptable level of 80 VdB with respect to human response for residential uses [i.e., annoyance] at nearby existing vibration-sensitive land uses, including residences, hotels, and tourist accommodation units);   expose persons to or generation of noise levels in excess of standards established in the local general plan or noise ordinance, or applicable standards of other agencies (i.e., exceed the maximum allowable noise exposure levels from transportation noise sources established by the City of South Lake Tahoe, as shown in Table 3.15-5, or the CNEL standards established in the El Dorado County zoning ordinance); or   cause a substantial permanent increase in ambient noise levels in the project vicinity above levels existing without the project (i.e., a long-term noise level increase of 3 dB or greater at a noise-sensitive receptor). ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF THE PROJECT ALTERNATIVES Impact 3.15-1: Short-term construction noise levels Alternative A would not include any noise-generating construction or demolition activity. Construction and demolition activity that would occur with the Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements and replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites would take place during the less noise-sensitive time of day and comply with the requirements of TRPA’s Best Construction Practices Policy for the Minimization of Exposure to Construction-Generated Noise and Ground Vibration. Alternative E would include construction activity during noise-sensitive evening nighttime hours that could result in exceedances of applicable TRPA land use-based noise thresholds at noise sensitive receptors, as well as exceedances of interior noise standards at nearby hotels and residences.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, and D would avoid or minimize the impacts related to short-term construction noise such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; Mitigation Measure 3.15-1 has been incorporated into Alternative E to further reduce to the extent feasible adverse construction-related noise; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less than Significant for Alternatives B, C, and D; Significant and Unavoidable for Alternative E after implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.15-1; No Impact for Alternative A Alternative A: No Build (No Project) With Alternative A there would be no improvements to existing US 50, Lake Parkway, or other roadways; and no existing housing units or other buildings would undergo demolition within the project site boundaries. Therefore, there would be no impact pertaining to the exposure of noise-sensitive receptors to excessive noise levels generated by construction equipment with Alternative A for purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Alternative B would include the demolition of buildings that would be acquired for the right of way of New US 50; construction of realigned US 50 from just west of the Pioneer Trail in California to Lake Parkway in Nevada; corridor improvements and enhanced bicycle, transit, and pedestrian facilities as part of the conversion of the existing US 50 to a local or main street; multiple intersection improvements including construction of a roundabout at US 50/Lake Parkway; construction of a new pedestrian bridge over realigned US 50 and a new shared-use path to provide a connection between the tourist core and Van Sickle Bi-State Park; and realignment of utility lines and stormwater drainage improvements.  Construction activity would be expected to include standard equipment used in roadway and highway construction such as haul trucks and mixers, excavators, compactors, dozers, loaders, pavers, scrapers, and graders. Demolition activities associated with Alternative B would likely include use of cranes, excavators, bulldozers, and haul trucks to off-haul demolition material. Pile drivers may be used during construction of the pedestrian bridge over the realigned US 50 alignment. No blasting would be performed as part of construction or demolition activities. Table 3.15‐8 shows the maximum noise levels generated by the types of equipment and activities that are anticipated to be used for construction and demolition activities.  Table 3.15-8 Typical Construction Equipment Noise Levels  Type of Equipment  Noise Level (dB Lmax) at 50 feet  Impact Pile Driver  101  Vibratory Pile Driver  101  Crane  85  Excavator  85  Dozer  85  Grader  85  Paver  85  Scraper  85  Concrete Mixer Truck  85  Dump Truck  84  Concrete Pump Truck  82  Generator  82  Backhoe  80  Compactor  80  Front End Loader  80  Notes: dB = decibels; Lmax = maximum noise level Source: FHWA 2006:3  As shown in Table 3.15‐8, pile driving would generate the highest noise levels, emitting up to 101 dB Lmax at a distance of 50 feet. Pile driving may be required during construction of the pedestrian bridge across realigned US 50, depending on final design of the footings. In addition to being loud, pile driving can be annoying due to the pulsating nature of the sound it produces. The loudest types of equipment that would be used at other locations do not produce a pulsating noise and generate noise levels as high as 85 dB Lmax at a distance of 50 feet. Due to the linear nature of the project and the relatively short duration of construction activity in any one place, no single receptor location would be exposed to construction-related noise for an excessive period of time. As stated in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives,” construction activities related to Alternatives B would occur between 8:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m.; it is not anticipated that any construction activities would be required outside of these hours without specific noise-reduction requirements imposed by TRPA, the City of South Lake Tahoe and/or Douglas County, Caltrans, and NDOT. This is consistent with TRPA’s Best Construction Practices Policy for the Minimization of Exposure to Construction-Generated Noise and Ground Vibration (TRPA [no date]a:6; TRPA [no date]b:4 to 5); the City of South Lake Tahoe City Code (Caltrans2015b:22 and 23); and part 20.690.030 of the Environmental Resources and Conservation Element of the 2011 Douglas County Master Plan (Douglas County 2011:6). It would also be consistent with the requirements of Caltrans’s Standard Specification 14-8.02, which requires that construction noise levels not exceed 86 dB at a distance of 50 feet between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. (Caltrans 2015a:215). All construction activity would be required to comply with other requirements of TRPA’s Best Construction Practices Policy for the Minimization of Exposure to Construction-Generated Noise and Ground Vibration, including locating stationary equipment (such as generators or pumps) as far as feasible from noise-sensitive receptors and residential areas, equipping stationary equipment near sensitive noise receptors or residential areas with temporary sound barriers, and using sonic pile driving instead of impact pile driving, wherever feasible. Construction noise would not be generated during the more noise‐sensitive times of the day (i.e., outside the hours exempt by TRPA and the local jurisdiction) unless a site‐specific analysis determines that the resultant noise levels would not exceed applicable standards or require specific noise reduction measures. For these reasons, construction-generated noise associated with the Alternative B transportation improvements would be less than significant for purposes of TRPA and CEQA. For the purposes of NEPA, design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize short-term construction noise such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative B includes the option to redevelop three multi-use development sites, which could provide replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Redevelopment of these sites would involve the full and partial acquisition of additional parcels. Thus, demolition and construction activity would occur on the redevelopment sites in addition to the construction activities that would occur without mixed use development. Because all construction activity would be required to comply with the requirements of TRPA’s Best Construction Practices Policy for the Minimization of Exposure to Construction-Generated Noise and Ground Vibration, including the requirement to only take place during less-sensitive times of day, and be temporary in nature, construction-generated noise would be less than significant for purposes of TRPA and CEQA. For the purposes of NEPA, design features of the mixed-use development sites, including replacement housing, included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize short-term construction noise such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential short-term construction noise impacts as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of short-term construction noise impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact related to short-term construction noise. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would minimize short-term construction noise such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Alternative C would involve demolition and construction activity in the same locations as Alternative B and involve the same types of noise-generating construction equipment listed in Table 3.15‐8.  Similar to Alternative B, construction activities for Alternative C would occur between 8:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. and it is not anticipated that any construction activities would be required outside of these hours without specific noise-reduction requirements imposed by TRPA, the City of South Lake Tahoe and/or Douglas County, Caltrans, and NDOT. Also similar to Alternative B, no single receptor would be exposed to construction-related noise for an excessive period of time due to the linear nature of the project; all construction activity would occur during less noise-sensitive times of day pursuant to the requirements of TRPA, local jurisdictions, and Caltrans; and all construction activity would be required to comply with TRPA’s Best Construction Practices Policy for the Minimization of Exposure to Construction-Generated Noise and Ground Vibration. Therefore, the impact of construction-generated noise associated with the Alternative C transportation improvements would be less than significant for purposes of TRPA and CEQA. For the purposes of NEPA, design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize short-term construction noise such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative C would include the option to demolish additional existing buildings and construct new mixed-use land uses on the same redevelopment sites as Alternative B. Redevelopment of these sites would involve the full and partial acquisition of additional parcels. Thus, demolition and construction activity would occur on the redevelopment sites in addition to all the construction activities that would occur without the mixed-use development. Because all construction activity would be required to comply with the requirements of TRPA’s Best Construction Practices Policy for the Minimization of Exposure to Construction-Generated Noise and Ground Vibration, including the requirement to only take place during less-sensitive times of day, and be temporary in nature, the impact of construction-generated noise associated the Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would be less than significant for purposes of TRPA and CEQA. For the purposes of NEPA, design features of the mixed-use development sites, including replacement housing, included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize short-term construction noise such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for short-term construction noise impacts as described above for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of short-term construction noise impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact related to short-term construction noise. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would minimize short-term construction noise such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements Alternative D would involve demolition and construction activity in the same general locations as Alternative B and involve the same types of noise-generating construction equipment listed in Table 3.15‐8.  Similar to Alternative B, construction activities with Alternatives D would occur between 8:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. and it is not anticipated that any construction activities would be required outside of these hours without specific noise-reduction requirements imposed by TRPA, the City of South Lake Tahoe and/or Douglas County, Caltrans, and NDOT. Also similar to Alternative B, no single receptor would be exposed to construction-related noise for an excessive period of time due to the linear nature of the project; all construction activity would occur during less noise-sensitive times of day pursuant to the requirements of TRPA, local jurisdictions, and Caltrans; and all construction activity would be required to comply with TRPA’s Best Construction Practices Policy for the Minimization of Exposure to Construction-Generated Noise and Ground Vibration. Therefore, the impact of construction-generated noise associated with the Alternative D transportation improvements would be less than significant for purposes of TRPA and CEQA. For the purposes of NEPA, design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize short-term construction noise such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative D also includes the option to demolish additional existing buildings and construct new mixed-use land uses; however, one of the redevelopment sites would be different from Alternative B, as shown in Exhibit 2-11. Redevelopment of these sites would involve the full and partial acquisition of additional parcels. Thus, demolition and construction activity would occur on the redevelopment sites in addition to the construction activities that would occur with the transportation improvements. Because all construction activity would be required to comply with the requirements of TRPA’s Best Construction Practices Policy for the Minimization of Exposure to Construction-Generated Noise and Ground Vibration, including the requirement to only take place during less-sensitive times of day, and be temporary in nature, the impact of construction-generated noise associated with Alternative D with mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would be less than significant for purposes of TRPA and CEQA. For the purposes of NEPA, design features of the mixed-use development sites, including replacement housing, included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize short-term construction noise such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for short-term construction noise impacts as described above for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of short-term construction noise impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact related to short-term construction noise. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would minimize short-term construction noise such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E would include the construction of a concrete deck in the tourist core, called a skywalk, as shown in Exhibit 2-13. Pile driving would be performed during construction of the skywalk. The types of construction equipment that would be used for Alternative E, and their reference noise levels, are shown in Table 3.15‐8. While pile driving would only occur during daytime hours, it is likely that Alternative E would require some construction activity to be performed outside of the daytime hours between 8:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. to minimize traffic conflicts. Nighttime construction activity could involve the use of multiple types of equipment at the same time, adversely affecting existing nearby visitor-serving land uses. Land uses around the California end of the Alternative E pedestrian platform are zoned as Tourist Center by the Tourist Core Area Plan with a TRPA land use-based noise threshold of 65 CNEL (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2013:5-7 and C-13). Land uses around the Nevada end of the pedestrian deck are zoned as Tourist and are also subject to a TRPA land use-based noise threshold of 65 CNEL (Douglas County and TRPA 2013:24 and 50).  Erection of the skywalk, for instance, could involve operation of a crane, a heavy-duty forklift (e.g., Gradall), a concrete mixing truck, and a concrete pump in close proximity to each other. Some equipment may even be operated on portions of the skywalk that are already built. Applying the reference noise levels for these equipment types listed in Table 3.15‐8, as well as usage factors provided by FHWA (FHWA 2006:3), the combined 24-hour noise level generated by pile driving activity would be 92 CNEL at 50 feet, even if no construction noise were generated during daytime hours. With any intervening barriers the 65 CNEL contour of nighttime construction activity would extend as far as 1,110 feet from the site. Thus, land uses located within this distance of the pedestrian deck could be exposed to noise levels that exceed TRPA’s land use-based noise threshold of 65 CNEL. Also, assuming a standard exterior-to-interior noise reduction of 24 dB (EPA 1978:11), buildings located within 700 feet of construction activity could experience interior noise levels that exceed the interior noise standard of 45 CNEL, including the neighboring resort-casinos and hotels, where visitors could experience sleep disturbance. (See detailed noise calculations in Appendix K.) Estimated noise contour distances do not account for reductions from intervening barriers, including walls, trees, vegetation, or structures of any type; or a tunneling effect that may be generated by the tall buildings that surround the skywalk site. As a result, the impact of construction-generated noise associated with Alternative E would be a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the construction of Alternative E to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to short-term construction noise.  Impact 3.15-2: Ground vibration during construction Alternative A would not include any construction or demolition activity that generates ground vibration. Pile driving activity performed during construction of the pedestrian bridge associated with the Alternative B, C, and D transportation improvements along with construction of the mixed-use development sites could expose nearby buildings to ground vibration levels that exceed FTA’s vibration 80-VdB standard for human response at residential land uses. Pile driving activity performed during construction of the Skywalk under Alternative E could expose nearby buildings and structures to ground vibration levels that exceed FTA’s vibration standard of 0.20 in/sec PPV for structural damage and FTA’s vibration standard of 80 VdB for human response at residential land uses. NEPA Environmental Consequences: Mitigation Measure 3.15-2a has been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D, and Mitigation Measure 3.15-2b has been incorporated into Alternative E to further reduce to the extend feasible adverse construction-related ground vibration; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, and D after implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.15-2a; Significant and Unavoidable for Alternative E after implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.15-2b; No Impact for Alternative A None of the alternatives would include the development of any new major permanent stationary sources of ground vibration. They type of ground vibration that would be generated during construction activity under each alternative is discussed separately below.  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) With Alternative A there would be no improvements to existing US 50, Lake Parkway, or other roadways; and no existing housing units or other buildings would undergo demolition within the project site boundaries. Therefore, there would be no impact pertaining to the exposure of buildings or structures to levels of construction-generated ground vibration that could result in structural damage or human annoyance generated by construction equipment for purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements As described above under Impact 3.15‐1, demolition and construction activities performed for Alternative B would involve the use of heavy-duty trucks and off-road construction equipment. The use of these equipment could generate ground vibration in close proximity to existing structures and buildings, including residential buildings and tourist accommodation units. Operation of heavy construction equipment, particularly pile driving, create seismic waves that radiate along the surface of the earth and downward into the earth. These surface waves can be felt as ground vibration. Vibration from operation of this equipment can result in effects ranging from annoyance of people to damage of structures. Varying geology and distance result in different vibration levels containing different frequencies and displacements. In all cases, vibration amplitudes decrease with increasing distance.  Construction activities generate varying degrees of temporary ground vibration, depending on the specific construction equipment used and activities involved. Ground vibration generated by construction equipment spreads through the ground and diminishes in magnitude with increases in distance. Construction‐related ground vibration is normally associated with impact equipment such as pile drivers, jackhammers, and the operation of some heavy‐duty construction equipment, such as dozers and trucks. Blasting activities also generate relatively high levels of ground vibration but demolition and construction activities are not anticipated to include blasting. The effects of ground vibration may be imperceptible at the lowest levels, result in low rumbling sounds and detectable vibrations at moderate levels, and high levels of vibration can cause sleep disturbance in places where people normally sleep or annoyance in buildings that are primarily used for daytime functions and sleeping. Ground vibration can also potentially damage the foundations and exteriors of existing structures even if it does not result in a negative human response. Table 3.15‐9 shows ground vibration levels for typical construction equipment.  Pile driving produces the highest levels of ground vibration and can result in structural damage to existing buildings. Impact pile drivers produce a high level of vibration for short periods (0.2 seconds) with sufficient time between impacts to allow the resonant effects on a building to decay before the next vibration event (FTA 2006:12 to 14). As shown in Table 3.15‐9, impact pile driving can produce vibration levels up to 1.518 in/sec PPV or 112 VdB at 25 feet. Assuming normal propagation conditions, this level would propagate to less than FTA’s vibration standard of 0.20 in/sec PPV for structural damage at a distance of 100 feet and to levels less than FTA’s vibration standard of 80 VdB for human response at residential land uses at a distance of 300 feet. Ground vibration levels from sonic pile driving would propagate to less than FTA’s vibration standard of 0.20 in/sec PPV for structural damage at a distance of 60 feet and to levels less than FTA’s vibration standard of 80 VdB for human response at residential land uses at a distance of 175 feet. All propagation adjustment calculations are included in Appendix F of the Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy Draft EIR/EIS and incorporated here by reference (Tahoe Metropolitan Planning Organization [TMPO] and TRPA 2012).  Table 3.15-9 Representative Ground Vibration and Noise Levels for Construction Equipment  Type of Equipment  PPV at 25 feet (in/sec)  Approximate Lv (VdB) at 25 feet  Pile Driver (impact) upper range  1.518  112   typical  0.644  104  Pile Driver (sonic) upper range  0.734  105   typical  0.170  93  Blasting1  1.13  109  Large Dozer  0.089  87  Caisson Drilling  0.089  87  Loaded Trucks  0.076  86  Rock Breaker  0.059  83  Jackhammer  0.035  79  Small Dozer  0.003  58  Notes: PPV = peak particle velocity; LV = the root mean square velocity expressed in vibration decibels (VdB), assuming a crest factor of 4. 1 Blasting would not take place with Alternatives A, B, C, D, and E. Source: FTA 2006:12-6 and 12-8.  Pile driving would only be performed during construction of the pedestrian bridge over the realigned US 50 alignment. The closest building to the site of the proposed pedestrian bridge is part of the Forest Suites Resort and is approximately 200 feet from where the nearest location where pile driving could occur. Because this building is more than 100 feet from where pile driving could occur it would not be exposed to levels of ground vibration that exceed FTA’s vibration standard of 0.20 in/sec PPV for structural damage. However, because this building is located within 300 feet of where the pedestrian bridge would be constructed, it would be exposed to ground vibration levels that exceed FTA’s vibration 80-VdB standard for human response at residential land uses. Therefore, this would be a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to ground vibration during construction. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing In addition to the vibration impacts discussed above, demolition and construction of new mixed-use development on the three redevelopment sites (shown in Exhibit 2-9) to include replacement housing would involve more vibration-generating construction activity at these locations. However, it is assumed that no pile driving, blasting, or other high ground vibration-generating activity would occur at these sites. It is not anticipated that the other types of heavy-duty equipment that would be used would expose any nearby buildings to ground vibration levels greater than FTA’s vibration standard of 0.20 in/sec PPV for structural damage or expose any nearby housing units or tourist accommodations to ground vibration levels greater than FTA’s vibration standard of 80 VdB for human response at residential land uses. For these reasons, the impact related to construction of the mixed-use development sites, including replacement housing, would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to ground vibration during construction such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential impacts related to ground vibration during construction as described above for the replacement housing for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the impacts of ground vibration during construction would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a significant impact related to ground vibration during construction. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to ground vibration during construction. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Alternative C would involve demolition and construction activity in the same locations as Alternative B and using the same types of ground vibration-generating construction equipment listed in Table 3.15‐9. Similar to Alternative B, pile driving performed during construction of the pedestrian bridge over realigned US 50, if required, could expose buildings at the Forest Suites Resort to ground vibration levels that exceed FTA’s vibration standard of 80 VdB for human response at residential land uses. This would be a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to ground vibration during construction. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative C would include the demolition of existing buildings and construction of new mixed-use land uses, including replacement housing, on the same redevelopment sites as Alternative B shown in Exhibit 2-9. However, it is assumed that the types of activity that would occur on these sites would not include pile driving, blasting, or other high ground vibration-generating activity. Similar to Alternative B, it is not anticipated that the other types of heavy-duty equipment that would be used would expose any nearby buildings to ground vibration levels greater than FTA’s vibration standard of 0.20 in/sec PPV for structural damage or expose any nearby housing units or tourist accommodations to ground vibration levels greater than FTA’s vibration standard of 80 VdB for human response at residential land uses. For these reasons, the impact related to construction of the mixed-use development sites, including replacement housing, would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to ground vibration during construction such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential impacts related to ground vibration during construction as described above for the replacement housing for the mixed-use development sites.

Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a significant impact related to ground vibration during construction. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to ground vibration during construction. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements Alternative D would involve demolition and construction activity in generally the same locations as Alternative B and using the same types of ground vibration-generating construction equipment listed in Table 3.15‐9. Similar to Alternative B, pile driving performed during construction of the pedestrian bridge over realigned US 50 could expose buildings at the Forest Suites Resort to ground vibration levels that exceed FTA’s vibration standard of 80 VdB for human response at residential land uses. This would be a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to ground vibration during construction. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative D would include the demolition of existing buildings and construction of new mixed-use land uses, including replacement housing, at the redevelopment sites shown in Exhibit 2-11. However, it is assumed that the types of activity that would occur on these sites would not include pile driving, blasting, or other high ground vibration-generating activity. Similar to Alternative B, it is not anticipated that the other types of heavy-duty equipment that would be used would expose any nearby buildings to ground vibration levels greater than FTA’s vibration standard of 0.20 in/sec PPV for structural damage or expose any nearby housing units or tourist accommodations to ground vibration levels greater than FTA’s vibration standard of 80 VdB for human response at residential land uses. For these reasons, the impact related to construction of the mixed-use development sites, including replacement housing, would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to ground vibration during construction such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential impacts related to ground vibration during construction as described above for the replacement housing for the mixed-use development sites.

Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a significant impact related to ground vibration during construction. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to ground vibration during construction. Alternative E: Skywalk The types of ground vibration-generating construction equipment that would be used for construction of the skywalk with Alternative E, and the levels of ground vibration they typically generate, are listed in Table 3.15‐9. Pile driving would produce the highest levels of ground vibration during construction. As explained for Alternative B above, ground vibration generated by impact pile drivers would propagate to less than FTA’s vibration standard of 0.20 in/sec PPV for structural damage at a distance of 100 feet and to levels less than FTA’s vibration standard of 80 VdB for human response at residential land uses at a distance of 300 feet assuming normal propagation conditions. Ground vibration levels from sonic pile driving would propagate to less than FTA’s vibration standard of 0.20 in/sec PPV for structural damage at a distance of 60 feet and to levels less than FTA’s vibration standard of 80 VdB for human response at residential land uses at a distance of 175 feet assuming normal propagation conditions. All propagation adjustment calculations are included in Appendix F of the Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy Draft EIR/EIS (TMPO and TRPA 2012).  The skywalk construction site would be located between buildings along both sides of US 50 and the distance between the buildings on each side of US 50 is approximately 80 feet. Thus, pile driving activity could expose these buildings to levels of ground vibration that exceed FTA’s vibration standard of 0.20 in/sec PPV for structural damage and FTA’s vibration standard of 80 VdB for human response at residential land uses. Therefore, this would be a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into Alternative E to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to ground vibration during construction. Impact 3.15-3: Traffic noise exposure at existing receptors Alternative A would not result in changes to traffic noise levels along US 50 or local roadways.  With Alternatives B, C, and D the 65 CNEL contours along the realigned segments of US 50 would not extend more than 300 feet from the roadway edge for any of the alternatives. Therefore, the Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacity established by TRPA for the transportation corridor would not be exceeded with Alternatives B, C, and D. With Alternatives B, C, and D one or more noise-sensitive receptors would be exposed to noise levels greater than the applicable FHWA noise abatement criteria by the design year (i.e., 2040).  With Alternatives B, C, and D multiple existing noise-sensitive receptors in California would experience increases in traffic noise that are considered substantial by 23 CFR 772 criteria (i.e., increase of 12 dB or more).  With Alternatives B, C, D, and E one or more existing noise-sensitive receptors located outside of a TRPA transportation corridor would be exposed to noise levels that exceed TRPA’s applicable land use-based CNEL threshold. With Alternatives B, C, D, and E multiple noise-sensitive receptors would be exposed to traffic noise levels that exceed the applicable traffic noise standard established by the City of South Lake Tahoe.  With Alternatives B, C, and D multiple noise-sensitive receptors would experience a CNEL increase equal to or greater than 3 dB, which is a TRPA significance criterion and a CEQA significance criterion for receptors located in California. With Alternatives B, C, D, and E one or more existing hotels would be exposed to interior noise levels that exceed the interior noise standard of 45 CNEL.  These exceedances would occur under existing-plus-project conditions (2020) and/or under cumulative-plus-project conditions (2040) with a considerable contribution of the exceedance directly resulting from the implementation of the selected alternative. The intensity of these impacts would not be substantially different with development of the replacement housing at the mixed-use redevelopment sites with Alternatives B, C, and D. NEPA Environmental Consequences: Mitigation Measures 3.15-3a, 3-15-3b, and 3.15-3c have been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D, and Mitigation Measure 3.15-3d has been incorporated into Alternative E, to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations: Significant and Unavoidable for Alternatives B, C, and D after implementation of Mitigation Measures 3.15-3a, 3.15-3b, and 3.15-3c; Less Than Significant for Alternative E after implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.15-3d; No Impact for Alternative A The level of traffic noise at receptors in the study area is primarily affected by their proximity to US 50, the volume of traffic and speed of travel along the highway, and the degree to which surrounding buildings, other structures, and trees and vegetation reflect and/or absorb noise.  With Alternatives B, C, and D, US 50 would be realigned, as shown in Exhibits 2-2, 2-3, and 2-4, respectively. This would include the modification of local roadways, widening of existing roadways, construction of a pedestrian path and modifications to the existing US 50 to become a local street, and the realignment of neighborhood streets to connect with the highway. With these alternatives, vehicle activity on US 50 would be moved closer to some noise-sensitive receptors, resulting in increased levels of noise exposure at those receptors. However, this noise source would also be moved further away from other noise-sensitive receptors in the tourist core, resulting in decreased levels of noise exposure at those receptors. No realignment of US 50 or other roadways would occur under Alternatives A and E.  Traffic noise modeling was conducted for all affected roadway segments under all the alternatives using the FHWA Traffic Noise Model Version 2.5 and data from a project-specific traffic analysis prepared in 2013 (Caltrans 2015b:55).  Table 3.15-10 summarizes changes that would occur to the 65 CNEL traffic contour along US 50 under all the alternatives.  As shown in Table 3.15-10, the 65 CNEL contours along the affected segments of US 50 and the affected portions of Lake Parkway in Nevada would not extend more than 300 feet from the roadway edge for any of the alternatives. Therefore, the Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacity established by TRPA for these transportation corridors would not be exceeded.  Table 3.15-10 Noise Contour Distances along Major Transportation Corridors under Cumulative Conditions  Roadway Segments with Contour-Based Noise Thresholds1  Distance from Edge of Roadway to 65 CNEL Contour (feet) under Cumulative Conditions (2040)2  Existing Conditions/Alt.

The contour-based threshold of 65 CNEL at 300 feet from the edge of the segments of Lake Parkway in Nevada was established by the South Shore Area Plan (Douglas County and TRPA 2013:24). 2  Contour distances would be closer under existing-plus-Alternative B conditions.  3  Alternatives A and E would not include new mixed-use development to provide new housing because no housing units would be removed under these alternatives. 4 With Alternatives B, C, and D, new mixed-use development may occur to replace housing units that are removed to accommodate the realignment of US 50. However, traffic noise levels would not be substantially different with or without the addition of new mixed-use development. Detailed modeling parameters are provided in the Noise Study Report and are incorporated by reference here (Caltrans2015b).  Source: Modeling by LSA Associates in Caltrans 2015b; Post-processing by Ascent Environmental in 2016   Nonetheless, because the location of the TRPA transportation corridor would move with the realigned segments of US 50 under Alternatives B, C, and D, the applicable TRPA noise threshold would change for some receptors. This is due to the relationship between TRPA’s land use-based noise thresholds and TRPA’s contour-based noise threshold for the US 50 transportation corridor. As explained in Table 3.15-4 in the regulatory setting and in the “Methods and Assumptions” sections above, TRPA’s traffic noise threshold for the US 50 transportation corridor is a contour-based noise threshold that overrides the land use-based CNEL thresholds within 300 feet of the highway’s edge. This means that some receptors currently subject to a TRPA land use-based noise standard (because they beyond 300 feet from the existing alignment of US 50) would instead become subject to the contour-based noise threshold of US 50 because the realigned highway would move to within 300 feet of them. For instance, under existing conditions Receptor 63 is subject to the land use-based noise standard of 55 CNEL established in PAS 092 Pioneer Ski/Run (TRPA 2002c:3). However, implementation of Alternative B would result in Receptor 63 being subject to the TRPA contour-based noise standard for US 50, because Receptor 63 would be within 300 feet of the realigned segment of US 50. The opposite change occurs at other receptors; that is, some receptors currently subject to TRPA’s contour-based noise threshold for US 50 would become subject to one of TRPA’s land use-based noise thresholds. For example, receptors located within 300 feet of the existing segment of US 50 between Pioneer Trial and Lake Parkway are currently subject to the TRPA’s contour-based threshold for US 50; however, they would be subject to the applicable land use-based threshold after US 50 is realigned under Alternatives B, C, and D. Additional analysis of the noise impacts to discrete receptors located inside and outside of the US 50 transportation corridor is provided below.  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) There would be no change in traffic noise levels as a result of Alternative A because this alternative would not result in realignment of any segments of US 50, or changes in the traffic volumes or travel speeds of various segments of US 50, Lake Parkway, or other local roads. For this reason, there would be no impact related to traffic noise under Alternative A for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Table 3.15-11 summarizes the predicted noise levels that would be experienced at those noise-sensitive receptors that would be most affected by Alternative B (but would not be acquired through the right-of-way acquisition process). Exhibit 3.15-2 shows the locations of these receptors and the type of impact(s) they would experience. As shown in Table 3.15-11, one receptor, Receptor 136, would experience noise levels greater than the applicable FHWA noise abatement criteria by the design year (i.e., 2040) and 15 receptors would experience increases in traffic noise that are considered substantial by Caltrans criteria (i.e., 12 dB or more)—all of these receptors are located in California. Six receptors would be exposed to noise levels that exceed TRPA’s applicable land use-based CNEL threshold, 18 receptors would be exposed to noise levels that exceed the transportation noise standards established by the City of South Lake Tahoe, and 30 receptors would experience a CNEL increase equal to or greater than 3 dB, which is a TRPA significance criterion (and a CEQA significance criterion for receptors located in California). Also, Receptor 55, which is a motel called the South Shore Inn, could be exposed to interior noise levels that exceed 45 CNEL. These exceedances would occur under existing-plus-Alternative B conditions and/or under cumulative-plus-Alternative B conditions with a considerable contribution of the exceedance directly resulting from the implementation of Alternative B. As shown in Exhibit 3.15-2, the locations of these receptors would be closer to the realigned segment of US 50 that would exist under Alternative B than the existing alignment of US 50. Fundamentally, Alternative B would move a segment of US 50 (both west- and east-bound traffic), which is the predominant noise source in the area, closer to these receptors. Most of the receptors that would be impacted are located in the Rocky Point neighborhood southwest of the Heavenly Village Center along Fern Road, Echo Road, Moss Road, Primrose Road, Rocky Point Road, and Chonokis Road. Receptors 1, 4, and 5 are residential land uses located along a segment of US 50 that would not be realigned but these receptors would be exposed to traffic noise levels in 2040 that exceed the City of South Lake Tahoe’s noise standard of 60 CNEL with a considerable contribution by Alternative B. Receptor 136 is a motel called the Cedar Inn & Suites located on the corner of Stateline Avenue and Pine Boulevard that would be exposed to a noise levels greater than 65 CNEL, which is the threshold established by TRPA in the Tourist Core Area Plan (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2013:C-13). For these reasons this impact for the Alternative B transportation improvements would be significant for purposes of TRPA and CEQA. Table 3.15-11 Summary of Traffic Noise Impacts at Discrete Noise-Sensitive Receptors under Alternative B    Modeled Traffic Noise Levels1 (Leq[h], CNEL)2  NEPA Impact Analysis  TRPA Impact Analysis  CEQA Impact Analysis 9  Receptor No. 3  Existing  Existing-Plus-Alternative B  Change from Existing to Existing-Plus-Alternative B  2038-No-Project  2038-Plus-Alternative B  Change from 2038-No-Project to 2038-Plus-Alternative B  Change from Existing to 2038-Plus-Alternative B  FHWA Noise Abatement Criteria, Leq[h] 4  Noise Abatement Criterion Exceeded or Approached?

All noise levels are expressed in A-weighted decibels. 3 This table only includes discrete modeling receptor sites where one or more NEPA, TRPA, CEQA significance criteria and/or a TRPA land use-based CNEL threshold would be exceeded. No significance criteria or TRPA thresholds were predicted to be exceeded at all other modeled discrete receptors. The discrete modeling receptor sites are often referred to as “receptors” in this table and in this EIR/EIS/EIS; however, a single discrete modeling receptor site may be representative of multiple nearby receptors that are equidistant or closer to the nearby roadway that is the predominant source of noise at those receptors. Thus, this EIR/EIS/EIS recognizes that and exceedance of an applicable noise standard at a single modeled receptor site may indicate exposure that would be experienced by land uses equidistant or closer to the highway in that area. Receptor 142, which is located on the sidewalk next to the entrance driveway to Van Sickle Bi-State Park, was not included in this table because it does not represent an outdoor activity area or distinct destination where people gather or otherwise spend time.  4 This significance criterion for the NEPA impact analysis is equivalent to the Noise Abatement Criterion (NAC) for the applicable activity category listed in Table 3.15-3. The NAC have been adopted as significance standards by both Caltrans and NDOT.  5 The applicable NAC is compared to the predicted noise level for the design year (i.e., 2040) at a noise-sensitive receptor. This comparison is used for both the project-level and cumulative impact analysis. A sound level is considered to “approach” an NAC level if the sound level is 1 dB less than the NAC. 6 The NEPA incremental increase criteria are compared to the change in the traffic noise level between existing conditions and the design year (i.e., 2040). This comparison is also used for both the project-level and cumulative impact analysis. 7 TRPA’s land use-based noise thresholds are listed in Table 3.15-4 and do not apply to receptors located within 300 feet of the edge of US 50 or the edge of the segments of Lake Parkway in Nevada. These receptors are marked with “NA”  8 For the TRPA and CEQA analyses, an incremental increase significance criterion of 3 dB is compared to the difference between existing noise levels and existing-plus-alternative noise levels. 9 The CEQA impact analysis only applies to receptors located in California. 10 For receptors located in the City of South Lake Tahoe the applicable noises standard is based on the standards in Table 3.15-5. As explained in Table 3.15-5, for hotels, motels, and other transient lodging facilities that do not have an outdoor activity area such as a pool, the city’s exterior noise standard of 65 CNEL does not apply. For receptors located in the unincorporated area of El Dorado County, the transportation noise standard from Chapter 130.37 of the County’s zoning ordinance is applied.  Source: Traffic noise levels modeled by LSA (Caltrans2015b); Impact analysis conducted by Ascent Environmental 2016     Exhibit 3.15-2 Alternative B Noise Receptors and Noise Impacts For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative B includes the redevelopment of three multi-use development sites, which would provide replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Redevelopment of these sites would involve the full and partial acquisition of additional parcels including, as shown in Exhibit 3.15-2, full acquisition of Receptors 55, 56, 65, and 67. Thus, these receptors would not experience the noise impacts listed in Table 3.15-11 after they are removed.  Operation of the land uses constructed on the three multi-use development sites would add additional noise-generating vehicles to the local roadway network. As explained in the “Methods and Assumptions” section above, the traffic volumes used to estimate traffic noise levels in the Noise Study Report were conservatively high such that they also account for the additional vehicle trips that would be generated by operation of the three mixed-use development sites. Also explained above is that the difference in traffic volumes with the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites is not substantial given the logarithmic nature of adding and subtracting noise levels (i.e., it takes a doubling of the noise-generating activity, in this case the traffic volume, to result in a 3-dB noise increase). Therefore, there would be no measurable difference in traffic noise levels generated under Alternative B with or without the mixed-use development. As shown in Table 3.15-11, the 65 CNEL contour along the affected segments of US 50 and the affected portions of Lake Parkway in Nevada would not extend more than 300 feet from the roadway edge and, thus, the Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacity established by TRPA for these transportation corridors would not be exceeded. Similarly, there would be no measurable difference in the traffic noise levels predicted at existing discrete sensitive receptors, which are summarized in Table 3.15-11. Therefore, the traffic noise impacts in Alternative B with the mixed-use development at existing discrete receptors would be the same as those with the transportation improvements and this impact would be significant for purposes of TRPA and CEQA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential impacts related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels as described above for the replacement housing for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the exposure of sensitive receptors at another location to increased traffic noise levels would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a significant impact related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Table 3.15-12 summarizes the predicted noise levels that would be experienced at those noise-sensitive receptors that would be most affected under Alternative C (but would not be acquired). Exhibit 3.15-3 shows the locations of these receptors and the type of impact(s) they would experience. As shown in Table 3.15-12, one receptor, Receptor 55, would experience noise levels greater than the applicable FHWA noise abatement criteria by the design year (i.e., 2040) and 10 receptors would experience increases in traffic noise that are considered substantial by Caltrans criteria (i.e., 12 dB or more)—all of these receptors are located in California. One receptor would be exposed to noise levels that exceed TRPA’s applicable land use-based CNEL threshold. Receptor 136, a motel called the Cedar Inn & Suites located on the corner of Stateline Avenue and Pine Boulevard, would be exposed to a noise levels greater than 65 CNEL, which is the threshold established by TRPA in the Tourist Core Area Plan (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2013:C-13). Ten receptors would be exposed to noise levels that exceed the transportation noise standards established by the City of South Lake Tahoe, and 27 receptors would experience a CNEL increase equal to or greater than 3 dB, which is a TRPA significance criterion (and a CEQA significance criterion for receptors located in California). Receptor 55, which is a motel called the South Shore Inn, could also be exposed to interior noise levels that exceed 45 CNEL. These exceedances would occur under existing-plus-Alternative C conditions and/or under cumulative-plus-Alternative C conditions with a considerable contribution of the exceedance directly resulting from the implementation of Alternative C. As shown in Exhibit 3.15-3, the locations of these receptors would be closer to the realigned segment of east bound US 50 than the existing alignment of US 50. Essentially, Alternative C would move the east-bound segment of US 50, thereby moving a portion of the predominant noise source in the area closer to these receptors. Most of the receptors that would be impacted are located in the Rocky Point neighborhood along Echo Road, Moss Road, Primrose Road, Rocky Point Road, and Chonokis Road. For these reasons, this impact would be significant for purposes of TRPA and CEQA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels.   Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative C includes the redevelopment of three multi-use development sites, which would provide replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Redevelopment of these sites would involve the full and partial acquisition of additional parcels including, as shown in Exhibit 3.15-3, full acquisition of Receptors 23, 55, 65, and 67. Thus, these receptors would not experience the noise impacts listed in Table 3.15-12 after they are removed.  Similar to Alternative B, operation of the land uses constructed on the three multi-use development sites with Alternative C would add additional noise-generating vehicles to the local roadway network. As explained in the “Methods and Assumptions” section above, the traffic volumes used to estimate traffic noise levels in the Noise Study Report were conservatively high such that they also account for the additional vehicle trips that would be generated by operation of the three mixed-use development sites. Also explained above is that the difference in traffic volumes with the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites is not substantial given the logarithmic nature of adding and subtracting noise levels (i.e., it takes a doubling of the noise-generating activity, in this case the traffic volume, to result in a 3-dB noise increase). Therefore, there would be no measurable difference in traffic noise levels generated under Alternative C with or without the mixed-use development. As shown in Table 3.15-12, the 65 CNEL contour along the affected segments of US 50 and the affected portions of Lake Parkway in Nevada would not extend more than 300 feet from the roadway edge and, thus, the Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacity established by TRPA for these transportation corridors would not be exceeded. Similarly, there would be no measurable difference in the traffic noise levels predicted at existing discrete sensitive receptors, which are summarized in Table 3.15-12. Therefore, the traffic noise impacts with the mixed-use development at existing discrete receptors would be the same as those with the transportation improvements and this impact would be significant for purposes of TRPA and CEQA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels.   Table 3.15-12 Summary of Traffic Noise Impacts at Discrete Noise-Sensitive Receptors under Alternative C    Modeled Traffic Noise Levels1 (Leq[h], CNEL)2  NEPA Impact Analysis  TRPA Impact Analysis  CEQA Impact Analysis 9  Receptor No. 3  Existing  Existing-Plus-Alternative C  Change from Existing to Existing-Plus-Alternative C  2038-No-Project  2038-Plus-Alternative C  Change from 2038-No-Project to 2038-Plus-Alternative C  Change from Existing to 2038-Plus-Alternative C  FHWA Noise Abatement Criteria, Leq[h] 4  Noise Abatement Criterion Exceeded or Approached?

A sound level is considered to “approach” an NAC level if the sound level is 1 dB less than the NAC. 6 The NEPA incremental increase criteria are compared to the change in the traffic noise level between existing conditions and the design year (i.e., 2040). This comparison is also used for both the project-level and cumulative impact analysis. 7 TRPA’s land use-based noise thresholds are listed in Table 3.15-4 and do not apply to receptors located within 300 feet of the edge of US 50 or the edge of the segments of Lake Parkway in Nevada. These receptors are marked with “NA” 8 For the TRPA and CEQA analyses, an incremental increase significance criterion of 3 dB is compared to the difference between existing noise levels and existing-plus-alternative noise levels. 9 The CEQA impact analysis only applies to receptors located in California. 10 For receptors located in the City of South Lake Tahoe the applicable noises standard is based on the standards in Table 3.15-5. As explained in Table 3.15-5, for hotels, motels, and other transient lodging facilities that do not have an outdoor activity area such as a pool, the City’s exterior noise standard of 65 CNEL does not apply. For receptors located in the unincorporated area of El Dorado County, the transportation noise standard from Chapter 130.37 of the County’s zoning ordinance is applied.  Source: Traffic noise levels modeled by LSA (Caltrans2015b); Impact analysis conducted by Ascent Environmental 2016     Exhibit 3.15-3 Alternative C Noise Receptors and Impacts Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential impacts related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels as described above for the replacement housing for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the exposure of sensitive receptors at another location to increased traffic noise levels would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a significant impact related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements Table 3.15-13 summarizes the predicted noise levels that would be experienced at those noise-sensitive receptors that would be most affected by Alternative D (but would not be acquired). Exhibit 3.15-4 shows the locations of these receptors and the type of impact(s) they would experience. As shown in Table 3.15-13, no receptors would experience noise levels greater than the applicable FHWA noise abatement criteria by the design year (i.e., 2040).  Receptors 42, 68, 71, 83, and 84 would experience increases in traffic noise that are considered substantial by Caltrans criteria (i.e., 12 dB or more) by the design year. All of these receptors are located in California. Receptors 30, 97, and 98 are single-family homes that would become exposed to noise levels that exceed the TRPA land use-based noise threshold of 55 CNEL established in PAS 092 Pioneer/Ski Run (TRPA 2002c:3). Receptor 136, a motel called the Cedar Inn & Suites located on the corner of Stateline Avenue and Pine Boulevard, would become exposed to a noise level greater than 65 CNEL, which is the threshold established by TRPA in the Tourist Core Area Plan (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2013:C-13). Receptor 29, a multi-family residence on the east side of Pioneer Trial, has an existing noise level of 64 CNEL that already exceeds the TRPA land use-based noise threshold of 55 CNEL established in PAS 092 Pioneer/Ski Run (TRPA 2002c:3). Receptor 29 would experience a noise level of 67 CNEL under existing-plus-Alternative D conditions and 68 CNEL under cumulative-plus-Alternative D conditions. Thus, implementation of Alternative D would increase the degree to which Receptor 29 would experience traffic noise levels that exceed the applicable TRPA threshold.  Receptors 1, 5, and 8, which are single-family homes along a segment of US 50 that would not be realigned, would be exposed to traffic noise levels in 2040 that exceed the City of South Lake Tahoe’s noise standard of 60 CNEL with a measurable contribution from Alternative D.   Table 3.15-13 Summary of Traffic Noise Impacts at Discrete Noise-Sensitive Receptors under Alternative D    Modeled Traffic Noise Levels1 (Leq[h], CNEL)2  NEPA Impact Analysis  TRPA Impact Analysis  CEQA Impact Analysis 9  Receptor No. 3  Existing  Existing-Plus-Alternative D  Change from Existing to Existing-Plus-Alternative D  2038-No-Project  2038-Plus-Alternative D  Change from 2038-No-Project to 2038-Plus-Alternative D  Change from Existing to 2038-Plus-Alternative D  FHWA Noise Abatement Criteria, Leq[h] 4  Noise Abatement Criterion Exceeded or Approached?

All noise levels are expressed in A-weighted decibels. 3 This table only includes discrete modeling receptor sites where one or more NEPA, TRPA, CEQA significance criteria and/or a TRPA land use-based CNEL threshold would be exceeded. No significance criteria or TRPA thresholds were predicted to be exceeded at all other modeled discrete receptors. The discrete modeling receptor sites are often referred to as “receptors” in this table and in this EIR/EIS/EIS; however, a single discrete modeling receptor site may be representative of multiple nearby receptors that are equidistant or closer to the nearby roadway that is the predominant source of noise at those receptors. Thus, this EIR/EIS/EIS recognizes that an exceedance of an applicable noise standard at a single modeled receptor site may indicate exposure that would be experienced by land uses (e.g., other surrounding homes) equidistant or closer to the highway in that area. Receptor 142, which is located on the sidewalk next to the edge of pavement at the entrance driveway to Van Sickle Bi-State Park, was not included in this table because it does not represent an outdoor activity area or distinct destination where people gather or otherwise spend time.  4 This significance criterion for the NEPA impact analysis is equivalent to the Noise Abatement Criterion (NAC) for the applicable activity category listed in Table 3.15-3. The NAC have been adopted as significance standards by both Caltrans and NDOT.  5 The applicable NAC is compared to the predicted noise level for the design year (i.e., 2040) at a noise-sensitive receptor. This comparison is used for both the project-level and cumulative impact analysis. A sound level is considered to “approach” an NAC level if the sound level is 1 dB less than the NAC. 6 The NEPA incremental increase criteria are compared to the change in the traffic noise level between existing conditions and the design year (i.e., 2040). This comparison is also used for both the project-level and cumulative impact analysis. 7 TRPA’s land use-based noise thresholds are listed in Table 3.15-4 and do not apply to receptors located within 300 feet of the edge of US 50 or the edge of the segments of Lake Parkway in Nevada. These receptors are marked with “NA” 8 For the TRPA and CEQA analyses, an incremental increase significance criterion of 3 dB is compared to the difference between existing noise levels and existing-plus-alternative noise levels. 9 The CEQA impact analysis only applies to receptors located in California. 10 For receptors located in the City of South Lake Tahoe the applicable noises standard is based on the standards in Table 3.15-5. As explained in Table 3.15-5, for hotels, motels, and other transient lodging facilities that do not have an outdoor activity area such as a pool, the City’s exterior noise standard of 65 CNEL does not apply. For receptors located in the unincorporated area of El Dorado County, the transportation noise standard from Chapter 130.37 of the County’s zoning ordinance is applied.  Source: Traffic noise levels modelled by LSA (Caltrans2015b). Impact analysis conducted by Ascent Environmental 2016.     Exhibit 3.15-4 Alternative D Noise Receptors and Noise Impacts Thirteen receptors would be exposed to noise levels that exceed the transportation noise standards established by the City of South Lake Tahoe, and 46 receptors would experience a CNEL increase equal to or greater than 3 dB, which is a TRPA significance criterion (and a CEQA significance criterion for receptors located in California). These exceedances would occur under existing-plus-Alternative D conditions and/or under cumulative-plus-Alternative D conditions with a considerable contribution of the exceedance directly resulting from the implementation of Alternative D. As shown in Exhibit 3.15-4, many of these receptors would be closer to the realigned segment of US 50 that would occur with Alternative D than the highway’s existing alignment. Fundamentally, Alternative D would move a segment of US 50 (both west- and east-bound lanes), which is the predominant noise source in the area, closer to these receptors. Most of the receptors that would be impacted are located in the Rocky Point neighborhood along Fern Road, Echo Road, Moss Road, Primrose Road, Rocky Point Road, and Chonokis Road. Receptor 20, which is a motel called the Trailhead Motel located along the east side of US 50 that would not be realigned, could be exposed to interior noise levels that exceed 45 CNEL.  For these reasons this impact would be significant for purposes TRPA and CEQA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing  Alternative D includes the redevelopment of three multi-use development sites, which would provide replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Redevelopment of these sites would involve the full and partial acquisition of additional parcels including, as shown in Exhibit 3.15-4, full acquisition of Receptors 68, 96, 97, and 98. Thus, these receptors would not experience the noise impacts listed in Table 3.15-13 after they are removed.  Operation of the land uses constructed on the three multi-use development sites would add additional noise-generating vehicles to the local roadway network. As explained in the “Methods and Assumptions” section above, the traffic volumes used to estimate traffic noise levels in the Noise Study Report were conservatively high such that they also account for the additional vehicle trips that would be generated by operation of the three mixed-use development sites. Also explained above is that the difference in traffic volumes with the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites is not substantial given the logarithmic nature of adding and subtracting noise levels (i.e., it takes a doubling of the noise-generating activity, in this case the traffic volume, to result in a 3-dB noise increase). Therefore, there would be no measurable difference in traffic noise levels generated under Alternative D with or without the mixed-use development. As shown in Table 3.15-13, the 65 CNEL contour along the affected segments of US 50 and the affected portions of Lake Parkway in Nevada would not extend more than 300 feet from the roadway edge and, thus, the Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacity established by TRPA for these transportation corridors would not be exceeded. Similarly, there would be no measurable difference in the traffic noise levels predicted at existing discrete sensitive receptors, which are summarized in Table 3.15-13. Therefore, the traffic noise impacts with the mixed-use development sites at existing discrete receptors would be the same as those with the transportation improvements and this impact would be significant for purposes of TRPA and CEQA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels.  Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential impacts related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels as described above for the replacement housing for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the exposure of sensitive receptors at another location to increased traffic noise levels would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a significant impact related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels. Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E would not include the realignment of US 50. Alternative E would feature a concrete deck over the entire width and length of existing US 50 within the tourist core between a location about 100 feet south of Stateline Avenue and a location near the northern end of the Montbleu Resort (about 450 feet south of Lake Parkway). None of the existing receptors would be acquired because there would not be any realignment of the US 50 right of way.  Table 3.15-14 summarizes the predicted noise levels that would be experienced at the noise-sensitive receptors that would be most affected by Alternative E. The receptors listed in Table 3.15-14 are those that would experience exceedance of applicable thresholds or significance criteria under existing-plus-Alternative E conditions and/or under cumulative-plus-Alternative E conditions with a considerable contribution of the exceedance directly resulting from the implementation of Alternative E. The locations of all the impacted receptors and the type of noise impact they would experience (i.e., NEPA, TRPA, and/or CEQA) are shown in Exhibit 3.15-5. With Alternative E, none of the receptors would be exposed to noise levels greater than the applicable FHWA noise abatement criteria or experience increases in traffic noise that are considered substantial by Caltrans or NDOT by the design year (i.e., 2040). Therefore, the environmental consequences from traffic noise exposure of implementing Alternative E would not be adverse for purposes of NEPA.  Receptor 136, which is a motel called the Cedar Suites & Inn located on the corner of Stateline Avenue and Pine Boulevard, would be exposed to a noise level greater than the 65 CNEL threshold established in the Tourist Core Area Plan (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2013:C-13). This exceedance would occur under the cumulative-plus-Alternative E condition with a 1 dB contribution by Alternative E. See the discussion below regarding the 3-dB increase significance standard TRPA uses for environmental compliance.  None of the modeled receptors would experience a CNEL increase equal to or greater than 3 dB, which is both a TRPA significance criterion and a CEQA significance criterion for receptors located in California. Alternative E, however, would result in or contribute to an exceedance of exceed the applicable transportation noise standards established by the City of South Lake Tahoe, including Receptors 20, 99, 102, 107, 135, and 136. Receptor 20, which is a motel called the Trailhead Motel, and Receptor 107, which is a motel called the Park Tahoe Aspen Court, could also potentially experience interior noise levels that exceed 45 CNEL under cumulative conditions, with a measurable contribution from Alternative E. Therefore, this impact would be significant for purposes of TRPA and CEQA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative E to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels.  Table 3.15-14 Summary of Traffic Noise Impacts at Discrete Noise-Sensitive Receptors under Alternative E    Modeled Traffic Noise Levels1 (Leq[h], CNEL)2  NEPA Impact Analysis  TRPA Impact Analysis  CEQA Impact Analysis 9  Receptor No. 3  Existing  Existing-Plus-Alternative E  Change from Existing to Existing-Plus-Alternative E  2038-No-Project  2038-Plus-Alternative E  Change from 2038-No-Project to 2038-Plus-Alternative  Change from Existing to 2038-Plus-Alternative E  FHWA Noise Abatement Criteria, Leq[h] 4  Noise Abatement Criterion Exceeded or Approached? 5  NEPA Incremental Increase Criterion Exceeded? 6  TRPA Land Use-Based Noise Threshold Under Alternative E (CNEL) 7  Exceed (or Contribute to an Exceedance of) TRPA Land Use-Based Noise Standard?  TRPA Incremental Increase  Criterion Exceeded? 8  Local Jurisdiction  Noise Standard of Local Jurisdiction (CNEL) 10  Exceed (or Contribute to an Exceedance of) Local Noise  Standard?  CEQA Incremental Increase Criterion Exceeded? 8  20  67  68  1  70  70  0  3  72  No  No  NA  NA  No  CSLT  65  Yes  No  99  65  66  1  67  67  0  2  72  No  No  NA  NA  No  CSLT  65  Yes  No  102  67  68  1  69  69  0  2  72  No  No  NA  NA  No  CSLT  65  Yes  No  107  69  70  1  71  71  0  2  72  No  No  NA  NA  No  CSLT  65  Yes  No  135  66  67  1  68  68  0  2  72  No  No  NA  NA  No  CSLT  65  Yes  No  136  65  64  -1  67  68  1  3  72  No  No  65  Yes  No  CSLT  65  Yes  No  Notes: dB = decibel, Leq[h] = peak-hour noise level, FHWA = Federal Highway Administration.

All noise levels are expressed in A-weighted decibels. 3 This table only includes discrete modeling receptor sites where one or more NEPA, TRPA, CEQA significance criteria and/or a TRPA land use-based CNEL threshold would be exceeded. No significance criteria or TRPA thresholds were predicted to be exceeded at all other modeled discrete receptors. A single discrete modeling receptor site may be representative of multiple nearby receptors (e.g., surrounding homes) that are equidistant or closer to the nearby roadway noise source. Thus, this EIR/EIS/EIS recognizes that and exceedance of an applicable noise standard at a single modeled receptor site may indicate exposure that would be experienced by land uses equidistant or closer to the highway in that area.  4 This significance criterion for the NEPA impact analysis is equivalent to the Noise Abatement Criterion (NAC) for the applicable activity category listed in Table 3.15-3. The NAC have been adopted as significance standards by both Caltrans and NDOT.  5 The applicable NAC is compared to the predicted noise level for the design year (i.e., 2040) at a noise-sensitive receptor. This comparison is used for both the project-level and cumulative impact analysis. A sound level is considered to “approach” an NAC level if the sound level is 1 dB less than the NAC. 6 The NEPA incremental increase criteria are compared to the change in the traffic noise level between existing conditions and the design year (i.e., 2040). This comparison is also used for both the project-level and cumulative impact analysis. 7 TRPA’s land use-based noise thresholds are listed in Table 3.15-4 and do not apply to receptors located within 300 feet of the edge of US 50 or the edge of the segments of Lake Parkway in Nevada. These receptors are marked with “NA” 8 For the TRPA and CEQA analyses, an incremental increase significance criterion of 3 dB is compared to the difference between existing noise levels and existing-plus-alternative noise levels. 9 The CEQA impact analysis only applies to receptors located in California. 10 For receptors located in the City of South Lake Tahoe the applicable noises standard is based on the standards in Table 3.15-5. As explained in Table 3.15-5, for hotels, motels, and other transient lodging facilities that do not have an outdoor activity area such as a pool, the City’s exterior noise standard of 65 CNEL does not apply. For receptors located in the unincorporated area of El Dorado County, the transportation noise standard from Chapter 130.37 of the County’s zoning ordinance is applied.  Source: Traffic noise levels modelled by LSA (Caltrans2015b).

Therefore, this impact would be less than significant for purposes of TRPA threshold compliance.  Common outdoor activity areas could be included on the mixed-use redevelopment sites that would potentially be developed under Alternatives B, C, and D. These common outdoor activity areas could be exposed to traffic noise levels that exceed the City of South Lake Tahoe’s 60 CNEL standard.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: Mitigation Measure 3.15-4 has been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D to further reduce to the extent feasible the potential to expose land uses to an incompatible noise environment; No Impact for Alternatives A and E CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less than Significant for Alternatives B, C, and D after implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.15-4; No Impact for Alternatives A and E Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Alternative A does not include the redevelopment of any areas within the project site. Therefore, Alternative A would not locate new noise-sensitive receptors where they would be exposed to noise levels that exceed applicable federal noises standards, TRPA noise thresholds or standards, or noise standards established by the local City or County. There would be no impact pertaining to the exposure of new land uses to excessive noise levels for NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA purposes.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Alternative B would include the redevelopment of three sites with a mix of residential and commercial uses. Details about design of these mixed-use redevelopment sites are not known at this time. The purpose of the redevelopment sites would be to provide relocation opportunities for dislocated residents and business owners in the immediate vicinity. The location and potential mix of uses that could be developed at these sites are shown in Exhibit 3.15-2, as well as Exhibits 2-9 and 2-10. Multi-family housing units would be the most noise-sensitive of the land uses located on these sites.  Site 1 and Site 3 are part of the Tourist Core Area Plan and are zoned as Tourist Center Mixed-Use and Tourist Center Core, respectively, both with a TRPA land use-based noise threshold of 65 CNEL (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2013:5-7 and C-13). However, as shown in Exhibit 3.15-2, the southern portion of Site 1 and all of Site 3 would be located within 300 feet of the edge of the realigned US 50 where TRPA’s land use-based 65 CNEL threshold would not apply. Instead, TRPA’s contour-based highway standard for US 50 would apply.  Site 2 currently includes areas with three separate land use designations. One portion of Site 2 is part of the Tourist Core Area Plan and zoned as Tourist Center Neighborhood Mixed-Use with a TRPA noise threshold of 65 CNEL (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2013:5-7 and C-13). Another portion of Site 2 is also part of the Tourist Core Area Plan but is zoned as Open Space with a TRPA noise threshold of 55 CNEL (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2013:5-7 and C-13). A third portion of Site 2 is currently part of PAS 092 Pioneer/Ski Run with a TRPA noise threshold of 55 CNEL (TRPA 2002c:3). It is assumed that the portion of Site 2 that is currently zoned as Open Space would be rezoned and assigned a TRPA noise threshold of 65 CNEL that would be consistent with other areas zoned for mixed-use. Similar to the southern portion of Site 1, the southern portion of Site 2, including the portion in the PAS 092 Pioneer/Ski Run, would be located within 300 feet of the edge of the realigned US 50 where TRPA’s contour-based highway standard for US 50 would apply in place of TRPA’s land use-based CNEL thresholds. This is also shown in Exhibit 3.15-2.  As shown in Table 3.15-10, the 65 CNEL contour along the nearest segment of realigned US 50 would not extend more than 300 feet from the edge of the highway under cumulative-plus-Alternative B conditions. Therefore, no portions of Sites 1, 2, and 3 would be exposed to noise levels that exceed TRPA noise thresholds. This impact would be less than significant for purposes of TRPA threshold compliance.  Interior noise levels of these developments would be required to meet interior noise level standards pursuant to Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations. Common outdoor activity areas on these development sites, particularly those associated with residential use, would be subject to the City of South Lake Tahoe’s 60 CNEL standard presented in Table 3.15-5. According to the Noise Study Report, the 60 CNEL traffic noise contour would extend 304 feet from the centerline of the nearby segment of realigned US 50 (Caltrans 2015b:173). Thus, some areas of Site 1 and Site 2 and all of Site 3 would be located within the 60 CNEL traffic noise contour. If any outdoor activity areas were located within this distance without any intervening buildings or structures to provide noise protection, then they would be exposed to noise levels that exceed the noise standard established by the City of South Lake Tahoe under cumulative-plus-Alternative B conditions. Moreover, traffic on local roadways could also contribute to noise on the sites (i.e., Lake Tahoe Boulevard west of Site 1, Pioneer Trail between Sites 1 and 2, Heavenly Village Way north of Site 3). As a result, this would be a potentially significant impact for purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Conclusion For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the potential to expose land uses to an incompatible noise environment. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential impacts related to the exposure of land uses to an incompatible noise environment as described above for the replacement housing for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the noise/land use compatibility impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Alternative C would also include the redevelopment of three sites with a mix of residential and commercial uses. The location of the three development sites would be the same as with Alternative B and shown in Exhibit 3.15-3, as well as Exhibits 2-9 and 2-10. The new realigned portion of US 50 would only carry east-bound traffic and the existing US 50 alignment would continue to carry west-bound traffic. Thus, as shown in Exhibit 3.15-3, all of Sites 1, 2, and 3 would be located within 300 feet of the edge of east-bound US 50 and/or west-bound US 50 where TRPA’s contour-based highway standard for US 50 would apply in place of TRPA’s land use-based CNEL thresholds.  As shown in Table 3.15-10, the 65 CNEL contour along the nearest segment of both the east- and west-bound segments of US 50 would not extend more than 300 feet from the edge of the highway under cumulative-plus-Alternative C conditions. Therefore, no portions of Sites 1, 2, and 3 would be exposed to noise levels that exceed TRPA noise thresholds. This impact would be less than significant for purposes of TRPA threshold compliance.  As with Alternative B, interior noise levels of these developments would be required to meet interior noise level standards pursuant to Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations. Common outdoor activity areas on these development sites, particularly those associated with residential use, would be subject to the City of South Lake Tahoe’s 60 CNEL standard presented in Table 3.15-5. According to the Noise Study Report, the 60 CNEL traffic noise contour along nearby east-bound US 50 would extend 190 feet from the centerline of the nearby segment of east-bound US 50 and the 263 feet from the centerline of the nearby segment of west-bound US 50 (Caltrans 2015b:174). Thus, most of Site 1 and Site 2 and all of Site 3 would be located within the 60 CNEL traffic noise contour. If any outdoor activity areas were located within this distance without any intervening buildings or structures to provide noise protection, then they would be exposed to noise levels that exceed the noise standard established by the City of South Lake Tahoe. Moreover, traffic on local roadways could also contribute to noise on the sites (i.e., Pioneer Trail between Sites 1 and 2, Heavenly Village Way north of Site 3). As a result, this would be a potentially significant impact for purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Conclusion For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the potential to expose land uses to an incompatible noise environment. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential impacts related to the exposure of land uses to an incompatible noise environment as described above for the replacement housing for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the noise/land use compatibility impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Alternative D would include the redevelopment of three sites with a mix of residential and commercial uses. The locations of the three development sites are shown in Exhibit 3.15-4, as well as Exhibits 2-11 and 2-12.  As shown in Exhibit 3.15-4, all of the redevelopment sites would be located within 300 feet of the edge of the realigned portion of US 50. Thus, TRPA’s contour-based highway standard of for US 50 would apply to all the redevelopment sites. As shown in Table 3.15-10, the 65 CNEL contour along the nearest segment of realigned US 50 would not extend more than 300 feet from the edge of the highway under cumulative-plus-Alternative D conditions. Therefore, no portions of the redevelopment sites would be exposed to noise levels that exceed TRPA noise thresholds. This impact would be less than significant for purposes of TRPA threshold compliance.  Interior noise levels of these developments would be required to meet interior noise level standards pursuant to Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations. Common outdoor activity areas and outdoor activity areas of single family homes on these development sites would be subject to the City of South Lake Tahoe’s 60 CNEL standard presented in Table 3.15-5. According to the Noise Study Report, the 60 CNEL traffic noise contour would extend 304 feet from the centerline of the nearby segment of realigned US 50 (Caltrans 2015b:175). Thus, all of the sites would be located within the 60 CNEL traffic noise contour. If any outdoor activity areas were located within this distance without any intervening buildings or structures to provide noise protection, then they would be exposed to noise levels that exceed the noise standard established by the City of South Lake Tahoe. Moreover, traffic on local roadways could also contribute to noise on the sites (e.g., Lake Tahoe Boulevard west of Site 1A, Pioneer Trail that splits between Sites 1A and 1B, Heavenly Village Way north of Site 3). As a result, this would be a potentially significant impact for purposes of TRPA and CEQA. Conclusion For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into Alternative D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the potential to expose land uses to an incompatible noise environment. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential impacts related to the exposure of land uses to an incompatible noise environment as described above for the replacement housing for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the noise/land use compatibility impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E does not include the redevelopment of any areas within the project site. Therefore, Alternative E would not locate new noise-sensitive receptors where they would be exposed to noise levels that exceed applicable federal noises standards, TRPA noise thresholds or standards, or noise standards established by the local City or County. There would be no impact pertaining to the exposure of new land uses to excessive noise levels for purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  3.15.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures Mitigation Measure 3.15-1: Implement measures to reduce exposure of sensitive receptors to noise generated by nighttime construction activity The following noise abatement measures would apply for Alternative E only for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  The project proponent shall implement the following measures to reduce the level of construction noise exposure during the evening and nighttime hours between 6:30 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. The measures are in addition to the measures already required by TRPA’s Best Construction Practices Policy for the Minimization of Exposure to Construction-Generated Noise and Ground Vibration (TRPA [no date]a:6; TRPA [no date]b:4 to 5).  No noise-generating construction activity shall be performed at night unless necessary to minimize traffic conflicts.   Designate a disturbance coordinator and post that person’s telephone number conspicuously around all construction sites and provide to nearby residences. The disturbance coordinator shall receive all public complaints and be responsible for determining the cause of the complaint and implementing any feasible measures to alleviate the problem.  Provide advanced notice to owners of all residential land uses, tourist accommodations, and commercial land uses located within 1,110 feet where nighttime construction activity would take place. This noticing shall inform the recipients of when and where nighttime construction would occur and the types of measures being implemented to lessen the impact at potentially affected receptors. This noticing shall also provide the contact information for the designated disturbance coordinator.   Place temporary noise barriers or noise curtains as close to the noise source or receptor as possible such that it will break the line of sight between the source and receptor.  Coordinating with owners of all tourist accommodation units within this distance to limit nighttime construction activity during those times of year and days of the week when tourist occupancy is the lowest, to the extent feasible.   At equipment staging areas used to support nighttime construction activity, locate all equipment as far as possible from nearby noise-sensitive receptors. Temporary noise barriers shall be placed at these equipment staging areas to shield nearby noise-sensitive receptors from excessive noise generated at staging areas.   Prohibit backup alarms on all trucks and equipment used during nighttime activity and provide an alternate warning system, such as a flagman or radar-based alarm, which is compliant with state regulations. Alternatively, use back up alarms that are programed to generate noise levels no more than 10 dB louder than background noise levels.   Arrival of trucks hauling construction materials and equipment to staging areas and construction sites shall occur only between the hours of between 8:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. Departure of trucks hauling away debris from staging areas and construction sites shall also occur only between the hours of between 8:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. This requirement shall be provided to all haulers at the time of the initial hauling request.   Offer hotel accommodations to residents who would temporarily be exposed to interior noise levels that exceed the interior noise standard of 45 CNEL. Alternative overnight accommodations should be in a location that is not impacted by construction noise. Significance after Mitigation Implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.15-1 would reduce the level of noise exposure at receptors located near locations where nighttime construction activity would occur with Alternative E. However, it’s not certain that noise exposure levels would be reduced to less than the TRPA applicable land use-based CNEL thresholds. Because residents may refuse the offer of alternative overnight accommodations, they could still experience noise levels that would result in sleep disturbance. Therefore, this impact would be significant and unavoidable for Alternative E for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the construction of Alternative E to further reduce to the extend feasible the environmental consequences related to short-term construction noise.  Mitigation Measure 3.15-2a: Implement measures to reduce levels of ground vibration to limit the level of human annoyance  The following noise abatement measures would apply to the Alternative B, C, and D transportation improvements for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  The project proponent shall require the following measures be implemented for all pile driving activity, if required, related to construction of the pedestrian bridge:  All necessary piles shall be driven with sonic pile drivers instead of impact pile drivers;   To further reduce pile-driving ground vibration impacts, holes shall be predrilled to the maximum feasible depth. This would reduce the number of blows and/or the amount of time required to seat the pile, and would concentrate the pile-driving activity closer to the ground where noise can be attenuated more effectively;   Pile driving, earth moving, and ground-disturbance activities shall be phased so as not to occur simultaneously in areas close to off-site sensitive receptors. The total vibration level produced could be substantially less when each vibration source is operated separately; and  Designate a disturbance coordinator and post that person’s telephone number conspicuously around the locations where pile driving would be performed. The disturbance coordinator shall receive all public complaints and be responsible for determining the cause of the complaint and implementing any feasible measures to alleviate the problem. The contact information of the disturbance coordinator shall also be provided to the owners of all properties for which a pre-inspection survey is performed.  Mitigation Measure 3.15-2b: Implement measures to reduce exposure of buildings and other structures to levels of ground vibration that could result in structural damage and to limit the level of human annoyance The following noise abatement measures would apply for Alternative E only for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  The project proponent shall hire a qualified Nevada- and California-registered geotechnical engineer to perform site-specific study of the geotechnical conditions at the proposed skywalk site. The study shall determine the propagation rate of ground vibration in the area, taking into account local soil conditions, the age of the nearby buildings, and other factors. The study shall determine whether nearby structures and buildings could experience structural damage from pile driving activity at the skywalk site. The study shall also determine whether nearby residential dwellings, tourist accommodation units, and/or commercial land uses would experience levels of ground vibration that exceed FTA’s vibration standard of 80 VdB for human response.  The study shall also include a geotechnical inspection of all buildings and structures located within 100 feet of locations where impact pile driving would occur or within 60 feet where sonic pile driving would occur. The inspection shall document pre-existing conditions, including any pre-existing structural damage. The pre-inspection survey of the buildings shall be completed with the use of photographs, videotape, or visual inventory, and shall include inside and outside locations. All existing cracks in walls, floors, driveways shall be documented with sufficient detail for comparison during and upon completion of pile driving activities to determine whether new actual vibration damage has occurred. The results of both surveys shall be provided to the project proponent for review and acceptance of conclusions. Should damage occur during construction, construction operations shall be halted until the problem activity can be identified. Once identified, the problem activity shall be modified to eliminate the problem and protect the adjacent buildings. Any damage to nearby buildings shall be repaired back to the pre-existing condition at the expense of the project proponent. The study shall also identify site-specific measures to lessen the potential for structural damage and to reduce the potential for human response from ground vibration associated with construction of the skywalk and the project proponent shall require construction contractor(s) to implement the measures identified in the study. Such measures shall include, but are not limited to, the following:   All necessary piles shall be driven with sonic pile drivers instead of impact pile drivers, unless sonic pile driving is determined to be infeasible by a qualified geotechnical engineer;   To the extent feasible, project structures shall be designed so that impact-driven piles are placed a sufficient distance from nearby buildings and structures to minimize the potential to cause structural damage (e.g., 100 feet, assuming normal propagation conditions), and sonic-driven piles are placed at least 60 feet from nearby buildings and structures to minimize the potential to cause structural damage (e.g., 60 feet, assuming normal propagation conditions);   To the extent feasible, project structures shall be designed so that impact-driven piles are placed a sufficient distance from residences and tourist accommodation units to minimize human response (e.g., 300 feet, assuming normal propagation conditions), and sonic-driven piles are placed a sufficient distance from nearby buildings and structures to minimize human response (e.g., 175 feet, assuming normal propagation conditions);   To further reduce pile-driving ground vibration impacts, holes shall be predrilled to the maximum feasible depth. This would reduce the number of blows and/or the amount of time required to seat the pile, and would concentrate the pile-driving activity closer to the ground where noise can be attenuated more effectively;   Pile driving, earth moving, and ground-disturbance activities shall be phased so as not to occur simultaneously in areas close to off-site sensitive receptors. The total vibration level produced could be substantially less when each vibration source is operated separately;   Designate a disturbance coordinator and post that person’s telephone number conspicuously around the skywalk construction site and provide to nearby residences. The disturbance coordinator shall receive all public complaints and be responsible for determining the cause of the complaint and implementing any feasible measures to alleviate the problem. The contact information of the disturbance coordinator shall also be provided to the owners of all properties for which a pre-inspection survey is performed; and   Provide advanced notice to owners of all residential land uses, tourist accommodations, and commercial land uses located within 300 feet of where impact pile driving would take place or within 175 feet of where sonic pile driving would take place. This noticing shall inform the recipients of when and where pile driving would occur and the types of measures being implemented to lessen the impact at potentially affected receptors. This noticing shall also provide the contact information for the designated disturbance coordinator.  Significance after Mitigation With implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.15-2a, the level of construction-generated groundborne vibration experienced at nearby buildings for Alternatives B, C, and D would be reduced to less than FTA’s vibration standard of 80 VdB for human response at residential land uses. Therefore, implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.15-2a would reduce the ground vibration impact to a less-than-significant level for Alternatives B, C, and D for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. With implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.15-2b, the potential for groundborne vibration generated by pile driving at the skywalk site with Alternative E to result in structural damage to nearby buildings and structures and to adversely affect occupants of nearby residential dwellings and tourist accommodations units would be reduced. However, because pile driving would occur in close proximity to existing structures and buildings, it is not certain that the measures required by Mitigation Measure 3.15-2b would reduce ground vibration levels at nearby structures to less than FTA’s vibration standard of 0.20 in/sec PPV for structural damage. Moreover, because pile driving would occur in close proximity to existing residential dwellings, tourist accommodation units, and commercial land uses it is not certain that the measures required by Mitigation Measure 3.15-2b would reduce ground vibration at these receptors to levels less than FTA’s vibration standard for human response. Therefore, this impact would be significant and unavoidable with Alternative E for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, D, and E to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to ground vibration during construction. Mitigation Measure 3.15-3a: Implement traffic noise reduction measures to reduce traffic noise exposure at affected receptors The following noise abatement measures would apply to the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use redevelopment sites for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Performance Requirements Traffic noise reduction measures shall be implemented to achieve the following:  1. Ensure that Receptors 80, 88, 89, 90, and 91 are not exposed to an average daily traffic noise level that exceeds the land use-based 55 CNEL threshold established in TRPA’s Pioneer/Ski Run Plan Area Statement 092 (TRPA 2002c:3) and that Receptor 136 is not exposed to an average daily traffic noise level that exceeds the land use-based 65 CNEL threshold established in TRPA’s Tourist Core Area Plan (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2013:5-3 to 5-4) under cumulative conditions. These land use-based CNEL thresholds apply at all portions of these receptor parcels that are more than 300 feet from the edge of US 50. This performance requirement shall take priority over Performance Requirements 3 and 4;  2. TTD shall offer to retrofit the South Shore Inn (Receptor 55) sufficiently to ensure that its ambient interior noise levels do not exceed 45 CNEL with windows and doors closed. However, the owners of the motel may choose to refuse this offer;  3. To the extent feasible, reduce traffic noise levels at those receptors identified in Table 3.15-11 that would experience traffic noise levels that exceed or approach the applicable NAC and/or experience a traffic noise level increase greater than Caltrans’s incremental increase criterion of 12 dB. For NEPA purposes, the feasibility of achieving this performance requirement can be based on the Noise Abatement Decision Report prepared for the project (Caltrans 2016), which was prepared pursuant to guidance in Caltrans’s Traffic Noise Analysis Protocol for New Highway Construction and Reconstruction Projects (Caltrans 2011) and 23 CFR 772; and  4. To the extent feasible, reduce traffic noise levels at those receptors identified in Table 3.15-11 that would experience a traffic noise level that exceeds the applicable local noise standard (established by the City of South Lake Tahoe), and/or would experience a traffic noise level increase of 3 dB or greater. Noise Reduction Features Noise-reduction features may include, but are not limited to, any combination of the following:   Paving the nearby segment of roadway with rubberized hot-mix asphalt (RHMA) or equivalent surface treatment with known noise-reducing properties on top of the roadway surface. The RHMA overlay shall be designed with appropriate thickness and rubber component quantity (typically 15 percent by weight of the total blend), such that traffic noise levels are reduced by an average of 4 to 6 dB (noise levels vary depending on travel speeds, meteorological conditions, and pavement quality) as compared to noise levels generated by vehicle traffic traveling on standard asphalt. RHMA has been found to achieve this level of noise reduction in other parts of California (Sacramento County 1999). Pavement will require more frequent than normal maintenance and repair to maintain its noise attenuation effectiveness.   Installation of outdoor sound barriers between affected receptors and the roadway segments that are the predominant noise source at the receptors. The sound barriers must be constructed of solid material (e.g., wood, brick, adobe, an earthen berm, boulders, or combination thereof). The reflectivity of each sound barrier will be minimized to ensure that traffic noise reflected off the barrier does not contribute to an exceedance of applicable TRPA CNEL standards at other receptors. The level of sound reflection from a barrier can be minimized with a textured or absorptive surface or with vegetation on or next to the barrier. Scenic quality factors will be taken into account during design, such as using more natural materials (e.g., berms and boulders) to reduce the visible mass of a wall. Mitigation Measure 3.7-3 also proposes the use of a sound barrier to attenuate impacts from headlights shining onto residential properties and describes details to ensure the barriers would not cause negative visual impacts (see Section 3.7, “Visual Resources/Aesthetics”). All barriers will be designed to blend into the restored landscape along the highway, to the extent feasible. Ensuring a character consistent with the surrounding area may involve the use of strategically placed boulders, native trees, or other vegetation; the addition of special materials (e.g., wood or stonework) on the façade of the sound wall; and/or a sound wall that is covered in vegetation. The location and design of sound barriers shall adhere to any space requirements for snow removal on the adjacent roadway. If desired a sound barrier can be divided into two overlapping segments with a gap in the overlapped portion to provide pedestrian access from one side to the other.  The specific location, length, height, and design of noise barriers for Alternative B must be defined during engineering design development. It is not feasible to provide engineering details of noise barriers prior to the initiation of preliminary engineering for the transportation improvements. For conceptual planning purposes, however, based on the environmental planning-level noise analysis in this document, the approximate location and height of noise barriers for Alternative B are as follows:   Barriers would need to be built on both the north and south sides of the realigned US 50 alignment to protect affected residences behind them. The approximate length is estimated to be in the range of 1,000 to 1,200 feet on each side of the highway. The height needed for an approximately 5 dB attenuation would be between 6 to 8 feet above the road surface. Noise barriers would be entirely within the public right-of-way.  The conceptual extent of the south barrier would be from the intersection of realigned US 50 and Pioneer Trail (near the existing 90-degree bend in Primrose Road close to Pioneer Trail) east to the curve of the highway onto the Montreal Road alignment (near the existing intersection of Echo Road and Montreal Road).   The conceptual extent of the north barrier would be from the intersection of realigned US 50 and Pioneer Trail (near the existing intersection of Moss Road and Pioneer Trail) east to beyond Fern Road (near the existing corner of the back parking area of Heavenly Village Center).   Reduced vehicle speeds through posted speed limits, advisory signs, and/or design features that serve as traffic calming elements (e.g., median barrier, center islands, and raised crosswalks). The design of any special traffic-calming features shall not prevent the ability to provide adequate snow removal of any surfaces used for driving, walking, or biking.   Offer to the property owners of residences, motels/hotels, or other tourist accommodation units where the interior noise levels would exceed 45 CNEL, increased noise insulation of exterior walls to improve the Sound Transmission Class (STC) of those walls, including but not limited to added insulation, upgrades to drywall, acoustical sound absorption panels, new windows, and new exterior siding. For residences or tourist accommodation units that do not currently have air conditioning, install an air conditioning system if necessary to ensure that residents can close all windows and doors during nighttime hours and maintain adequate interior comfort.   Acquire properties where the noise level would exceed TRPA thresholds, applicable Caltrans noise abatement criteria, and/or applicable local noise standards; or where traffic noise levels would increase by 3 dB CNEL or greater. Acquisition of additional properties shall only occur if other feasible noise reduction measures are not available to achieve the applicable standards or minimize traffic noise increases to less than 3 dB CNEL. Selection and Design Process  The selection and design of specific traffic noise reduction measures shall be supported by a site-specific noise abatement assessment conducted by a qualified acoustical engineer or consultant selected by the project proponent. This study shall be fully funded by the project proponent and approved by the project proponent, TRPA, and Caltrans prior to project construction. If necessary to support the effectiveness of selected noise reduction measures, the site-specific noise abatement assessment may involve additional sound level measurements and/or the use of detailed site-specific modeling with software such as FHWA’s Traffic Noise Model (FHWA 2006), SoundPLAN (SoundPLAN 2015) or CadnaA (DataKustik 2015).  For those receptors predicted to experience an exceedance of NEPA significance criteria for traffic noise, as identified in Table 3.15-11, the feasibility of constructing a sound barrier, for NEPA purposes, shall be based on the results of the Noise Abatement Decision Report (Caltrans 2016), which was prepared pursuant to guidance in Caltrans’s Traffic Noise Analysis Protocol for New Highway Construction and Reconstruction Projects (Caltrans 2011) and 23 CFR 772.  TTD shall prepare a study supplemental to the Noise Abatement Decision Report to identify all necessary measures to ensure attainment of all applicable TRPA land use-based CNEL thresholds. The supplemental study shall also identify all feasible measures to reduce traffic noise increases to less than 3 dB and/or reduce traffic noise levels to less than the applicable local noise standards, with specific attention to the application of the City’s noise standard at the outdoor activity areas of residential and tourist accommodation land uses. In addition, the supplemental study shall identify, and TTD shall select, the set of feasible noise reduction measures that would benefit the most receptors and prioritize the attainment of applicable NAC ahead of the applicable local noise standard.  Significance after Mitigation Implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.15-3a would, at a minimum, ensure that receptors located more than 300 feet from the edge of US 50 would not be exposed to traffic noise levels that exceed applicable TRPA land use-based exterior CNEL thresholds. Based on the traffic noise modeling summarized in Table 3.15-11, this would be achieved with reductions of 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, and 3 dB at Receptors 80, 88, 89, 90, 91, and 136, respectively. A sound barrier that is just tall enough to break the line of sight between vehicles traveling on a roadway and ground level receptors results in at least 5 dB of noise reduction and can achieve an approximate 1 dB additional reduction for each 2 feet of height above where the sound barrier breaks the line of sight (with a maximum theoretical total reduction of 20 dB) (FHWA 2011:56). The use of RMHM typically provides a reduction of 4 to 6 dB compared to standard asphalt (Sacramento County 1999). Because the necessary reductions would be achievable through the use of sound barriers and/or RMHA, this impact would be reduced to less than the applicable TRPA land use-based noise thresholds. (Note: an illustration depicting the appearance of sound barriers is included as Exhibit 3.7-21 in Section 3.7, “Visual Resources/Aesthetics.” A discussion of the secondary visual effects of the barrier is also included following Mitigation Measure 3.7-3.) Providing additional noise insulation features to the South Shore Inn (Receptor 55) could ensure that interior noise levels at the motel would not exceed 45 CNEL with windows and doors closed. However, it is not certain that the property owner would accept this offer or that interior noise levels could be reduced to less than the 45 CNEL standard through implementation of off-site noise reduction measures alone (e.g., sound barriers, RHMA).  The Noise Abatement Decision Report determined that the estimated cost of constructing sound barriers to protect residential units from exposure to traffic noise levels that exceed applicable NEPA criteria with Alternative B would not be reasonable relative to the allowance of money per benefited residence for traffic noise abatement (Caltrans 2016:56). If funding for a sound barrier is not available from FHWA or Caltrans, then funding could be provided by TTD or other agencies.  It is also uncertain whether feasible traffic noise abatement measures could be implemented to ensure outdoor traffic noise levels at all receptors would be less than the applicable NAC and less than the applicable local exterior CNEL standard, and ensure traffic noise increases would be less than Caltrans’s incremental increase standard of 12 dB or even less than 3 dB, which is the TRPA significance criterion and the CEQA significance criterion used for receptors in California. Relatively large noise reductions would be needed at receptors located along both sides of the segment of realigned US 50 that would pass through the Rocky Point neighborhood; however, it may not be feasible to construct sound barriers along both sides of the highway that meet aesthetic and snow removal requirements and avoid measurable levels of noise reflection. Multiple receptors in this neighborhood would need noise abatement that achieves reductions of 10 dB or more. For instance, a 17-dB reduction would be needed at Receptor 73 on the north side of the highway and a 15-dB reduction would be needed at Receptor 50 on the south side of the same segment. Locating sound barriers along both sides of the highway could potentially result in a tunneling effect that exposes receptors located near the ends of the sound barriers to additional noise. Therefore, this impact in Alternative B would be significant and unavoidable for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into Alternative B to further reduce to the extend feasible the environmental consequences related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels.  Mitigation Measure 3.15-3b: Implement traffic noise reduction measures to reduce traffic noise exposure at affected receptors The following noise abatement measures would apply to the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Performance Requirements Traffic noise reduction measures shall be implemented to achieve the following:  1. Ensure that Receptor 136 is not exposed to an average daily traffic noise level that exceeds the land use-based 65 CNEL threshold established in TRPA’s Tourist Core Area Plan (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2013:5-3 to 5-4) under cumulative conditions. This performance requirement shall take priority over Performance Requirements 2, 3 and 4;  2. TTD shall offer to retrofit the South Shore Inn (Receptor 55) sufficiently to ensure that its ambient interior noise level does not exceed 45 CNEL with windows and doors closed. However, the owner of the motel may choose to refuse this offer;  3. To the extent feasible, reduce traffic noise levels at those receptors identified in Table 3.15-12 that would experience a traffic noise level that exceeds or approaches the applicable NAC and/or experience a traffic noise level increase greater than Caltrans’s incremental increase criterion of 12 dB. For NEPA purposes, the feasibility of achieving this performance requirement can be based on the Noise Abatement Decision Report prepared for the project (Caltrans 2016), which was prepared pursuant to guidance in Caltrans’s Traffic Noise Analysis Protocol for New Highway Construction and Reconstruction Projects (Caltrans 2011) and 23 CFR 772; and  4. To the extent feasible reduce traffic noise levels at those receptors identified in Table 3.15-12 that would experience a traffic noise level that exceeds the applicable local noise standard (established by the City of South Lake Tahoe), and/or would experience a traffic noise level increase of 3 dB or greater. Noise Reduction Features Noise reduction features may include, but are not limited to, the same features identified for Alternative B in Mitigation Measure 3.15-3a.  The specific location, length, height, and design of noise barriers for Alternative C must be defined during engineering design development and, as described for Alternative B, adhere to Mitigation Measure 3.7-3 to avoid negative visual impacts (see Section 3.7, “Visual Resources/Aesthetics”). It is not feasible to provide engineering details of noise barriers prior to the initiation of preliminary engineering for the transportation improvements. For conceptual planning purposes, however, based on the environmental planning-level noise analysis in this document, the approximate location and height of noise barriers for Alternative C are as follows (similar to Alternative B):   Barriers would need to be built on both the north and south sides of the realigned US 50 alignment to protect affected residences behind them. The approximate length is estimated to be in the range of 1,000 to 1,200 feet on each side of the highway. The height needed for an approximately 5 dB attenuation would be between 6 to 8 feet above the road surface. Noise barriers would be entirely within the public right-of-way.   The conceptual extent of the south barrier would be from the intersection of realigned US 50 and Pioneer Trail (near the existing 90-degree bend in Primrose Road close to Pioneer Trail) east to the curve of the highway onto the Montreal Road alignment (near the existing intersection of Echo Road and Montreal Road).   The conceptual extent of the north barrier would be from the intersection of realigned US 50 and Pioneer Trail (near the existing intersection of Moss Road and Pioneer Trail) east to beyond Fern Road (near the existing corner of the back parking area of Heavenly Village Center).  Selection and Design Process The selection and design of specific traffic noise reduction measures to reduce traffic noise impacts under Alternative C shall adhere to the same requirements identified for Alternative B in Mitigation Measure 3.15-5a.  Significance after Mitigation Implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.15-3b would, at a minimum, ensure that receptors located more than 300 feet from the edge of US 50 would not be exposed to traffic noise levels that exceed applicable TRPA land use-based exterior CNEL thresholds. Based on the traffic noise modeling summarized in Table 3.15-12, this would be achieved with a reduction of 2 dB at the Cedar Inn & Suites (Receptor 136). A sound barrier that is just tall enough to break the line of sight between vehicles traveling on a roadway and ground level receptors result in at least 5 dB of noise reduction and can achieve an approximate 1 dB additional reduction for each 2 feet of height above where the sound barrier breaks the line of sight (with a maximum theoretical total reduction of 20 dB) (FHWA 2011:56). The use of RMHM typically provides a reduction of 4 to 6 dB compared to standard asphalt (Sacramento County 1999). Because the necessary reductions would be achievable through the use of sound barriers and/or RMHA, this impact would be reduced to less than the applicable TRPA land use-based noise thresholds. (Note: an illustration depicting the appearance of sound barriers is included as Exhibit 3.7-21 in Section 3.7, “Visual Resources/ Aesthetics.” A discussion of the secondary visual effects of the barrier is also included following Mitigation Measure 3.7-3.) Providing additional noise insulation features to the South Shore Inn (Receptor 55) could ensure that interior noise levels at the motel would not exceed 45 CNEL with windows and doors closed. However, it is not certain that the property owner would accept this offer or that interior noise levels could be reduced to less than the 45 CNEL standard through implementation of off-site noise reduction measures alone (e.g., sound barriers, RHMA).  Based on the Noise Abatement Decision Report prepared for the project, Caltrans would incorporate noise abatement in the form of a barrier along the west side of US 50 between Fern Road and Echo Road, with a length of approximately 214 feet and average heights of 6 feet. Calculations based on preliminary design data show that this barrier would reduce noise levels by 5 to 7 dB for two residences at a cost of $134,820 (Caltrans 2016:56). If during final design conditions have substantially changed, noise abatement may not be necessary. The final decision of the noise abatement will be made upon completion of the project design. The Noise Abatement Decision Report determined that the estimated cost of constructing sound barriers at other locations to protect residential units from exposure to traffic noise levels that exceed applicable NEPA criteria with Alternative C would not be reasonable relative to the allowance of money per benefited residence for traffic noise abatement (Caltrans 2016:56). If funding for a sound barrier is not available from FHWA or Caltrans, then funding could be provided by TTD or other agencies.  It is also uncertain whether feasible traffic noise abatement measures could be implemented to ensure outdoor traffic noise levels at all receptors would be less than the applicable NAC and less than the applicable local CNEL standard, and ensure traffic noise increases would be less than Caltrans’s incremental increase standard of 12 dB or even less than 3 dB, which is the TRPA significance criterion and the CEQA significance criterion used for receptors in California. Relatively large noise reductions would be needed at receptors located along both sides of the segment of realigned east-bound US 50 that would pass through the Rocky Point neighborhood; however, it may not be feasible to construct sound barriers along both sides of the highway that meet aesthetic and snow removal requirements and avoid measurable levels of noise reflection. Multiple receptors in this neighborhood would need noise abatement that achieves reductions of 10 dB or more. For instance, a 13-dB reduction would be needed at Receptor 73 on the north side of the highway and an 11-dB reduction would be needed at Receptor 49 on the south side of the same segment. Locating sound barriers along both sides of the highway could potentially result in a tunneling effect that exposes receptors located near the ends of the sound barriers to additional noise. Therefore, this impact in Alternative C would be significant and unavoidable for the purposes CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into Alternative C to further reduce to the extend feasible the environmental consequences related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels.  Mitigation Measure 3.15-3c: Implement traffic noise reduction measures to reduce traffic noise exposure at affected receptors The following noise abatement measures would apply to the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Performance Requirements Traffic noise reduction measures shall be implemented to achieve the following:  1. Ensure that Receptors 30, 97, and 98 are not exposed to an average daily traffic noise level that exceeds the land use-based 55 CNEL threshold established in TRPA’s Pioneer/Ski Run Plan Area Statement 092 (TRPA 2002c:3) and that Receptor 136 is not exposed to an average daily traffic noise level that exceeds the land use-based 65 CNEL threshold established in TRPA’s Tourist Core Area Plan (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2013:5-3 to 5-4). These land use-based CNEL thresholds apply to all portions of these receptor parcels that are more than 300 feet from the edge of US 50. Also ensure that Receptor 29 is not exposed to more than its existing noise level of 65 CNEL under cumulative-plus-Alternative D conditions, which currently exceeds the TRPA land use-based noise threshold of 55 CNEL established in PAS 092 Pioneer/Ski Run (TRPA 2002c:3) and is expected to be exposed to 65 CNEL under cumulative-no-project conditions. This performance requirement shall take priority over Performance Requirements 2, 3, and 4;  2. TTD shall offer to retrofit the Trailhead Motel (Receptor 20) with sufficient noise insulation to ensure that its ambient interior noise levels do not exceed 45 CNEL with windows and doors closed. However, the owners of the motel may choose to refuse this offer;  3. To the extent feasible reduce traffic noise levels at Receptors 42, 68, 71, 83, and 84 so they would not experience a traffic noise level that exceeds or approaches the applicable NAC and/or experience a traffic noise level increase greater than Caltrans’s incremental increase criterion of 12 dB. For NEPA purposes, the feasibility of achieving this performance requirement can be based on the Noise Abatement Decision Report prepared for the project (Caltrans 2016), which was prepared pursuant to guidance in Caltrans’s Traffic Noise Analysis Protocol for New Highway Construction and Reconstruction Projects (Caltrans 2011) and 23 CFR 772 and is included in Appendix E to the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS; and  4. To the extent feasible reduce traffic noise levels at those receptors identified in Table 3.15-13 that would experience a traffic noise level that exceeds the applicable local noise standard established by the City of South Lake Tahoe, and/or would experience a traffic noise level increase greater than 3 dB. Noise Reduction Features Noise reduction features may include, but are not limited to, the same features identified for Alternative B in Mitigation Measure 3.15-3a.  Noise analysis indicates the need for a barrier on the south side of the relocated highway for Alternative D. The specific location, length, height, and design of noise barrier for Alternative D must be defined during engineering design development and, as described for Alternative B, adhere to Mitigation Measure 3.7-3 to avoid negative visual impacts (see Section 3.7, “Visual Resources/Aesthetics”). It is not feasible to provide engineering details of a noise barrier prior to the initiation of preliminary engineering for the transportation improvements. For conceptual planning purposes, however, based on the environmental planning-level noise analysis in this document, the approximate location and height of the noise barrier for Alternative D are as follows:   A barrier would need to be built on the south side of the realigned US 50 alignment to protect affected residences behind it. The approximate length is estimated to be in the range of 800 to 1,000 feet. The height needed for an approximately 5 dB attenuation would be between 6 to 8 feet above the road surface. The noise barrier would be entirely within the public right-of-way. The conceptual extent of the south barrier would be from the intersection of realigned US 50 and Pioneer Trail (near the existing intersection of Echo Road and Pioneer Trail) east to the curve of the highway onto the Montreal Road alignment (near the existing corner of the Heavenly Village Center parking lot).   If the existing residential land uses along Fern Road (represented by Receptors 96, 97, and 98) are not replaced with mixed-use redevelopment prior to completion of the realigned US 50 alignment, then a barrier would also need to be built on the north side of the realigned US 50 alignment to protect these affected residences. The approximate length of the barrier on the north side of the realigned US 50 alignment is estimated to be approximately 600 to 800 feet.  Selection and Design Process The selection and design of specific traffic noise reduction measures to reduce traffic noise impacts under Alternative D shall adhere to the same requirements identified for Alternative B in Mitigation Measure 3.15-5a.  Significance after Mitigation Implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.15-3c would, at a minimum, ensure that Receptors 30, 97, 98, and 136 would not be exposed to traffic noise levels that exceed applicable TRPA land use-based exterior CNEL thresholds. Based on the traffic noise modeling summarized in Table 3.15-13, this would be achieved with reductions of 3, 4, 5, and 3 dB at Receptors 30, 97, 98, and 136, respectively. Implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.15-5c would also ensure that the noise level at Receptor 29 would not exceed its existing noise level, requiring a reduction of 3 dB under cumulative-plus-Alternative D conditions. A sound barrier that is just tall enough to break the line of sight between vehicles traveling on a roadway and ground level receptors results in at least 5 dB of noise reduction and can achieve an approximate 1 dB additional reduction for each 2 feet of height above where the sound barrier breaks the line of sight (with a maximum theoretical total reduction of 20 dB) (FHWA 2011:56).

For instance, a 13-dB reduction would be needed at Receptor 83 on the south side of the highway and a 6-dB reduction would be needed at Receptor 98 on the north side of the same segment. Therefore, this impact in Alternative D would be significant and unavoidable for the purposes CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into Alternative D to further reduce to the extend feasible the environmental consequences related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels.  Mitigation Measure 3.15-3d: Implement traffic noise reduction measures to reduce traffic noise exposure at affected receptors  The following noise abatement measures would apply for Alternative E for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  Performance Requirements Traffic noise reduction measures shall be implemented to achieve the following:  1. Ensure that implementation of Alternative E does not contribute to an exceedance of the land use-based 65 CNEL threshold established in TRPA’s Tourist Core Area Plan (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2013:5-3 to 5-4) at Receptor 136 under cumulative conditions. This means that noise reduction measures shall be implemented to reduce the traffic noise level by a minimum of 1 dB under the cumulative-plus-Alternative E condition. (This performance requirement would also ensure that Alternative E does not contribute to an exceedance of the 65 CNEL transportation noise standard established by the City of South Lake Tahoe.) This performance requirement shall take priority over Performance Requirements 2 and 3;  2. Reduce exterior traffic noise levels at Receptors 20, 99, 102, 107, 135, and 136 by a minimum of 1 dB to offset the contribution by Alternative E under cumulative conditions to an exceedance of the 65 CNEL standard established by the City of South Lake Tahoe for these land uses; and 3. TTD shall offer to retrofit the Trailhead Motel (Receptor 20) and the Park Tahoe Aspen Court (Receptor 107) sufficiently to ensure that its ambient interior noise levels do not exceed 45 CNEL with windows and doors closed. However, the owners of these motels may choose to refuse this offer. Noise Reduction Features Noise reduction features may include, but are not limited to, the same features identified for Alternative B in Mitigation Measure 3.15-3a.  Selection and Design Process The selection and design of specific traffic noise reduction measures to reduce traffic noise impacts under Alternative E shall adhere to the same requirements identified for Alternative B in Mitigation Measure 3.15-5a.  Significance after Mitigation Implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.15-3d would ensure that Alternative E would not contribute to the exceedance of the land use-based 65 CNEL threshold established in TRPA’s Tourist Core Area Plan (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2013:5-3 to 5-4) at Receptor 136 under cumulative conditions. It would also ensure that Alternative E would not contribute to the exceedance of the 65 CNEL threshold established by the City of South Lake Tahoe at Receptors 20, 99, 102, 107, 135, and 136, and ensure that Alternative E would not contribute to the exceedance of the 45 CNEL interior noise standard at the Trailhead Motel (Receptor 20) and the Park Tahoe Aspen Court (Receptor 107). Based on the traffic noise modeling summarized in Table 3.15-14, this would be achieved with a reduction of 1 dB. Even if there may not be room on the public right of way to construct a new sound barrier, or a property owner does not agree to provide adequate space to locate a sound barrier, or a property owner of the Trailhead Motel (Receptor 20) and/or the Park Tahoe Aspen Court (Receptor 107) does not allow building retrofits, the resurfacing of the nearby roadway segment with RMHA would provide a noise reduction of 4 to 6 dB compared to standard asphalt (Sacramento County 1999). Because the necessary 1 dB reduction would be achievable at all impacted receptors through the use of RMHA, this impact in Alternative E would be reduced to less than significant for the purposes of TRPA and CEQA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into Alternative E to further reduce to the extend feasible the environmental consequences related to the exposure of sensitive receptors to increased traffic noise levels. Mitigation Measure 3.15-4: Implement noise protection measures to ensure that outdoor activity areas on the mixed-use redevelopment sites are not exposed to noise levels greater than 60 CNEL The following noise abatement measures would apply to the Alternative B, C, and D mixed-use development sites for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Performance Requirement Developers of each mixed-use redevelopment site shall be required to ensure that ambient traffic noise levels do not exceed 60 CNEL at all common outdoor activity areas (not including parking lots or walkways between parking lots and building entrances). This performance standard shall be achieved at each site prior to occupancy of any of the housing units and under the cumulative-plus-project condition for Alternatives B, C, and D.  Noise Reduction Features Measures to reduce noise exposure levels may include, but are not limited to, any combination of the following:   Setting back common outdoor activity areas as far as possible from the nearest segment(s) of US 50;   Strategically locating buildings to shield common outdoor activity areas from noise generated by traffic on the nearby segment(s) of US 50. An example of this type of design layout exists at the existing Forest Suites Resort on the corner of Lake Parkway and Heavenly Village Way;   Installing outdoor sound barriers on the redevelopment property between the outdoor activity areas and the nearby segment(s) of US 50. The sound barriers must be constructed of solid material (e.g., wood, brick, adobe, an earthen berm, boulders, or combination thereof). The reflectivity of each sound barrier shall be minimized to ensure that traffic noise reflected off the barrier does not contribute to an exceedance of applicable noise standards at other off-site receptors. The level of sound reflection from a barrier can be minimized with a textured or absorptive surface or with vegetation on or next to the barrier. All barriers shall blend into the overall landscape and have an aesthetically pleasing appearance that agrees with the character of the surrounding area, and not become the dominant visual element of the area. Ensuring a character consistent with the surrounding area may involve the use of strategically placed boulders, native trees, or other vegetation; the addition of special materials (e.g., wood or stonework) on the façade of a sound wall; and/or a sound wall that is covered in vegetation. Special icon panels depicting works of art or emblems meaningful to the area may be included on sound barriers so long as they comply with any applicable local guidelines for public art. The location and design of sound barriers shall adhere to any space requirements for snow removal on US 50. Where desired a sound barrier can be divided into two overlapping segments with a gap to provide pedestrian access from one side to the other; and/or  Locating outdoor activity areas, such as swimming pools or patios, on building rooftops.  Selection and Design Process  The selection and design of specific measures to reduce noise exposure at outdoor activity areas at each mixed-use redevelopment site shall be conducted by a qualified acoustical engineer or consultant pursuant to Policy HS-8.6 of the City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan. The study for each site shall be fully funded by the applicant seeking to develop the site and approved by City staff prior to project construction. If necessary to support the effectiveness of selected noise reduction measures, the site-specific noise abatement assessment may involve additional sound level measurements and/or the use of detailed site-specific modeling with software such as FHWA’s Traffic Noise Model (FHWA 2006), SoundPLAN (SoundPLAN 2015) or CadnaA (DataKustik 2015).  Significance after Mitigation Implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.15-4 would ensure that all common outdoor activity areas and the outdoor activity areas developed on the redevelopment sites would not be exposed to traffic noise levels that exceed 60 CNEL. For each doubling of the setback distance between a roadway and an outdoor activity area, the level of traffic noise exposure from that roadway is reduced by 3 to 4.5 dB depending on the acoustical softness of the intervening land (Caltrans 2013a:2-29). A sound barrier that is just tall enough to break the line of sight between vehicles traveling on a roadway and ground level receptors results in at least 5 dB of noise reduction and can achieve an approximate 1 dB additional reduction for each 2 feet of height above where the sound barrier breaks the line of sight (with a maximum theoretical total reduction of 20 dB) (FHWA 2011:56). Multiple-story buildings strategically located to shield outdoor activity areas from highway noise can result in 3-10 dB of noise reduction depending on the building sizes, spacing of buildings, and site geometry (Caltrans 2013a:2-35). Because the necessary reductions would be achievable through these design measures in Alternatives B, C, and D, this impact would be reduced to less than significant for purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purpose of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D to further reduce to the extend feasible the environmental consequences related to the potential to expose land uses to an incompatible noise environment.     This page intentionally left blank.  3.16 BIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT This section summarizes the common and sensitive vegetation, terrestrial wildlife, and aquatic biological resources that are known or have the potential to occur in the project site. Biological resources include common vegetation and habitat types, sensitive plant communities, and special-status plant and animal species. Federal, TRPA, state, and local regulations related to biological resources are summarized. Potential impacts of the proposed alternatives are analyzed, and mitigation measures are provided for those impacts determined to be significant. Cumulative biological resources impacts are addressed in Section 3.19, “Cumulative Impacts.” The primary issues raised during scoping that pertain to biological resources included:  Project-related disturbances to a stream environment zone and the need for mitigation.   Potential effects of additional lighting and noise on wildlife, particularly near Van Sickle Bi-State Park. For this analysis, information about common and sensitive biological resources known or with potential to occur within the project site boundaries is based primarily on reconnaissance surveys conducted by Ascent biologists and available data sources. Sources consulted consist of the following: US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project Natural Environment Study (NES; TTD 2015); Tree Survey for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project memorandum (Ascent Environmental 2014) (Appendix L); Section 3.10, “Biological Resources,” of the Regional Plan Update Environmental Impact Statement (RPU EIS) and Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan (RTP, also known as Mobility 2035) and Sustainable Communities Strategy Environmental Impact Report and Environmental Impact Statement (RTP/SCS EIR/EIS); Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) survey and GIS data; a records search of the California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB 2015); California Native Plant Society Online Inventory of Rare and Endangered Plants (CNPS 2015); a database search of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Information, Planning, and Conservation System (IPaC) and a list of federally proposed, candidate, threatened, and endangered species that may occur in the project region (USFWS 2016); USFS Region 5 EVeg land cover data (U.S. Forest Service [USFS] 2014); and high resolution aerial imagery. Although the draft 2017 RTP has been released for public review, and includes the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project, the 2012 RTP/SCS is the currently adopted plan. Because an initial study/initial environmental checklist (IS/IEC) has been prepared for the 2017 RTP as a supplement to the 2012 RTP/SCS EIR/EIS and does not result in new significant environmental impacts, the analysis below continues to rely on that EIR/EIS. None of the build alternatives evaluated herein would be constructed within an area covered by an adopted Habitat Conservation Plan, Natural Community Conservation Plan, or other approved local, regional, or state conservation plan. Therefore, project implementation would not conflict with the provisions of an adopted conservation plan and this issue is not evaluated further. Section 3.16.2, “Affected Environment,” discusses the special-status plant and animal species evaluated in this analysis, and Tables M-1 and M-2 in Appendix M summarize the potential for each of these species to occur in the project site. Generally, those plant and animal species not expected to occur, or with a low probability to occur (because of a lack of suitable habitat, existing disturbance levels, or lack of occurrence records) are not addressed further in this analysis. Implementation of the proposed build alternatives would have no effect on those species, including any species listed, proposed for listing, or designated as a candidate for listing under the federal Endangered Species Act. Additionally, the project site is not positioned within any known important wildlife movement or migratory corridors. Because the project site is subject to high levels of human disturbance and isolation of habitat patches because of commercial and residential development, presence of major road corridors, and recreational uses, it is not likely to function as an important corridor and this issue is not addressed further.  Potential effects of construction-related noise, changes in traffic noise levels, and changes in nighttime lighting conditions on wildlife with all of the build alternatives were considered. Effects of noise and lighting on wildlife species depend on the specific type, location, and context of noise and lighting sources, and the sensitivity of specific wildlife species to variation in noise and lighting levels. All of the build alternatives would be implemented within major road corridors and commercial/residential areas that are presently subject to substantial noise levels, nighttime lighting, and other disturbances. The introduction of a new source of light during nighttime hours in these urban settings would not substantially alter the amount of illumination in the study area, recognizing the existing night lighting of roadways, parking lots, and commercial areas. Additionally, as described later in this section, no special-status wildlife species are expected to regularly use or occur within or adjacent to the project site due to the disturbed habitat conditions there. Wildlife species that regularly use habitats within and adjacent to the project site are locally and regionally common, and adapted to urban environments or other disturbed areas subject to considerable noise and light levels. Therefore, project-related changes in noise and nighttime lighting relative to ambient levels are not expected to substantially affect the presence or abundance of wildlife species, and this issue is not addressed further. 3.16.1 Regulatory Setting Biological resources in the Tahoe Basin are regulated by several federal, state, and local laws and policies. Key regulations and conservation planning issues applicable to the project are summarized below. FEDERAL The following federal regulations described in the RPU EIS and RTP/SCS EIR/EIS are applicable to the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project. They are described in detail in the two, program-level environmental documents and have not changed since these documents were published.

The Regional Plan includes the Goals and Policies, Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities (threshold standards), Code of Ordinances, and other guidance documents. These elements of the Regional Plan that are related to biological resources and applicable to the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project are described in Section 3.10.1, “Regulatory Background,” of Section 3.10, “Biological Resources,” of the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS (TMPO and TRPA 2012:3.10-1 through 3.10-8) and the RPU EIS (TRPA 2012:3.10-1 through 3.10-8), and are incorporated by reference.  STATE The following state laws and regulations are described in Section 3.10.1, “Regulatory Background,” of Section 3.10, “Biological Resources,” of the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS (TMPO and TRPA 2012:3.10-11 through 3.10-13) and the RPU EIS (TRPA 2012:3.10-10 through 3.10-12), and are incorporated by reference:  California Endangered Species Act (CESA)  California Fish and Game Code Section 1602—Streambed Alteration  California Fish and Game Code Sections 3503–3503.5—Protection of Bird Nests and Raptors  California Native Plant Protection Act  Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act  Z’Berg-Nejedly Forest Practice Act  Nevada Administrative Code 527.010 and Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 527.260, NRS 527.270, and  NRS 527.300  Nevada Revised States, Title 45  Nevada Revised Statutes 503.610 and 503.620 LOCAL City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan The City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan (City of South Lake Tahoe 2011) includes goals and policies to protect biological resources within the city. Policies NCR-3.1 through NCR-3.16 address the conservation and protection of natural habitats and open space, sensitive species, stream environment zones, native trees, and other biological resources.  Douglas County Master Plan The Douglas County Master Plan Environmental Resources and Conservation (ERC) Element describes goals, policies, and actions to protect the natural resources of Douglas County (Douglas County 2011). ERC Policies 6.1 through 6.3 were enacted to protect wetland resources and specify compliance with the CWA, the possibility of wetland mitigation banking, and the protection of wetlands for groundwater discharge, flood protection, sediment and pollution control, wildlife habitat, and open space. ERC Policies 14.1 through 14.3 address the protection of sensitive wildlife, vegetation, and habitats through limitations on development or mitigation. ERC Action 14.1 directs the County to develop regulations and design guidelines to minimize impacts of new development on sensitive habitats and migration routes. 3.16.2 Affected Environment The following sections summarize the biological resources in the study area that are most relevant to the significance criteria and impact analysis for the project, which are provided in Section 3.16.3, “Environmental Consequences.”  LAND COVER AND HABITAT TYPES Land cover within the project site consists of a mix of primarily developed and urban areas (80 percent of the total area) interspersed with patches of natural habitats, including Jeffrey pine, low sagebrush, montane riparian, and montane meadow. Table 3.16-1 summarizes the vegetation/land cover types mapped within the project site, their estimated acreages, and biological conditions. Exhibit 3.16-1 shows the corresponding location and extent of land cover types within the project site as mapped during project surveys. SENSITIVE BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES In this analysis, sensitive biological resources include those species and biological communities that receive special consideration through the TRPA Goals and Polices and TRPA Code, ESA, CESA, CWA, or local plans, policies, and regulations; or that are otherwise considered sensitive by federal, state, or local resource conservation agencies and organizations. Sensitive biological resources evaluated as part of this analysis include sensitive natural communities and special-status plant and animal species. These resources are addressed in the following sections. Sensitive Natural Communities and Habitats Sensitive habitats include those that are of special concern to resource agencies or are afforded specific consideration through the TRPA Goals and Policies and TRPA Code, Section 404 of the CWA, and other applicable regulations. Sensitive natural habitats may be of special concern to these agencies and conservation organizations for a variety of reasons, including their locally or regionally declining status, or because they provide important habitat to common and special-status species. For the California side of the Tahoe Basin, many of these communities are tracked in the CNDDB. Sensitive natural communities and habitats in the project site are montane riparian, montane meadow, perennial stream, and intermittent and ephemeral drainages. Streams and drainages in the project site are Edgewood Creek (perennial stream), Golf Course Creek (intermittent drainage), and Stateline Creek (ephemeral drainage); these features are described in Section 3.9, “Floodplains.” The NES prepared for the project (TTD 2015) identified several potential wetlands and other waters of the United States within the project site, based on a preliminary wetland delineation conducted in 2010 and 2011. The largest of these are two features located around Golf Course Creek on either side of its intersection with Lake Parkway. Another small potential wetland was mapped on the margins of Edgewood Creek at its intersection with US 50. The remaining potential wetlands are associated with roadside drainages along Lake Parkway and US 50. In total, 0.89 acre of potential wetlands and 0.09 acre of non-wetland waters were identified within the project site.  Most of the wetland/riparian habitats would likely be considered jurisdictional by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and, in California, the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board (Lahontan RWQCB) under Section 404 of the federal CWA and the state’s Porter-Cologne Act. In addition, on the California side of the Tahoe Basin, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) has jurisdiction over activities affecting the bed and bank of drainages. Additionally, habitats consisting of deciduous trees, wetlands, and meadows (i.e., riparian, wetland, and meadow habitats) are designated by TRPA as habitats of special significance. The TRPA threshold standard for habitats of special significance is non-degradation while providing for opportunities to increase the acreage of these habitats. Most of the areas within wetland/riparian habitats in the Tahoe Basin are also designated as stream environment zone (SEZ), which is one of two TRPA-adopted threshold standards for soil conservation. SEZ is a term used specifically in the Tahoe Basin to describe perennial, intermittent and ephemeral streams; wet meadows, marshes, and other wetlands; riparian areas; and other areas expressing the presence of surface and ground water through its biological and physical characteristics.    Table 3.16-1 Land Cover and Habitat Types Mapped in the Project Site  Vegetation Community/ Habitat Type  Summary Description  Acres in Project Site  Natural Habitats      Jeffrey Pine  Jeffrey pine forest is the dominant natural vegetation type in the project site, and primarily occurs along Lake Parkway in the eastern portion of the project site. Open forest community clearly dominated (80-85 percent) by Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) but with 10-15 percent white fir (Abies concolor) and occasional lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens). Canopy cover is generally open as Jeffrey pine tends to be more scattered throughout the community. This allows for the understory of the Jeffrey pine forest to contain plants requiring drier, sunnier conditions than in other conifer communities. These understory plants include mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata var. vaseyana), bitterbrush (Persia tridentata), rubber rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus nauseosus), Wood’s rose (Rosa woodsii), Greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula), mule ears (Wyethia mollis), and Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis).   15.0  Low Sagebrush  Consists of soft-woody shrubs dominated by low sagebrush (Artemisia arbuscula) and mountain big sagebrush. Rubber rabbitbrush and bitterbrush are the most common associates of this community in the project site. Scattered Jeffrey pine can also be found associated within this community. Common species in the herbaceous understory include lupines (Lupinus sp.), mule ears, and a variety of grasses. This community occurs within the eastern portion of the project site, north of Van Sickle Bi-State Park.   1.5  Montane Meadow  Montane meadow habitat within the project site consists of both wetlands and upland components. Wet meadows in the project site have seasonally saturated soils with hydrology supported by toe-slope seeps and seasonal or intermittent streams. The majority of montane meadow is located in the northeast portion of the project site along Lake Parkway; a few small areas of seasonal wetlands were identified in this area but most of this area of montane meadow is upland. The largest wet meadow community (Friday’s Station meadow) was historically used for livestock grazing and appears to have been seeded with non-native forage grasses in the past. Portions of this meadow have been significantly disturbed. A small wetland area of montane meadow is located adjacent to the parking lot for Harrah’s resort-casino. The meadow is supported by a drainage that originates on the east side of Lake Parkway and flows beneath the road via a culvert. Of the 4.44 acres of montane meadow in the project site, 0.39 acre is wetland. The montane meadow habitat consists of a wide variety of grasses and forbs adapted for growth in saturated soils. Herbaceous hydrophytes include sedges (Carex amplifolia, Carex aquatilis), creeping spikerush (Eleocharis macrostachya), corn lily (Veratrum californicum var. californicum), and Oregon checkerbloom (Sidlacea oregano spicata). Lemmon’s willow (Salix lemmonii) was also present in the wettest portion of the meadow in the northeast portion of the project site along Lake Parkway.  6.5  Montane Riparian  Montane riparian habitat is located along Edgewood Creek, Stateline Creek, and Golf Course Creek, and in association with wet meadows, intermittent drainages, and toe-slope seeps in the eastern part of the project site. The montane riparian communities within in the project site generally consist of dense willow (Salix sp.) and mountain alder (Alnus incana ssp. tenuifolia), with or without flowing water. The predominant overstory species included Lemmon’s willow, arroyo willow (Salix lasiolepis) and mountain alder; quaking aspen, and white fir are also present. Representative woody understory species include mountain rose (Rosa woodsii var. ultriamontana), serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia var. pumila), and sapling overstory species. Common herbaceous species include sedges, baltic rush (Juncus balticus), and common horsetail (Equisetum arvense).  2.8  Non-Natural/Urban Habitats  Developed  A developed landscape dominated by commercial uses. Vegetation is generally confined to ornamental plantings and landscaping.  68.4  Ruderal  Ruderal vegetation occurs in areas that have been disturbed by human activities such that natural communities no longer exist. In the project site, ruderal vegetation typically occurs along road shoulders or adjacent areas; ruderal vegetation also occurs in two detention basins near the junction of Pioneer Trail and US 50 and on the California Tahoe Conservancy (Conservancy) parcel between Forest Suites Resort and the Harrah’s resort-casino parking lot. Plant species occurring in ruderal areas include cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), ripgut brome (Bromus diandrus), shield cress (Lepidium perfoliatum), bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare), prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola), field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense), and common plantain (Plantago major).  14.3  Urban Jeffrey Pine  Urban Jeffrey pine habitat is located in the southern portion of the project site near Pioneer Trail. This community consists of single-family residences and similar developed areas where the understory component of the Jeffrey pine community has been eliminated but the overstory component (i.e., Jeffrey pine trees) is mostly intact.   21.6  Source: TTD 2015, data compiled by Ascent Environmental in 2015      Exhibit 3.16-1 Land Cover/Habitat Types Within the Project Site   Special-Status Species Special-status species include plants and animals that are legally protected or otherwise considered sensitive by federal, state, or local resource agencies and conservation organizations. Special-status species are defined as plants and animals in the following categories.   Listed or proposed for listing as threatened or endangered under ESA.  Designated as a candidate for listing as threatened or endangered under ESA.  Designated as a sensitive, special-interest, or threshold species by TRPA.  Designated as sensitive by the USFS Regional Forester in Region 5.  Listed or proposed for listing as threatened or endangered under CESA.  Listed or a candidate for listing by the state of California as threatened or endangered under CESA.  Listed as fully protected under the California Fish and Game Code.  Animals identified by CDFW as species of special concern.  Plants considered by CDFW to be “rare, threatened or endangered in California” (California Rare Plant Ranks [CRPR] of 1A, presumed extinct in California; 1B, considered rare or endangered in California and elsewhere; and 2, considered rare or endangered in California but more common elsewhere). The California Rare Plant Ranks correspond with and replace former CNPS listings. While these rankings do not afford the same type of legal protection as ESA or CESA, the uniqueness of these species requires special consideration under CEQA.   Considered a locally significant species, that is, a species that is not rare from a statewide perspective but is rare or uncommon in a local context such as within a county or region (CEQA Guidelines Section 15125 [c]) or is so designated in local or regional plans, policies, or ordinances (State CEQA Guidelines, Appendix G).   Otherwise meets the definition of rare or endangered under CEQA Guidelines Section 15380(b) and (d).   Plant species on Nevada’s state list of fully-protected species of native flora (Nevada Administrative Code, Section 527.010), also known as the Critically Endangered Species List.  Designated as an At-Risk Species by the Nevada Natural Heritage Program (NNHP).  A preliminary list of special-status plant and animal species known or with potential to occur in the project site was developed based on a review of the sources listed at the beginning of this section.  Plants The data review identified 49 special-status plant species that could occur in or near the project site. Table M-1 (Appendix M) summarizes the regulatory status, habitat and flowering period, and potential for occurrence in the project site of each special-status plant species evaluated during this analysis. No special-status plant species were observed during focused plant surveys conducted in 2010 by LSA Associates (TTD 2015), and none of the species identified in the data review have a moderate or high potential to exist in the project site (i.e., they have low or no potential to occur), because of a lack of suitable habitat, existing disturbance levels, lack of occurrence records, or the species’ elevational range is outside the project site. Additionally, natural vegetation communities in the project site that may otherwise provide potential habitat for some special-status plant species are not expected to, because those areas are subject to high levels of human disturbance, degradation, and isolation of habitat patches due to commercial and residential development, presence of major road corridors, and recreational uses. Therefore, no special-status plant species, including species listed under the ESA, are expected to occur in the project site. The project would not affect any plant species listed, proposed for listing, or designated as a candidate for listing under the ESA.  Animals The data review identified 39 special-status animal species and two special-status fish species that could occur in or near the project site. Table M-2 (Appendix M) summarizes the potential for occurrence of each special-status animal species that was evaluated during this analysis. Of these species, none are expected to occur or regularly use the project site. This determination was based on the types, extent, and quality of habitats in the project site; the proximity of the project site to known occurrences of the species; and the regional distribution and abundance of the species. Additionally, natural vegetation communities in the project site that may otherwise provide potential habitat for some special-status animal species are not expected, for the same reasons discussed previously for special-status plants. Therefore, no special-status animal species are expected to regularly use or occur in the project site. The project would not affect any animal species listed, proposed for listing, or designated as a candidate for listing under the ESA. 3.16.3 Environmental Consequences METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS The analysis of potential impacts to biological resources from project implementation is based on the data review and resource mapping, project-specific biological surveys, and technical studies described previously. The following summarizes the impact mechanisms and assumptions considered for this analysis, and how potential impacts were evaluated for the project alternatives.  Primary Impact Mechanisms and Assumptions Potential impacts associated with the project can be classified as either temporary or permanent. Temporary impacts generally include ground disturbances associated with temporary construction activities, including:  construction staging,  minor cut and fill that would be restored to existing conditions after project completion,   potential construction disturbances assumed to occur within 10 feet of permanent project features, and  noise, ground vibration, and airborne particulate (dust) generated by construction activities. Permanent impacts generally include effects associated with permanent tree or other vegetation removal as a result of:  earthwork/excavation;  new paving for bridge, roadway, bike path, and parking facilities;  cut and fill that changes the existing ground elevation;  landscaping; and  installation of bridge footings. The following summarizes the methodology for determining potential impacts on vegetation, wildlife, and aquatic resources, including key assumptions about their relative effects.  Vegetation and Wildlife Potential impacts of each build alternative on vegetation and wildlife resources were initially identified by overlaying GIS layers of project components on the land cover maps of the project site and maps of sensitive biological resources. Any natural community and wildlife habitat that overlapped with an area of proposed modification was considered to be directly removed during project construction. An estimate of the amount of vegetation removal planned for the clearing of work areas and access ways was determined. Short-term construction impacts would occur where natural vegetation would be removed to construct new features and facilities or modify existing features. Construction-related impacts could also indirectly affect biological resources through stormwater runoff, erosion, and the introduction of invasive or non-native species. Long-term impacts to biological resources would occur in or adjacent to habitats that would experience a permanent conversion in land use and cover (i.e., conversion of natural vegetation to paved areas, other facilities, and landscaping).  No substantial changes in biological resources would occur as a result of modified public uses (e.g., recreation opportunities, commercial uses). The project site is located within the tourist core area of the state line and currently experiences high levels of public use and other human activity.  Special-Status Species Impacts to plant and animal species could occur either through temporary or permanent habitat loss, disturbance of normal activity or dispersal patterns, or through direct mortality. Potential impacts to sensitive species were determined by analyzing species life history requirements and known occurrences or potential to occur in the project site.  Section 3.16.2, “Affected Environment,” discusses all special-status plant and animal species evaluated in this analysis, and Tables M-1 and M-2 (Appendix M) summarize the potential for each of these species to occur in the project site. As discussed previously, no special-status plant species is expected to occur in the project site, and no special-status animal is expected to occur or regularly use the project site. As discussed previously, for species listed, proposed for listing, or designated as a candidate for listing under the ESA, project implementation would result in no effect. Therefore, the project is not expected to substantially affect any special-status species, and the following analysis does not further address special-status species.  Aquatic Resources Potential impacts of each build alternative on aquatic resources (e.g., streams and drainages) were identified by overlaying GIS layers of project alternative components on aquatic habitats. Impacts to aquatic resources were determined by the proximity of these resources to project work areas, taking into account the construction needs within those areas. Hydrologic and flow characteristics and vegetation were also considered. SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA Significance criteria relevant to biological resources are summarized below. NEPA Criteria An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the locally preferred action. Under NEPA, the significance of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. Under NEPA, the context and intensity of an alternative’s potential effect on biological resources were evaluated based on whether the alternative would:  substantially reduce the size, continuity, or integrity of a plant community through temporary or permanent removal, interruption of natural processes that support it, and/or disturbance that favors the establishment of invasive nonnative species; or  substantially reduce the size, continuity, or integrity of wildlife or fish habitat, or result in unnatural changes in the abundance, diversity, or distribution of wildlife or fish species; substantially affect, either directly or through habitat modifications, any species listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or other special-status species.  TRPA Criteria Vegetation and wildlife criteria from the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist were used to evaluate the biological resources impacts of the alternatives. The project would result in a significant impact if it would result in:  removal of riparian vegetation or other vegetation associated with critical wildlife habitat, either through direct removal or indirect lowering of the groundwater table;  removal of stream bank and/or backshore vegetation, including woody vegetation such as willows;  introduction of new vegetation that will require excessive fertilizer or water, or will provide a barrier to the normal replenishment of existing species;  removal of any native live, dead, or dying trees 30 inches or greater in diameter at breast height (dbh) within TRPA’s Conservation or Recreation land use classifications;  introduction of new species of animals into an area, or result in a barrier to the migration or movement of animals;  change in the diversity or distribution of species, or number of any species of plants or animals;  reduction of the numbers of any unique, rare, or endangered species of plants or animals;  a change in the natural functioning of an old growth ecosystem; or  deterioration of existing fish or wildlife habitat quantity or quality. CEQA Criteria Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines was used to determine whether environmental impacts to biological resources are significant environmental effects. The project would result in a significant impact if it would:   have a substantial adverse effect on any riparian habitat or other sensitive natural community identified in local or regional plans, policies, or regulations, or by CDFW, USFWS, or USACE;  have a substantial adverse effect on federal or state protected wetlands as defined by Section 404 of the CWA or as defined by state statute, through direct removal, filling, hydrological interruption, or other means;  have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or through habitat modifications, on any species identified as a candidate, sensitive, or special-status species in local or regional plans, policies, or regulations, or by CDFW or USFWS;  substantially reduce the habitat of a fish or wildlife species, cause a fish or wildlife population to drop below self-sustaining levels, threaten to eliminate a plant or animal community, substantially reduce the number or restrict the range (i.e., geographic distribution) of an endangered, rare, or threatened species;   interfere substantially with the movement of any native resident or migratory fish or wildlife species or with established native resident or migratory wildlife corridors, or impede the use of native wildlife nursery sites; or  conflict with any local policies or ordinances that protect biological resources, such as a tree preservation policy or ordinance. ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF THE PROJECT ALTERNATIVES Impact 3.16-1: Disturbance or loss of common vegetation communities and wildlife habitats With three of the build alternatives (Alternatives B, C, and D), project implementation would result in the removal or disturbance of 0.5 to 1.7 acres of common natural vegetation communities and habitats, including Jeffrey pine and low sagebrush. Because these habitats are locally and regionally common and abundant, and the project site is presently affected by high levels of commercial/urban, residential, and recreational uses, none of these build alternatives would substantially reduce the size, continuity, or integrity of any common vegetation community or habitat type. With the no-build alternative (Alternative A) or Alternative E, no project-related removal of common vegetation communities would occur. NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternative B, C, and D would avoid or minimize the disturbance or loss of common vegetation communities and wildlife habitats; No Impact for Alternatives A and E CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations: Less than Significant for Alternatives B, C, and D; No Impact for Alternatives A and E With Alternatives B, C, and D, Jeffrey pine and low sagebrush are the common native vegetation and habitat types that would be directly removed or temporarily disturbed primarily from project construction. (Impacts on sensitive habitats are addressed separately below.) Table 3.16-2 summarizes permanent and temporary effects on common vegetation for each build alternative.  Table 3.16-2 Acreage of Permanent and Temporary Footprints within Common Vegetation Community/ Habitat Types  Vegetation Community/Habitat Type  Alternative B  Alternative C  Alternative D  Alternative E  Perm  Temp  Perm  Temp  Perm  Temp  Perm  Temp  Jeffrey Pine  1.5  1.0  0.4  1.4  1.5  1.0  -  -  Low Sagebrush  0.2  0.3  0.1  0.3  0.2  0.3  -  -  Total of Natural Habitats  1.7  1.3  0.5  1.7  1.7  1.3  0.0  0.0  Urban Jeffrey Pine  3.4  3.7  1.8  3.6  2.6  3.2  -  -  Developed  26.2  11.3  24.1  11.7  25.9  9.7  0.03  0.8  Ruderal  1.1  4.7  1.2  5.4  0.7  4.1  -  -  Total  32.2  21.0  27.6  22.4  30.9  18.3  0.03  0.8  Source: Data compiled by Ascent Environmental Inc. in 2015  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Because no project-related vegetation removal would occur with Alternative A, there would be no impact from this alternative to common vegetation communities for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements With Alternative B, 1.7 acres of common natural habitat (Jeffrey pine and low sagebrush) would be permanently disturbed or converted to new or improved roadway, roadway and pedestrian features (e.g., curbs, gutters, retaining walls), landscaping, and other project features, and 1.3 acres would be temporarily disturbed. The loss of this amount of common habitat from the Tahoe Region in this location would not substantially reduce the quantity or quality of these habitats in the Region, and would not result in a change in diversity or distribution of species in the Region, or result in a substantial change in local population numbers of any common plant or tree species or any unique, rare, or endangered species of plants or animals. Jeffrey pine forest and low sagebrush habitat are common and widely distributed in the Tahoe Basin and elsewhere in the Sierra Nevada, and the amount of habitat disturbance and loss would be very small relative to the total amount available in the area. Additionally, the number, distribution, and sizes of trees removed would not substantially affect overall canopy cover or reduce the abundance of this vegetation type on the landscape.  Permanent and temporary loss and disturbance that would occur with Alternative B would not substantially reduce the size, continuity, or integrity of any common vegetation community or habitat type or interrupt the natural processes that support common vegetation communities in the project site. Additionally, because the project site is already highly disturbed and fragmented by commercial/urban, residential, and recreational uses, project-related disturbances on the biological functions of common habitats are not considered substantial. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the disturbance or loss of common vegetation communities and wildlife habitats such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing None of the three potential mixed-use development sites are located within any common natural habitat types. Therefore, this impact would be the same as that described previously for implementation of the transportation improvements alone without the mixed-use development. The Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize the disturbance or loss of common vegetation communities and wildlife habitats such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for disturbance or loss of common vegetation communities and wildlife habitats as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the loss or disturbance of common vegetation communities and wildlife habitats would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on common vegetation communities and wildlife habitats. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements and the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would minimize the disturbance or loss of common vegetation communities and wildlife habitats such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements With Alternative C, 0.5 acre of common natural habitat would be permanently converted and 1.7 acre would be temporarily disturbed. This impact would be similar to, but less than, that described above for Alternative B because project construction with Alternative C would be located mostly in the same locations and would include the same construction effects as Alternative B, but would construct a smaller road footprint than Alternative B. For the reasons discussed above, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the disturbance or loss of common vegetation communities and wildlife habitats such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing None of the three potential mixed-use development sites are located within any common natural habitat types.

This impact would be similar to that described above for Alternative B because project construction with Alternative D would be located mostly in the same locations and would include the same construction effects as Alternative B. For the reasons discussed above, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the disturbance or loss of common vegetation communities and wildlife habitats such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing None of the three potential mixed-use development sites are located within any common natural habitat types. Therefore, this impact would be the same as that described previously for implementation of the transportation improvements alone without the mixed-use development.

Therefore, implementation of Alternative E would have no impact on common natural vegetation communities and habitats for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Impact 3.16-2: Disturbance or loss of sensitive habitats (jurisdictional wetlands, riparian vegetation, SEZ, aquatic habitat) Implementing Alternatives B, C, and D would result in direct removal and disturbance of sensitive habitats, including waters of the United States, waters of the state, riparian habitat, and SEZs. With the no-build alternative (Alternative A) or Alternative E, no project-related disturbance of sensitive habitats would occur. NEPA Environmental Consequences: Mitigation Measures 3.16-2a, 3.16-2b, and 3.16-2c have been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to disturbance or loss of sensitive habitats; No Impact for Alternatives A and E CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternative B, C, and D after implementation of Mitigation Measures 3.16-2a, 3.16-2b, and 3.16-2c; No Impact for Alternatives A and E Construction associated with Alternatives B, C, and D would result in permanent loss or temporary disturbance of montane riparian and montane meadow habitats, which are considered sensitive. Table 3.16-3 summarizes and compares the acreage of sensitive habitats present and affected on a permanent and temporary basis for each build alternative. Additionally, the NES for the project (TTD 2015) identified several potential wetlands and other waters of the United States within the project site, based on a preliminary wetland delineation conducted in 2010 and 2011. This preliminary delineation of potential wetlands and other waters of the United States has not been verified by USACE and will need to be updated prior to permit application and approval. Most of these areas are included within the montane riparian and montane meadow habitat types mapped and quantified in the project site.  Table 3.16-3 Acreage of Permanent and Temporary Effects on Sensitive Habitats  Sensitive Habitat Type  Alternative B  Alternative C  Alternative D  Alternative E  Perm  Temp  Perm  Temp  Perm  Temp  Perm  Temp  Montane Riparian  0.4  0.5  0.1  1.0  0.4  0.5  0.0  0.0  Montane Meadow  1.2  1.1  0.2  0.9  1.2  1.2  0.0  0.0  Total  1.6  1.6  0.3  1.9  1.6  1.5  0.0  0.0  Source: Data compiled by Ascent Environmental Inc. in 2014  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Because no project-related vegetation removal or other disturbances would occur with Alternative A, there would be no impact from this alternative on sensitive habitats for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements With Alternative B, 1.6 acres of sensitive habitats occur in the permanent disturbance area, and 1.6 acres are within the temporary disturbance area (see Table 3.16-5); these sensitive habitat features include Edgewood Creek, Golf Course Creek, and Stateline Creek as well the area east of and across Lake Parkway from the Heavenly Village Center and northeast of Montbleu. However, the values presented here are considered a maximum and likely an overestimate of the area of actual impacts. For example, montane riparian habitat is present where the proposed roadway expansion and improvements along Montreal Road and Lake Parkway cross Stateline Creek, Golf Course Creek, and Edgewood Creek, but the actual impact acreage there would be reduced because the transportation improvements would span much of the riparian habitat, rather than remove it. Additionally, the construction corridor would be reduced in sensitive habitat areas and best management practices (BMPs) would be integrated into the project design (as described in Section 3.10, “Water Quality and Stormwater Runoff”) to avoid and minimize impacts in these areas.  Construction or expansion of roadway alignments, roadway and pedestrian features (e.g., curbs, gutters, retaining walls), and other project elements could result in minor vegetation removal or trampling, fill of wetlands, hydrologic changes, deposition of dust or debris, soil compaction, or other disturbances that could temporarily affect the condition and function of sensitive habitats. Additionally, any project-related construction adjacent to wetlands or other sensitive habitat could similarly affect those resources, either directly or indirectly, although potential effects would be avoided or minimized through implementation of project BMPs.  Some of the sensitive habitats affected by implementation of Alternative B would be considered jurisdictional by USACE and (on the California side) the Lahontan RWQCB under Section 404 of the federal CWA and the state’s Porter-Cologne Act, and potentially subject to regulation by CDFW under Sections 1600 et seq. of the California Fish and Game Code. Additionally, most of the areas within wetland/riparian habitats are also designated as SEZ by TRPA. Fill or reconfiguration of jurisdictional waters of the United States requires a permit from USACE pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Also, the deciduous riparian vegetation within most or all SEZs would likely be considered jurisdictional habitat by the USACE and would require a permit and mitigation. Additionally, habitats consisting of deciduous trees, wetlands, and meadows (i.e., riparian, wetland, and meadow habitats) are designated by TRPA as habitats of special significance. The TRPA threshold standard for habitats of special significance is non-degradation while providing for opportunities to increase the acreage of these habitats. Where Edgewood Creek passes below US 50 and Golf Course Creek intersects Lake Parkway, the existing culverts at those locations would be lengthened to accommodate the wider roadway width with Alternative B. As described in Section 3.10, “Water Quality and Stormwater Runoff,” since TRPA, Lahontan RWQCB, and Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (NDEP) regulations are in place to minimize erosion and transport of sediment and other pollutants during construction, and since appropriate project-specific measures would be defined to secure necessary permits and approvals, project-related impacts to the stream channels and water quality would be minimized and would not result in substantial adverse effect on aquatic habitats. Implementing Alternative B would result in minor loss or degradation of jurisdictional wetlands and other waters of the United States, riparian vegetation, and SEZs protected by Section 6.3 of the TRPA Code. These riparian and wetland habitats are considered sensitive, because they are declining in quantity and condition throughout the region and because they provide important habitat functions. Even though the amount of habitat lost would be minor, the affected habitats are recognized as sensitive and important; the loss or degradation of sensitive habitats would be a potentially significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the loss or degradation of sensitive habitats.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing None of the three potential mixed-use development sites are located within any sensitive habitat types. Therefore, this impact would be the same as that described previously for implementation of the transportation improvements alone without the mixed-use development. The Alternative B mixed-use development sites, including the replacement housing, would result in a potentially significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the loss or degradation of sensitive habitats.  Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential loss or disturbance of sensitive habitats as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential impacts to sensitive habitats would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a potentially significant impact on sensitive habitats. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the disturbance or loss of sensitive habitats. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements With Alternative C, 0.3 acre of sensitive habitat occurs in the permanent disturbance area, and 1.9 acres is within the temporary disturbance area (see Table 3.16-5). This impact would be similar to, but less than, that described above for Alternative B because project construction with Alternative C would be located mostly in the same locations and would include the same construction effects as Alternative B.

Therefore, implementation of Alternative E would have no impact on sensitive natural vegetation communities and habitats for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Impact 3.16-3: Tree removal Regardless of the magnitude of biological effects of tree removal, native trees are protected in the Tahoe Basin, because of their natural qualities and functions. Because Alternatives B, C, and D would result in removal of more than 100 trees 14 inches or greater dbh, they would result in substantial tree removal. With Alternative E, native tree removal would not be substantial. While all build alternatives would require removal of trees greater than 24 inches dbh in eastside forest and/or 30 inches dbh in westside forest, which is generally prohibited by TRPA, the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project meets the exception in TRPA Code Section 61.1.4.A.7 that allows for the removal of these trees for Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) projects, provided that findings demonstrate that the tree removal is necessary. In Alternative A no trees would be removed. NEPA Environmental Consequences: Mitigation Measure 3.16-3 has been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to biological effects resulting from tree removal; No Adverse Effect for Alternative E; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, and D after implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.16-3; Less Than Significant for Alternative E; No Impact for Alternative A Section 61.1.8 of the TRPA Code defines substantial tree removal as, “activities on project areas of three acres or more and proposing the removal of more than 100 live trees 14 inches dbh or larger….” All of the build alternatives considered for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project would require tree removal. Project components, including roadway alignments, roadway features (e.g., curbs, gutters, retaining walls), and bike path realignment would be constructed or expanded in areas supporting conifer forest and other habitats.  With limited exceptions, Section 61.1.4, “Old Growth Enhancement and Protection,” of the TRPA Code prohibits the removal of trees greater than 24 and 30 inches dbh in eastside and westside forest types, respectively, in lands classified as conservation or recreation lands. TRPA has defined and mapped eastside forest types as those forests east of a north-south line from Brockway Summit in the north Tahoe Basin to and along the California-Nevada boundary in the south Tahoe Basin; westside forest types are those forests west of that line. The US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project site is within both eastside and westside forest areas. However, the project is exempt from this prohibition because it is on the EIP list of projects, as described in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives.”  Table 3.16-4 provides tree removal estimates by size class and eastside/westside area for each alternative. Table 3.16-4 Estimated Tree Removal by Alternative  Alternative  Eastside (NV) Trees Removed (dbh)1  Westside (CA) Trees Removed (dbh)1  Total Trees Removed  (≥14” dbh)  ≥14 - <24”  ≥24 - <30”  ≥30”  ≥14 - <24”  ≥24 - <30”  ≥30”  B: Triangle   133  22  17  396  141  118  827  C: Triangle One-Way  164  17  13  248  79  64  585  D: PSR Alternative 2  133  22  17  316  106  101  695  E: Skywalk   22  0  0  2  1  1  26  1 Tree removal numbers and dbh values were estimated from interpretation of remote sensed LiDAR data provided by TRPA in 2013 and project-specific field surveys that determined the typical number and size class of trees in representative sample locations in the forest.  Source: Ascent Environmental 2014   Alternative A: No Build (No Project) With Alternative A, the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project would not be built. Thus, no tree removal would occur and there would be no impact for purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements With Alternative B, an estimated 827 trees that are 14 inches dbh or greater could be removed, including 39 eastside trees greater than 24 inches dbh and 118 westside trees greater than 30 inches dbh. While Section 61.1.4 of the TRPA Code prohibits removal of eastside and westside trees greater than 24 and 30 inches dbh, respectively, Section 61.1.4.A.7 allows removal for EIP projects, provided that findings demonstrate that the tree removal is necessary. Regardless, the removal of 827 trees 14 inches dbh or greater would constitute substantial tree removal under Section 61.1.8 of the TRPA Code. Thus, this impact would be potentially significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to biological effects resulting from tree removal.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative B with the potential mixed-use development would require tree removal in addition to that described above for the transportation improvements alone. The estimated additional tree removal required for the potential mixed-use development has not been quantified; however, this impact would be greater than that for the transportation improvements alone. For the reasons discussed above, Alternative B with the potential mixed-use development would also result in a potentially significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to biological effects resulting from tree removal. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for tree removal as described for the mixed-use development sites.

Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a potentially significant impact on biological resources related to tree removal. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into construction of the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to tree removal. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements With Alternative C, an estimated 585 trees that are 14 inches dbh or greater could be removed, including 30 eastside trees greater than 24 inches dbh and 64 westside trees greater than 30 inches dbh.

While Section 61.1.4 of the TRPA Code prohibits removal of eastside and westside trees greater than 24 and 30 inches dbh, respectively, Section 61.1.4.A.7 allows removal for EIP projects, provided that findings demonstrate that the tree removal is necessary. The removal of 26 trees 14 inches dbh or greater would not constitute substantial tree removal under Section 61.1.8 of the TRPA Code. Thus, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would minimize the environmental consequences related to tree removal such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Impact 3.16-4: Introduction and spread of invasive plants With three of the build alternatives (Alternatives B, C, and D), project implementation has the potential to introduce and spread terrestrial and aquatic invasive plants during construction and revegetation periods. Noxious weeds and other invasive plants could inadvertently be introduced or spread in the project site during grading and construction activities, if nearby source populations passively colonize disturbed ground, or if construction and personnel equipment is transported to the site from an infested area. Soil, vegetation, and other materials transported to the project site from off-site sources for BMPs, revegetation, or fill for project construction could contain invasive plant seeds or plant material that could become established in the project site. Additionally, invasive species currently present in or near the project site have the potential to be spread by construction disturbances. The introduction and spread of terrestrial or aquatic invasive species would degrade terrestrial plant, wildlife, and aquatic habitats, including habitats of special significance (riparian) within the project site opening up the potential introduction and spread of invasive species with Alternatives B, C, and D. With the no-build alternative (Alternative A) or Alternative E, no project-related ground disturbances in any common or sensitive vegetation community would occur; therefore, there would be no related spread or introduction of invasive plants into common or sensitive vegetation communities and habitats from these alternatives. NEPA Environmental Consequences: Mitigation Measure 3.16-4 has been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the introduction and spread of invasive plants; No Impact for Alternatives A and E CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for the Alternative B, C, and D transportation improvement improvements and mixed-use development sites after implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.16-4; No Impact for Alternatives A and E Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Because no project-related ground disturbance or vegetation removal would occur with Alternative A, there would be no impact related to invasive species introduction and spread from this alternative for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Implementing Alternative B could result in the spread of invasive plants that are present in the project site. Invasive plant species documented in the project site include cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), ripgut brome (Bromus diandrus), and bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare) (TTD 2015). Additionally, new noxious weed species and other invasive plants could be introduced into the project site during construction. Construction associated with Alternative B would involve temporary ground-disturbing activities in disturbed and native vegetation types. Constructing or expanding roadway alignments, roadway features (e.g., curbs, gutters, retaining walls), and other project elements would temporarily create areas of open ground that could be colonized by invasive plant species from inside or outside of the project site. Invasive plants could inadvertently be introduced or spread in the project site during grading and construction activities, if nearby source populations passively colonize disturbed ground, or if seeds or propagules are inadvertently transported and distributed by construction equipment and personnel from an infested area. Project BMPs would reduce the potential for introducing or spreading weed and other invasive plant occurrences in the project site by reducing the amount of open ground during construction; however, the potential for this effect would still exist. Erosion-control materials, seed mixes, and unwashed construction equipment can transport propagules of invasive plants to construction sites where disturbed areas can provide ideal conditions for their establishment, and aid their spread into adjacent native plant communities.  Once established, invasive plant species can alter ecosystem processes and cause serious deleterious effects on native biological communities. Potential impacts to native species and ecosystems include altered hydrologic patterns, fire cycles, and soil chemistry; reduced nutrient, water, and light availability; and reduced biodiversity (Coblentz 1990, Vitousek et al. 1996, CalIPC 2006). The effects of invasive plant species can also decrease wildlife habitat values. Nonnative terrestrial and aquatic invasive species compete with native plant and animal species; their introduction and proliferation in ecosystems can substantially alter the dynamics of native aquatic and terrestrial communities. This conversion can indirectly affect wildlife and fish species by changing and often reducing food sources and habitat structure and can lead to competition between native plant species and the weeds, often resulting in loss of native vegetation.  The TRPA Code specifically prohibits the release of nonnative species in the Tahoe Basin because they can invade important wildlife habitats and compete for resources. Additionally, in its recent Regional Plan Update, TRPA adopted a new policy to explicitly prohibit and prevent the release of invasive, exotic, or undesirable nonnative aquatic species into the Tahoe Basin and control existing populations of those species. With Alternative B some of the construction BMPs would reduce the potential for introducing or spreading weed populations in the project site by reducing the amount of open ground during construction; however, the potential for this effect would still exist. Any introduction or spread of invasive plants could degrade plant and wildlife habitat, including habitats of special significance (riparian) in or near the project site. This construction-related impact would be potentially significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the introduction and spread of invasive plants.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative B with the potential mixed-use development would require some ground disturbances in addition to those described for the transportation improvements alone. Therefore, the potential for construction-related introduction and spread of invasive plant species could be greater than without the mixed-use development. For the reasons discussed above, Alternative B with the potential mixed-use development would result in a potentially significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the introduction and spread of invasive plants.  Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential to introduce and spread invasive plants as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential introduction and spread of invasive plants would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a potentially significant impact related to the potential introduction and spread of invasive plants. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into construction of the Alternative B transportation improvements and replacement housing to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the potential introduction and spread of invasive plants. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements The potential construction-related introduction and spread of invasive species with Alternative C would generally be the same as that described for Alternative B, because project construction and ground disturbance with Alternative C would be in the same locations and would include the same construction effects as Alternative B. For the reasons discussed above, this impact would be potentially significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the introduction and spread of invasive plants.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative C with the potential mixed-use development would require some ground disturbances in addition to those described for the transportation improvements alone. Therefore, the potential for construction-related introduction and spread of invasive plant species could be greater than with the transportation improvements alone. For the reasons discussed above, Alternative C with the potential mixed-use development would result in a potentially significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the introduction and spread of invasive plants.  Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential to introduce and spread invasive plants as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential introduction and spread of invasive plants would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a potentially significant impact related to the potential introduction and spread of invasive plants. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into construction of the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the potential introduction and spread of invasive plants. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements The potential construction-related introduction and spread of invasive species with Alternative D would generally be the same as that described for Alternative B, because project construction and ground disturbance with Alternative D would generally be in the same locations and would include the same construction effects as Alternative B. For the reasons discussed above, this impact would be potentially significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the introduction and spread of invasive plants.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Alternative D with the potential mixed-use development would require some ground disturbances in addition to those described for the transportation improvements alone. Therefore, the potential for construction-related introduction and spread of invasive plant species could be greater than with the transportation improvements. For the reasons discussed above, the Alternative D mixed-use developments, including replacement housing, would result in a potentially significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the introduction and spread of invasive plants.  Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential to introduce and spread invasive plants as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential introduction and spread of invasive plants would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a potentially significant impact related to the potential introduction and spread of invasive plants. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into construction of the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the potential introduction and spread of invasive plants. Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E would create an elevated pedestrian structure in an area that is entirely developed in urban uses and supports no common or sensitive vegetation communities. Because no project-related ground disturbances in any vegetation community would occur, there would be no impact related to spread or introduction of invasive plants into common or sensitive vegetation communities and habitats with Alternative E for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. 3.16.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures Mitigation Measure 3.16-2a: Implement vegetation protection measures and revegetate disturbed areas This mitigation would apply to the transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites included in Alternatives B, C, and D for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Vegetation will not be disturbed, injured or removed, except in accordance with the TRPA Code and other conditions of project approval. All trees, major roots, and other vegetation, not specifically designated and approved for removal in connection with a project will be protected according to methods approved by TRPA. All vegetation outside the construction site boundary, as well as other vegetation designated on the approved plans, will be protected by installing temporary fencing pursuant to Subsections 33.6.9 and 33.6.10 of the TRPA Code. Areas outside the construction site boundary that sustain vegetation damage during construction will be revegetated according to a revegetation plan in accordance with Section 61.4. Mitigation Measure 3.16-2b: Conduct delineation of waters of the United States and obtain authorization for fill and required permits The following mitigation applies to the transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites included in Alternatives B, C, and D for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. A preliminary delineation of potential wetlands and other waters of the United States was conducted in 2010 and 2011 (TTD 2015). However, the preliminary delineation has not been verified by USACE. Additionally, because the delineation was completed more than 5 years before project construction, it is considered expired, and will need to be repeated prior to permit application and approval.  Before the start of on-site construction activities on any potentially affected jurisdictional resource, a qualified biologist will survey the project site for sensitive natural communities. Sensitive natural communities or habitats are those of special concern to resource agencies or those that are afforded specific consideration, based on Section 404 of the CWA, Sections 1600 et seq. of the California Fish and Game Code, and other applicable regulations. If sensitive natural communities or habitats that are afforded specific consideration, based on Section 404 of the CWA are determined to be present, a delineation of waters of the United States, including wetlands that would be affected by the project, will be prepared by a qualified biologist through the formal Section 404 wetland delineation process. The delineation will be submitted to and verified by USACE. If, based on the verified delineation, it is determined that fill of waters of the United States would result from implementation of the project, authorization for such fill will be secured from USACE through the Section 404 permitting process. The acreage of riparian habitat (deciduous riparian vegetation) and wetlands that would be removed or disturbed during project implementation will be quantified and replaced or restored/enhanced in accordance with USACE and TRPA regulations, which include meeting the no-net-loss standard in accordance with USACE requirements. Habitat restoration, enhancement, and/or replacement will be at a location and by methods agreeable to USACE as determined during the permitting processes for CWA Section 404 and by TRPA during the permitting process for SEZ. In addition, on the California side of the study area, if any project activities would affect aquatic resources and associated riparian habitats subject to regulation by CDFW under Sections 1600 et seq. of the California Fish and Game Code (i.e., the bed, channel, or bank of any river, stream, or lake in California that supports wildlife resources), the project proponent shall consult with CDFW to determine whether a lake and streambed alteration agreement (LSAA) is required. If required under Section 1602, any compensatory mitigation shall be conducted in accordance with the terms of the LSAA, and in coordination with the other requirements of this mitigation measure (Mitigation Measure 3.16-2b) and Mitigation Measure 3.16-2c. Mitigation Measure 3.16-2c: Compensate for Unavoidable Loss of SEZ The following mitigation applies to the transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites included in Alternatives B, C, and D for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. The following measures will be implemented to ensure consistency with Section 61.3 of the TRPA Code and further reduce potential adverse effects on SEZs, streams, and riparian habitat:  All reasonable alternatives shall be implemented to avoid or reduce the extent of encroachment into SEZs.   In instances where there is no feasible alternative to avoid an SEZ, the project proponent shall mitigate all impacts within the boundaries of SEZs by restoring SEZ habitat (land capability district 1b) in the surrounding area, or other appropriate area as determined by TRPA, at a minimum ratio of 1.5:1, consistent with TRPA Code.   The project proponent shall retain a qualified restoration ecologist to prepare a restoration plan that will address final clean-up, stabilization, and revegetation procedures for areas disturbed by the project. The restoration plan for SEZs shall include the following:  identification of compensatory mitigation sites and criteria for selecting these mitigation sites;  complete assessment of the existing biological resources in the restoration areas;  in kind reference habitats for comparison with compensatory SEZs (using performance and success criteria) to document success;  monitoring protocol, including schedule and annual report requirements (Compensatory habitat shall be monitored for a minimum of five years from completion of mitigation, or human intervention [including recontouring and grading], or until the success criteria identified in the approved mitigation plan have been met, whichever is longer);  ecological performance standards, based on the best available science and including specifications for native plant densities, species composition, amount of dead woody vegetation gaps and bare ground, and survivorship; at a minimum, compensatory mitigation planting sites must achieve 80 percent survival of planted vegetation by the end of the five-year maintenance and monitoring period or dead and dying plants shall be replaced and monitoring continued until 80 percent survivorship is achieved;  corrective measures if performance standards are not met;  responsible parties for monitoring and preparing reports; and  responsible parties for receiving and reviewing reports and for verifying success or prescribing implementation or corrective actions. Significance after Mitigation Implementation of Mitigation Measures 3.16-2a, 3.16-2b, and 3.16-2c would reduce the potentially significant impacts on sensitive habitats (Impact 3.16-2) to a less-than-significant level for Alternatives B, C and D for purposes of CEQA and TRPA. The mitigation measures would require that sensitive habitat is avoided to the extent feasible and that sensitive habitats that cannot be avoided are restored following construction, or if the habitat cannot be restored, that the project proponent compensates for unavoidable losses in a manner that results in no net loss of sensitive habitats and meets TRPA mitigation requirements for impacts on SEZs. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the environmental consequences of implementing the transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites including in Alternatives B, C, and D with Mitigation Measures 3.16-2a, 3.16-2b, and 3.16-2c would not be adverse. Mitigation Measure 3.16-3: Prepare tree removal, protection, and replanting plan The following mitigation applies to the transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites included in Alternatives B, C, and D for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. A Tree Removal, Protection, and Replanting Plan shall be prepared by the project proponent to provide tree protection measures to comply with the performance criteria and other requirements of Chapter 61 of the TRPA Code, prevent damage to trees that are proposed to remain, and determine appropriate tree replanting locations and approaches to occur in the project site. The Plan will include marking and inventorying the specific trees to be removed, after detailed design is completed. A qualified forester will make a determination regarding the project’s consistency with Chapter 61 of the TRPA Code. The plan shall set forth prescriptions for tree removal, water quality protection, root zone and vegetation protection, residual stocking levels, replanting, slash disposal, fire protection, and other appropriate considerations.  Significance after Mitigation Implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.16-3 would reduce potentially significant impacts associated with tree removal because a qualified forester will be retained to develop a tree removal plan that would comply with Chapter 61 of the TRPA Code. By ensuring adherence to the TRPA requirements associated with tree removal, this impact (Impact 3.16-3) would be reduced to a less-than-significant level for Alternatives B, C, and D for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the environmental consequences of implementing the transportation improvements and mixed-use developments sites included in Alternatives B, C, and D with Mitigation Measures 3.16-3 would not be adverse. Mitigation Measure 3.16-4: Implement invasive plant management practices during project construction This following mitigation applies to the transportation improvements and mixed-use development sites included in Alternatives B, C, and D for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. In consultation with TRPA, the project proponent shall implement appropriate invasive plant management practices during project construction. Recommended practices generally include the following:  Before construction activities begin, invasive plant infestations will be identified and appropriately treated where feasible. A qualified biologist will conduct a pre-construction survey for noxious weeds and other invasive plants in project construction areas, and determine the feasibility and appropriate method of removal/treatment. Treatments will be selected based on their effectiveness for each species ecology and phenology. All treatment methods—including the potential use of herbicides outside of potential wetland and SEZ areas—will be conducted in accordance with the law, regulations, and policies governing the land owner. Herbicides will not be used in sensitive habitats, including potential wetlands and SEZs. Land owners will be notified before the use of herbicides for invasive treatment. In areas where treatment is not feasible, noxious weed areas will be clearly flagged or fenced to clearly delineate work exclusion.  To ensure that fill material and seeds imported to the project site are free of invasive plants/noxious weeds, the project will use on-site sources of fill and seeds whenever available. Fill and seed materials that need to be imported to the project site will be certified weed-free by the Resident Engineer. In addition, only certified weed-free imported materials (or rice straw in upland areas) will be used for erosion control.  Vehicles and equipment will arrive at the project site clean and weed-free. All equipment entering the project site from weed-infested areas or areas of unknown weed status will be cleaned of all attached soil or plant parts before being allowed into the project site. Vehicles and equipment will be cleaned using high-pressure water or air at designated weed-cleaning stations after exiting a weed-infested area. Cleaning stations will be designated by a botanist or noxious weed specialist and located away from aquatic resources. Equipment will be inspected by the on-site environmental monitor for mud or other signs that weed seeds or propagules could be present before use in the project site. If the equipment is not clean, the monitor will deny entry into work areas.  If designated weed-infested areas are unavoidable, the plants will be cut, if feasible, and disposed of in a landfill in sealed bags or disposed of or destroyed in another manner acceptable to TRPA or other agencies as appropriate. If cutting weeds is not feasible, layers of mulch, degradable geotextiles, or similar materials will be placed over the infestation area to minimize the spread of seeds and plant materials by equipment and vehicles during construction. These materials will be secured so they are not blown or washed away.  Locally collected native seed sources for revegetation shall be used when possible. Plant and seed material will be collected from or near the project site, from within the same watershed, and at a similar elevation when possible and with approval of the appropriate authority. Persistent nonnatives such as cultivated timothy (Phleum pretense), orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata), or ryegrass (Lolium spp.) shall not be used. Significance after Mitigation Implementing Mitigation Measure 3.16-4 would reduce potentially significant impacts from the spread of invasive plant species (Impact 3.16-4) to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA because invasive plant species management practices would be implemented during project construction and the inadvertent introduction and spread of invasive plants from project construction would be prevented. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the environmental consequences of implementing the transportation improvements and mixed-used developments sites included in Alternatives B, C, and D with Mitigation Measures 3.16-4 would not be adverse.    This page intentionally left blank. 3.17 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SHORT-TERM USES OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE MAINTENANCE AND ENHANCEMENT OF LONG-TERM PRODUCTIVITY NEPA (40 CFR 1502.16) and the TRPA Code of Ordinances (Section 3.7.2.F) require a discussion of the relationship between local short-term uses of the environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity of the environment. The following discussion addresses how the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project would affect the short-term use and the long-term productivity of the environment. In general, “short-term” is used here to refer to the construction period, while “long-term” refers to the operational life of the project and beyond. Implementation of the build alternatives would result in short-term construction-related impacts within the study area (construction impacts are described in detail in the individual resource sections in Chapter 3, “Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences, and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures”). Potential short-term impacts include ground disturbance and vegetation removal for construction access and safety of operations, temporary limitations to vehicle and recreation access in some areas, increased air emissions, potential disturbance of currently unrecorded cultural resources, transport and use of hazardous materials (e.g., fuels and lubricants), soil erosion and water quality impacts, and increased ambient noise levels. Short-term impacts would be minimized through implementation of mitigation measures intended to reduce environmental effects. Over the long term, these resources are expected to recover from any adverse effects without a loss in productivity. In the long term, the build alternatives would result in increased coverage (see Section 3.11, “Geology, Soils, Land Capability, and Coverage”); tree removal and disturbance and loss of sensitive habitats (see Section 3.16, “Biological Environment”); increases in ambient noise levels and visual impacts on neighborhood character in the Rocky Point residential area west of the Heavenly Village Center (see Sections 3.15, “Noise and Vibration,” and 3.7, “Visual Resources/Aesthetics”); and the division of the Rocky Point neighborhood and displacement of residences. These impacts would be minimized through implementation of mitigation measures intended to reduce environmental effects.  Implementation of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project would meet the need to address existing and future transportation deficiencies and projected multi-modal transportation needs along the US 50 corridor between Pioneer Trail and SR 207, to alleviate cut-through traffic in local neighborhoods in the City of South Lake Tahoe, and to support community revitalization goals in the California/Nevada state line area. The project would also meet the demand for transportation improvements to create well-designed, safer facilities that balance the needs of pedestrian, bicycle, transit, and private vehicle access while respecting the unique environmental setting of the Lake Tahoe Basin. The project would help the South Shore area to achieve revitalization goals, such as creating more walkable, transit-served public space in the tourist core through public and private investment, which would promote economic vitality.  Redevelopment of the mixed-use sites provides an opportunity for replacement of the displaced residents and business in the same immediate area. Depending on the composition of the mixed-use developments, these sites could include primarily affordable housing and provide a unique opportunity to meaningfully address the existing workforce housing deficiency in the Tahoe Basin.     This page intentionally left blank.  3 AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT, ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES, AND AVOIDANCE, MINIMIZATION, AND/OR MITIGATION MEASURES 3.1 APPROACH TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS As described in Chapter 1, “Introduction,” this is a joint environmental impact report (EIR) under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and its Guidelines, environmental impact statement (EIS) under the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) Code of Ordinances and Rules of Procedure, and an environmental impact statement (EIS) under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and its regulations adopted by the Council on Environmental Quality and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The overall content requirements of environmental documents are similar, although some terminology and content details vary between the three sets of environmental statutes and regulations. This EIR/EIS/EIS contains the necessary elements to satisfy the pertinent CEQA, TRPA, and NEPA requirements. The lead agencies preparing this joint document are Tahoe Transportation District (CEQA), TRPA, and FHWA for NEPA (including both the California and Nevada Divisions of FHWA). As a result of the Project Development Team (PDT) meetings, the EIR/EIS/EIS is prepared in accordance with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) Standard Environmental Reference and incorporates TRPA environmental review requirements. 3.1.1 California Environmental Quality Act CEQA and the State CEQA Guidelines direct that an EIR evaluate and disclose the significant and potentially significant environmental impacts associated with a project (i.e., locally preferred action in this document). The significant and potentially significant environmental effects of all phases of the project and project alternatives, including construction and operation, are evaluated in the analysis (consistent with Guidelines Section 15126.2). A significant effect is defined in CEQA as a substantial or potentially substantial adverse change to the physical environment resulting from implementation of the project. Where significant effects on the environment are identified, the document describes feasible mitigation measures and a reasonable range of alternatives to reduce the significant or potentially significant effects on the environment. Mitigation measures may avoid, minimize, or compensate for significant adverse impacts, and need to be fully enforceable through permit conditions, agreements, or other legally binding means (Guidelines Section 15126.4[a]). Mitigation measures are not required for effects that are found to be less than significant. An EIR must also identify growth-inducing impacts and any significant effects that are unavoidable. 3.1.2 Tahoe Regional Planning Agency Article VII(a)(2) of the Bi-State Compact requires TRPA, when acting upon matters that may have a significant effect on the environment, to prepare and consider a detailed environmental impact statement (EIS) before deciding to approve or carry out any project. The TRPA Code states that an EIS shall identify significant environmental impacts of the project (i.e., locally preferred action), any significant adverse environmental effects that cannot be avoided if the project is implemented, and mitigation measures that must be implemented to meet threshold standards of the Lake Tahoe Basin (Code Section 3.7.2). In addition, an EIS must include a discussion of the relationship between local short-term uses of man’s environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity and any significant irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources that would be involved in the project should it be implemented. The EIS shall also evaluate growth-inducing impacts of the project (TRPA Code, Section 3.7.2). TRPA has established Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities (threshold standards) and indicators for nine resource areas: water quality, air quality, scenic resources, soil conservation, fish habitat, vegetation, wildlife habitat, noise, and recreation. TRPA threshold standards are minimum standards of environmental quality to be achieved in the Tahoe Region. Every five years, TRPA evaluates the attainment status of all TRPA threshold standards. The latest TRPA Threshold Evaluation was completed in April 2012 (TRPA 2012). Pursuant to TRPA Code Section 4.4, TRPA is required to find that the project would not cause the environmental threshold carrying capacities to be exceeded. The EIR/EIS/EIS helps to inform TRPA in making the findings; however, the specific threshold analyses and findings will be contained in staff reports presented to the TRPA Governing Board during consideration of certification of this EIR/EIS/EIS and approval of a project alternative at the conclusion of the environmental review process.  3.1.3 National Environmental Policy Act NEPA requires federal agencies to integrate environmental values into their decision-making processes by considering the environmental impacts of their proposed actions and reasonable alternatives to those actions. The US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project is a proposed action subject to NEPA, because it includes highway improvements proposed for FHWA funding (23 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 771.107[b]). When the significance of impacts of a transportation project proposal is uncertain, an EA is prepared to assist in making this determination. If it is found that significant impacts would result, preparation of an EIS is necessary. Based on a preliminary review of potential effects and because this is a joint document with a CEQA EIR and TRPA EIS, FHWA has determined that an EIS will be prepared. The technical sections have been prepared in accordance with the Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR Section 1500 et seq.) issued by the Council on Environmental Quality. In addition, this EIS follows the FHWA regulations for implementing NEPA, including Environmental Impact and Related Procedures (23 CFR 771), Environmental Impact and Related Procedures. FHWA guidance complementing the regulations were issued in the form of a Technical Advisory (T.6640.8a), Guidance for Preparing and Processing Environmental and Section 4(f) Documents. The Technical Advisory provides detailed information on the contents and processing of environmental documents. Additional guidance and information on the NEPA process and other environmental requirements are found in FHWA’s Environmental Guidebook. The Guidebook includes up-to-date information to accelerate the delivery of transportation projects. It includes information on FHWA policy and guidance and provides links to transportation and environment websites and resources related to specific technical topics, such as air quality, biological resources, community impacts, cultural resources, Section 4(f), visual impacts, and water quality.  3.1.4 Incorporation by Reference TRPA and the Tahoe Metropolitan Planning Organization (TMPO) prepared a program EIR/EIS for the environmental review and approval of the Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan (RTP, also known as Mobility 2035) and Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS, for the California portion of the Lake Tahoe Region) (TMPO and TRPA 2012). This program-level document provides a regional consideration of cumulative effects and includes broad policy alternatives and program mitigation measures that are equally broad in scope. The 2017 Regional Transportation Plan (2017 RTP), which is an update to the 2012 RTP, and its joint CEQA/TRPA environmental document have been circulated for public review. The vision and goals of the 2017 RTP were based on the 2012 RTP. The projects listed in the 2017 RTP are substantially similar to those in the 2012 RTP, and the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project is included in both documents.  TRPA and TMPO have prepared a joint CEQA Initial Study/TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist for the 2017 plan as a supplement to the 2012 RTP EIS/EIR, that relies largely on that document’s analysis of potential environmental impacts and mitigation measures. Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15163, a supplement to the EIR need contain only the information necessary to make the previous EIR adequate for the project, as revised. TMPO intends to continue to rely on the 2012 document, as supplemented, so the environmental analysis in the 2012 document is still applicable. Because the approved RTP/SCS EIR/EIS includes the proposed US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project, some of its environmental effects, including cumulative effects, have been considered at the program level. Per the implementing regulations for NEPA (40 CFR 1502.21), “[a]gencies shall incorporate material into an [EIS] by reference when the effect will be to cut down on bulk without impeding agency and public review of the action. The incorporated material shall be cited in the statement and its content briefly described.” Thus, this EIR/EIS/EIS incorporates the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS by reference. It is available for review on the TMPO’s webpage (http://tahoempo.org/Mobility2035/) and cited and summarized in this document, where appropriate. 3.1.5 Contents of Environmental Analysis Sections This environmental analysis provides a comparable level of detail regarding the environmental impacts of all of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project alternatives under consideration. The analysis of the proposed roadway, bicycle, and pedestrian improvements has been prepared at a project-specific level of analysis, based on conceptual engineering plans prepared for the alternatives. The analysis of the three mixed-use development options has been prepared at a program level of analysis, because their description involves proposed land uses at the three sites, rather than design concepts. The mixed-use development project component, which extends beyond the minimum Uniform Relocation Act requirements, is not FHWA’s action as part of the proposed project. Discussion of each technical topic is contained in Sections 3.2 through 3.16. Section 3.17 contains a discussion of the relationship between local short-term uses of the human environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity. Section 3.18 discusses irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources that would be involved in the project. Section 3.19 contains a discussion of cumulative impacts in the context of other existing and proposed development near the project site. Chapter 3 includes the evaluation of all environmental topics originally identified for review in the Notice of Preparation (NOP)/Notice of Intent (NOI) for the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS and issue areas identified in the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist. Appendix A of this EIR/EIS/EIS contains the NOP/NOI and the Scoping Summary Report, which includes the comments received during public scoping conducted for the EIR/EIS/EIS. Other appendices have been included to provide ease of access to important technical information.  In accordance with CEQA, TRPA, and NEPA requirements, this environmental analysis examines 15 technical topics. The impacts in Sections 3.2 through 3.16 address effects from implementation of Alternatives A through E. Technical topic areas consist of the following:  Section 3.2, “Land Use”  Section 3.3, “Parks and Recreational Facilities”  Section 3.4, “Community Impacts”  Section 3.5, “Public Services and Utilities”  Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation”  Section 3.7, “Visual Resources/Aesthetics”  Section 3.8, “Cultural Resources”  Section 3.9, “Floodplains”  Section 3.10, “Water Quality and Stormwater Runoff”  Section 3.11, “Geology, Soils, Land Capability, and Coverage”  Section 3.12, “Hazards, Hazardous Materials, and Risk of Upset”  Section 3.13, “Air Quality”  Section 3.14, “Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change”  Section 3.15, “Noise and Vibration”  Section 3.16, “Biological Environment” Sections 3.2 through 3.16 of this EIR/EIS/EIS are organized into the following major subsections: Introduction: This section provides introductory text pertaining to each technical topic, including a brief summary of comments raised by the public in response to the Notice of Preparation, and issues dismissed from further discussion in the section. Regulatory Setting: This section presents the applicable regulatory framework and planning context, if any, for the specific technical issue as it relates to TRPA, federal, state, and local requirements. For applicable resource sections, the Regulatory Setting also includes a discussion of the threshold standard attainment status for the relevant TRPA Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities: water quality, soil conservation, air quality, vegetation, wildlife, fisheries, noise, recreation, and scenic resources.  Affected Environment: This section describes the environmental setting. The environmental setting presents the existing environmental conditions in the project site and surrounding study area, as appropriate. The affected environment constitutes the baseline, or point of comparison, for determining the environmental effects of the alternatives. The extent of the environmental setting area differs among the resources, depending on the locations where impacts would be expected. For example, air quality impacts are assessed for the regional air basin, while aesthetic impacts only need to be assessed for the immediate study area. Environmental Consequences: This section identifies and describes the methods and assumptions used in the environmental impact analysis, the criteria used to determine the level of significance of environmental impacts, the environmental effects of implementing the project alternatives, and feasible minimization and mitigation measures that could reduce potentially significant and significant impacts. The potential impacts of the alternatives are determined by comparing estimated environmental effects of each alternative with the baseline condition, which is the existing affected environment (as defined above). The significance determination for each impact is also determined with this comparison. Project impacts are numbered sequentially in each section. A summary impact statement precedes a more detailed discussion of the environmental effects of the alternatives. The level of significance of the impact is also defined for each alternative, prior to the application of any mitigation measures, if they are needed, and then, again, after the application of proposed mitigation measures. The discussion is organized by alternative and includes the analysis, rationale, and substantial evidence upon which conclusions are drawn. Some alternatives may have the same or similar impacts. In these instances, the reader is referred back to previous impact discussions to reduce redundancy. Many environmental impacts are the subject of existing laws and regulations intended to protect environmental quality. For instance, the TRPA environmental threshold standards and Code requirements; federal environmental laws, regulations, and permitting requirements; and state environmental laws, regulations, and permitting requirements each may mandate either specific actions or achievement of performance standards. Existing laws, regulations, or permits that specify mandatory and prescriptive actions to be implemented by a project that would avoid or minimize an impact are considered before determining impact significance. If a residual adverse or significant impact would occur after considering implementation of existing laws, regulations, or permit requirements then additional avoidance or minimization measures are proposed to further reduce the significant or adverse impact. Where existing laws or regulations specify a mandatory permit process for future projects, performance standards without prescriptive actions to accomplish them, or other requirements that allow substantial discretion in how they are accomplished, or have a substantial compensatory component, the level of significance is determined before applying the influence of the regulatory requirements. In this circumstance, the impact would be potentially significant, significant, or adverse, and the regulatory requirements would be included as an avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measure. This document provides environmental review at a programmatic level for the three proposed mixed-use development sites for Alternatives B, C, and D. These are the preferred sites for constructing replacement housing for displaced residents. Future development of the three mixed-use development sites identified in Exhibits 2-9 through 2-12 would be subject to subsequent project-level environmental review and permitting by the City of South Lake Tahoe and/or TRPA, with the permitting agency determined based on the size, nature, and location of the future project on each of these sites. If the replacement housing for displaced residents is constructed outside of one of these three sites, then full, project-level environmental review would be required. Under such circumstances, the replacement housing would still be constructed prior to displacing residents for the purposes of constructing the proposed transportation improvements in California. Project-level environmental documents would require identification of, and mitigation for any potentially significant environmental impacts, and would be prepared in light of the information contained in the program-level analysis in this environmental document.  Methods and Assumptions: This section describes the methods, process, procedures, and/or assumptions used to formulate and conduct the impact analysis. Where relevant, this section may also include dialogue on any issue that is not discussed in the impacts section (i.e., where no impact would be expected and the reasoning behind this conclusion). Design of the action alternatives has been an on-going process and refinements have been made for this EIR/EIS/EIS since the early phase of alternatives formulation. As a result, background studies have been revised as necessary to provide the best available information. Some of the background studies have been updated to reflect more recent design refinements identified for the project. For example, the Noise Study Report (Caltrans 2015) and Caltrans Project Report Traffic Operations Analysis Update Technical Memorandum (Wood Rodgers 2016). The analysis of alternatives in this EIR/EIS/EIS is based on the design refinements described in Section 2.4.8, “Further Development of Project Design.” Significance Criteria: This section provides the criteria used in this document to define the level at which an impact would be considered significant, in accordance with CEQA, NEPA, and the TRPA Code of Ordinances. Significance criteria used in this EIR/EIS/EIS are based on the checklist presented in Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines; the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist; factual or scientific information and data; and regulatory standards of Federal, State, and local agencies. While CEQA requires a determination of impact significance for each impact discussed in an EIR based on significance criteria, under NEPA, preparation of an EIS is triggered if a federal action has the potential to “significantly affect the quality of the human environment,” which is based on the context and intensity for each potential impact. The significance thresholds used in this document also encompass the factors taken into account under NEPA to evaluate the context and the intensity of the effects of an action.  Environmental Effects of the Project Alternatives: For each alternative, environmental effects are listed numerically and sequentially throughout each section. Analysis of each alternative is included under each impact. The discussion for each alternative is broken down into the impacts of the transportation improvements and the impacts of the proposed mixed-use development. A bold font impact statement precedes the discussion of each impact and provides a summary of each impact and its level of significance. Impact conclusions are made using the significance criteria described in each section and include consideration of the “context” of the action and the “intensity” (severity) of its effects in accordance with NEPA guidance (40 CFR 1508.27). To distinguish between NEPA environmental consequences and CEQA and TRPA impact determinations, each impact includes a concluding statement for NEPA environmental consequences and a concluding statement for CEQA and TRPA impact determinations.  The level of impact of the alternatives is determined by comparing estimated effects with baseline conditions. Under CEQA, the existing setting (as described in Affected Environment, above) normally constitutes the baseline point of comparison against which a significance determination is made. Under NEPA, the No Build Alternative (expected future conditions without the project) is the baseline against which the effects of alternatives are compared to determine the relative intensity of effects among the alternatives. NEPA also seeks identification of beneficial environmental effects, if they occur. Alternative-specific analyses are conducted to evaluate each potential impact on the existing environment. This assessment also specifies why impacts are found to be significant, potentially significant, or less than significant, or why there is no environmental impact or a beneficial effect for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA and why impacts are found to be adverse, not adverse, or would have no environmental impact for the purposes of NEPA. A “potentially significant” impact and “significant” impact are treated the same under CEQA and TRPA in terms of procedural requirements and the need to identify feasible mitigation. For the purposes of NEPA, an “adverse” impact would be required to identify additional avoidance, minimization, and/or mitigation measures. A less-than-significant impact, for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, and an impact that would not be adverse, for the purposes of NEPA, is one that would not result in a substantial adverse change in the physical environment. Both direct and indirect effects of the alternatives are evaluated for each environmental resource area. Direct effects are those that are caused by the action and occur at the same time and place. Indirect effects are reasonably foreseeable consequences that may occur at a later time or at a distance that is removed from the study area, such as growth-inducing effects and other effects related to changes in land use patterns, population density, or growth rate, and related effects on the physical environment. Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures: Mitigation measures are identified, where feasible, to avoid, minimize, rectify, reduce, or compensate for significant, potentially significant, or adverse impacts of the project, in accordance with the State CEQA Guidelines (section 15126.4), the TRPA regulations, and the regulations implementing NEPA. A level of significance after the application of mitigation measures is provided for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, as well as, including an indication of whether a significant, unavoidable effect would occur. For NEPA purposes, a determination is made as to whether additional avoidance or minimization measures are needed or feasible beyond the design features included in the alternatives.   LAND USE Land use planning is used to direct the amount, type, and location of land use and land coverage; balance land uses with transportation investments to achieve travel efficiency and reductions in vehicle miles of travel; and coordinate regional land use guidance with local land use plans. This section identifies the relevant federal, state, and local regulations and policies governing land use; describes existing land use patterns in the study area; and describes the land use planning structure and approach currently used by TRPA, the City of South Lake Tahoe, and Douglas County. It identifies significance criteria for land use impacts, and it assesses the environmental effects of each alternative. Where necessary, mitigation measures are identified to reduce environmental impacts to a less-than-significant level.  During the scoping process, the City of South Lake Tahoe provided comments on the Notice of Preparation/Notice of Intent requesting that the EIR/EIS/EIS address the project’s consistency with goals and policies of the City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan, as well as city development and engineering standards, the South Tahoe Redevelopment Demonstration Plan, and the Stateline/Ski Run Community Plan. The Stateline/Ski Run Community Plan has largely been superseded by the city’s recently adopted Tourist Core Area Plan. To the degree that these plans and standards are relevant to the project, they are addressed in this section. The methods of analysis for impacts on land use issues are the various plans and planning documents that regulate and control land use and planning in the study area: the TRPA Regional Plan, Code of Ordinances, area plans, and plan area statements; the City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan; and the Douglas County Comprehensive Master Plan. As discussed in Section 3.16, “Biological Environment,” none of the build alternatives would be constructed within an area covered under an adopted habitat conservation plan, natural community conservation plan, or other approved local, regional, or state conservation plan. Therefore, project implementation would not conflict with the provisions of an adopted conservation plan and this issue is not evaluated further. Cumulative land use impacts are addressed in Section 3.19, “Cumulative Impacts.” Recreational resources, uses, and facilities in the study area and relevant regulations, including Department of Transportation Act Section 4(f), are addressed in Section 3.3, “Parks and Recreational Facilities,” and Chapter 4, “Other NEPA-, CEQA-, and TRPA-Mandated Sections.” Impacts related to community character and cohesion, housing and business relocations, and environmental justice are addressed in Section 3.4, “Community Impacts.” 3.2.1 Regulatory Setting A variety of plans and policy statements administered by federal, state, regional, and local agencies apply to the build alternatives. Relevant planning guidance used to evaluate the potential for land use impacts resulting from project implementation is described below. The land use policies and designations relevant to the build alternatives are summarized in Section 3.2.2, “Affected Environment,” below. FEDERAL Federal regulations related to land use are associated with resources such as wetland identification and protection, special status species protection, cultural resource protection, and health and safety on private lands. In the Lake Tahoe Basin, authority to enforce many of these regulations has been delegated to TRPA and/or the states of California and Nevada.  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is the federal lead agency for the project. The only applicable FHWA land use regulation is Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act, which relates to impacts of transportation projects on parks, recreational, and open space lands; it is discussed in Section 3.3, “Parks and Recreational Facilities,” and Chapter 4, “Other NEPA-, CEQA-, and TRPA-Mandated Sections.” The U.S. Forest Service, Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (LTBMU) also enforces many federal land use regulations, and manages all National Forest System lands within the Basin. There are no federal lands within the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project site limits. The closest LTBMU holdings in the vicinity are Nevada Beach and Rabe Meadow east of the study area, portions of Heavenly Ski Resort, and lands near Van Sickle Bi-State Park and in the upper areas of the Edgewood Creek watershed.  TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) has established Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities (threshold standards) that are minimum standards of environmental quality targets to be achieved in the Tahoe Region (TRPA 2012b). No threshold standard applies specifically to land use, and the adopted environmental threshold standards do not define the maximum populations, densities, permitted uses, and other land use criteria for the region. However, the threshold standards do set performance criteria that may be influenced by land use planning considerations, including coverage, restoration-based incentives, and allocation considerations. Lake Tahoe Regional Plan The Tahoe Regional Planning Compact calls for the Lake Tahoe Regional Plan (Regional Plan) to establish a balance, or equilibrium, between the natural environment and the human-made environment. The Regional Plan includes Goals and Policies, Code of Ordinances, plan area statements (PASs), community plans, area plans, and other guidance documents. The heart of the Regional Plan is the Goals and Policies, statements of policy that guide decision making as it affects the Tahoe Region’s resources and environmental threshold standards, and are intended to provide opportunities for orderly growth and development consistent with those threshold standards. The Goals and Policies are addressed in six major elements: land use, transportation, conservation, recreation, public services and facilities, and the implementation elements.  The Regional Plan Update was adopted in December 2012. The Land Use Element sets forth the fundamental land use philosophies of the Regional Plan, including the direction of development to the most suitable locations within the Tahoe Region; maintenance of the environmental, economic, social, and physical well-being of the Tahoe Region; and coordination of the Regional Plan with local, state, and federal requirements. Land use designations within the project site and the study area are described in Section 3.2.3, “Affected Environment.” The Land Use Subelement of the Regional Plan’s Land Use Element includes policies pertaining to growth and development of the Tahoe Region. It is intended to direct the amount, type, and location of land uses and land coverage; balance land uses with the social, environmental, and economic well-being of the Tahoe Region; and coordinate regional land uses with land uses in surrounding areas. The full text of these goals and policies that are relevant to the project, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with the goals and policies, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.”  Code of Ordinances The TRPA Code of Ordinances (Code) compiles all of the laws and ordinances needed to implement the goals and policies of the Regional Plan. The Code regulates, among other things, land use, density, rate of growth, land coverage, excavation, and scenic impacts. The regulations are designed to bring the Tahoe Region into conformance with the threshold standards. Public agencies and organizations in the Tahoe Basin must comply with the Code or may establish equivalent or more stringent requirements within their jurisdictions. Permissible Uses Chapter 50, “Allocation of Development,” of the Code sets forth requirements for regulating the rate and timing of growth within the Tahoe Region. TRPA regulates growth through the issuance of allocations of housing units, commercial floor area, tourist accommodation units, and people at one time (the number of people that a recreation use can accommodate at a given time). An allocation is generally only required for the main use for which the parcel is developed; accessory uses do not require allocations.  Primary uses are defined in Chapter 21, “Permissible Uses,” of the Code. All parcels have one or more permissible primary uses. PASs, community plans, and area plans define the permissible uses that apply to a particular parcel. Examples of primary uses include hotels and motels, eating and drinking places, and golf courses. Subsection 21.2.1 defines allowed uses as uses listed in the applicable PAS, community plan, or area plan that are appropriate for the specified area, and projects and activities pertaining to such uses may be permitted. By definition, allowed uses are assumed to be compatible with the direction of the Regional Plan and surrounding land uses. Special uses may also be found to be appropriate, but require a closer evaluation. In accordance with Subsection 21.2.2 of the TRPA Code, a special use must be found to: (1) be of a nature, scale, density, intensity, and type appropriate for the surrounding area in which it is located; (2) not be injurious or disturbing to the health, safety, enjoyment of property, or general welfare of persons or properties in the neighborhood; and (3) not change the character of the neighborhood, or detrimentally alter the purpose of the applicable PAS, community, or area plan. It must also be determined that the applicant has taken appropriate steps to protect against any such injury and to protect the land, water, and air resources of both the affected property and that of surrounding property owners. Plan Area Statements The PASs provide a detailed guide for planning within discrete areas of the Tahoe Region. Each PAS is assigned a single land use classification and one of three management strategies: development with mitigation, redirection of development, or maximum regulation. Some PASs are designated as receiving areas for transfer of development commodities, or areas targeted for scenic restoration and affordable housing provisions. Additionally, PASs provide planning considerations, special policies, maximum densities for residential and tourist development, noise standards, allowable and special uses, and the amount of additional recreation capacity permissible. The PASs that are applicable to the project include PAS 080 Kingsbury Drainage, PAS 089 Lakeside Park, PAS 090 Tahoe Meadows, and PAS 092 Pioneer/Ski Run. The portions of the project site within these PASs are shown in Exhibit 3.2-1. The full text of relevant special policies in these PASs, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with the goals and policies, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.” PAS 080 Kingsbury Drainage A portion of the study area and a portion of the realigned US 50 right-of-way along Lake Parkway are located within PAS 080. PAS 080 identifies this area as “the backdrop country in the Kingsbury Grade area” east of Lake Parkway, which is characterized as mostly high hazard, with 5 percent of the area designated as a Stream Environment Zone (SEZ). The planning statement for PAS 080 states, “[t]his area should be rehabilitated to provide watershed restoration to enhance the area’s natural features and qualities (TRPA 2002a).” Portions of PAS 080 along existing US 50 were incorporated into the South Shore Area Plan (SSAP) when it was created in November 2013, and relevant policies that apply to these areas from PAS 080 have also been incorporated into the SSAP. PAS 080 includes a special policy that states the area adjoining US 50 should be maintained as a scenic view corridor. PAS 089 Lakeside Park PAS 089 Lakeside Park is located in California next to Lake Tahoe and south of the California/Nevada state line, west of the Tourist Core Area Plan (TCAP). The portion of the study area that includes transportation improvements around the Stateline Avenue/Pine Boulevard intersection is within PAS 089. The planning statement for PAS 089 states, “[t]his area should continue as a residential/recreation area while improving lake access opportunities (TRPA 2014).” No special policies in PAS 089 are relevant to the project.     Exhibit 3.2-1 PASs, Community Plans, and Area Plans in the Study Area PAS 090 Tahoe Meadows PAS 090 Tahoe Meadows is located in California north of US 50 between Ski Run Boulevard and Park Avenue. The portion of the study area west of the new Pioneer Trail/US 50 intersection (Alternatives B and C) or reconstructed Pioneer Trail/US 50 intersection (Alternative D) falls within the edge of PAS 090. The planning statement for PAS 090 states, “[t]his area should continue to be a residential recreation area, maintaining the established rustic character (TRPA 2002b).” This area contains an SEZ and the planning considerations identify the area as “being considered as part of an overall solution to runoff problems in the watershed.” No special policies in PAS 090 are relevant to the project. PAS 092 Pioneer/Ski Run PAS 092 Pioneer/Ski Run is located in South Lake Tahoe and includes a primarily residential area set back and separated from US 50 and Ski Run Boulevard by areas in the TCAP, and immediately southwest of the Heavenly Village Center. The southern portion of the new US 50 alignment proposed for Alternatives B, C, and D extends through the northern portion of PAS 092. The planning statement for PAS 092 states, “[t]his area should continue to be residential with improvements made to upgrade that character (TRPA 2002c).” A number of planning considerations identified for PAS 092 are applicable to the build alternatives. Some of the planning considerations identified in PAS 092 include traffic congestion, transit use, and overcrowding in housing units. No special policies in PSA 092 are relevant to the project.  Area Plans The concept of area plans was introduced with the adoption of the Regional Plan Update in 2012, wherein local public agencies may prepare plans for their jurisdictions that are consistent with the Regional Plan and assume the responsibility for permitting. Area plans use new development allowances for increased land use intensity in specific community centers. Area plans also include development ordinances and zoning designations. PASs, community plans, and use-specific master plans remain in effect in the newly-adopted Regional Plan (2012) until superseded by an area plan that is developed in accordance with and found in conformance with the Regional Plan.  Tourist Core Area Plan The City of South Lake Tahoe, in conjunction with and approval from TRPA, adopted the Tourist Core Area Plan (TCAP) on October 15, 2013, which replaced the Stateline/Ski Run Community Plan of 1994 (City of South Lake Tahoe 2013), with limited exception. The single parcel owned by the California Tahoe Conservancy (Conservancy) between Forest Suites Resort and Harrah’s surface parking lot is the only property addressed by the community plan. The tourist core stretches approximately 2 miles along US 50 extending from Fairway Drive to the California and Nevada state line and along Ski Run Boulevard from Lake Tahoe to Pioneer Trail. This area functions as the primary visitor and tourist district in the City of South Lake Tahoe and provides direct access to recreation opportunities such as Heavenly Ski Resort, Ski Run Marina, Lakeside Marina, and Van Sickle Bi-State Park. TCAP Policies applicable to the build alternatives are discussed below. Many of the policies in the TCAP are similar to those in the Regional Plan. However, the Land Use and Community Design section of the Regional Plan’s Land Use Element does include policies that promote improving connections for pedestrians and cyclists, development of multi-family residential and mixed-use, and new development in the tourist core that improves the character and establishes a distinct sense of place that are specific to the TCAP. The full text of these goals and policies, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with the goals and policies, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.”  South Shore Area Plan Douglas County, in conjunction with and with approval from TRPA, prepared and approved the SSAP on November 21, 2013 (Douglas County and TRPA 2013). The SSAP replaced the Stateline Community Plan, Kingsbury Community Plan, a portion of PAS 070A Edgewood, and a portion of PAS 080 Kingsbury Drainage. The SSAP is not a single, standalone document, but includes portions of other planning documents:   Chapter 2: Land Use Element – Tahoe Planning Area of the Douglas County Master Plan Land Use Element;  a designated area on the Douglas County Future Land Use Map;  a designated area on the Douglas County Zoning Map;  Chapter 20.703, Tahoe Area Plan Regulations of the Douglas County Development Code; and  design standards and guidelines applicable to non-residential uses (originally termed South Shore Design Standards and Guidelines, but now termed Tahoe Design Standards and Guidelines as they are now proposed to apply to all non-residential properties within the Douglas County portion of the Tahoe Basin). The SSAP includes policies that are similar to those in the Regional Plan. Because the portion of the project within the SSAP is limited to transportation improvements, there are few SSAP policies that are applicable to the project and are limited to enhancing and maintaining the aesthetic character of the built environment that compliments the natural environment. The full text of the relevant SSAP goals and policies, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with these goals and policies, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.” Community Plans The 1987 Regional Plan designated 22 areas as eligible to be within a community plan. Presently 14 community plan areas that have adopted plans. These plans supersede the PASs and are designed to be more responsive to the needs and opportunities of the respective communities. The original intent of the community plans was to concentrate commercial uses to reduce the negative effects of “strip” development and to provide incentives to renovate, revitalize, and remove blighted commercial development. Stateline/Ski Run Community Plan The Conservancy-owned parcel located between Bellamy Court and Lake Parkway is located within a remnant portion of the Stateline/Ski Run Community Plan (see Exhibit 3.2-1). There are no specific policies in the Stateline/Ski Run Community Plan that are relevant to this Conservancy parcel or the project. Environmental Improvement Program Please refer to Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives,” for a description of the Lake Tahoe Environmental Improvement Program (EIP). The US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project is included in the EIP (Project No. 03.010.02.24). Alternatives B, C, and D would also implement, at least partially, two other EIP projects (EIP Project No. 01.01.01.11: Stateline Water Quality Improvement and EIP Project No. 03.01.02.03: Class One/Two Bike Trail: Linear Park Trail to Stateline). Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy Adopted in 2012, the Lake Tahoe 2035 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), also known as Mobility 2035, includes a list of transportation projects and strategies to improve mobility in the Tahoe Region and provide the opportunity for environmental gains related to a reduction in personal vehicle travel and attendant greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, improved water quality, and enhanced recreation opportunities related to bicycle, pedestrian, and transit improvements. The RTP also includes a Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS), pursuant to California Senate Bill (SB) 375, Statues of 2008, for the California portion of the Lake Tahoe Region to enable attainment of Regional greenhouse gas reduction targets. The US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project is included as part of the RTP as a Corridor Revitalization Project, under the Tier 1 Project list (RTP #2) described as:  US 50 would be realigned around the Stateline resort-casino corridor to the east, between Lake Parkway in Nevada and a location southwest of Pioneer Trail in California. The new US 50 alignment would include two travel lanes in each direction with left‐turn pockets at intersections. Between Pioneer Trail and Lake Parkway within the resort-casino corridor, US 50 would become a local street and would be converted to two lanes, one way in each direction, with a landscaped median and turn pockets at major driveways and intersections. Expanded sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and traffic signals would be installed to improve the flow of traffic, improve pedestrian safety, and encourage the use of non-auto transportation modes along the roadway (TMPO and TRPA 2012b:4-6).  The 2017 Regional Transportation Plan (2017 RTP), which is an update to the 2012 RTP, and its joint CEQA/TRPA environmental document have been circulated for public review. The vision and goals of the 2017 RTP were based on the 2012 RTP. The projects listed in the 2017 RTP are substantially similar to those in the 2012 RTP, and the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project is included in both documents. Linking Tahoe: Active Transportation Plan Please see Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation,” for a discussion of the Linking Tahoe: Active Transportation Plan (ATP). The ATP updates the Lake Tahoe Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan. STATE No state regulations pertaining to land use and planning apply to the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project. Please see Section 3.3, “Parks and Recreational Facilities,” for a discussion of the Van Sickle Bi-State Master Plan. LOCAL This section includes a summary of and references to relevant policies from the City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan and Douglas County Master Plan. The TCAP and SSAP are planning documents prepared by the City of South Lake Tahoe and Douglas County in collaboration with TRPA, and the goals and policies of these plans are discussed above under, “Tahoe Regional Planning Agency.” The full text of the relevant goals and policies from these local land use planning documents are included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.” The consistency of project alternatives with these goals and policies is discussed in Appendix E and Impact 3.2-1 below. City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan The City of South Lake Tahoe adopted the 2030 General Plan on May 17, 2011. The 2030 General Plan is the city’s policy document containing elements that guide land use, transportation, public facilities and services, recreation, natural resources, and other decisions. General Plan policies that are relevant to the project address issues related to environmental justice, promoting pedestrian and transit-friendly development, encouraging housing to be incorporated into mixed-use projects in Town Centers, and other policies that address other resource topics, including air quality, cultural resources, recreation, and noise. Douglas County Master Plan The 2006 Douglas County Master Plan (Douglas County 2012) provides long-range guidance for numerous programs related to planning activities in the county including: development, open space preservation planning, transportation, flood and drainage, water resources planning and management, and capital improvements planning. The Lake Tahoe Planning Area is not included as part of the Land Use Element of the Douglas County Master Plan because the area is within the jurisdiction of TRPA, and the SSAP serves that function. This means that much of the planning guidance and many of the policies and regulations related to growth and development in Douglas County do not apply to the project. Other planning elements of the Douglas County Master Plan apply to the Lake Tahoe Planning Area to the extent that they do not conflict with the provisions of plans or regulations adopted by TRPA. 3.2.2 Affected Environment This subsection discusses the existing and future land uses and zoning within the project. Land uses and zoning for the project site are delineated by several planning documents, including:   the TCAP,  the SSAP,  the PAS 080 Kingsbury Drainage,  the PAS 089 Lakeside Park,  the PAS 090 Tahoe Meadows, and  the PAS 092 Pioneer Ski Run. EXISTING LAND USES WITHIN THE STUDY AREA Much of the study area consists of developed land with a variety of urban land uses punctuated with a few undeveloped or vacant lots, some of which are utilized for water quality improvement projects and snow storage. A portion of Van Sickle Bi-State Park and other open space or undeveloped areas are within the study area along the eastern section of Lake Parkway. Additionally, this area serves as a gateway between California and Nevada.  Several small businesses, including restaurants and a liquor store are located in the area between US 50 and Pioneer Trail southwest of the intersection of US 50 and Pioneer Trail. A residential neighborhood containing single-family homes, multi-family homes, and vacation rentals is located within the area east of Pioneer Trail, west of Montreal Road, and south of the Heavenly Village Center. See Section 3.4, “Community Impacts,” for a more complete description of this residential area. The land use conditions in the tourist corridor reflect the resort destination character of the area. In California, on the east side of US 50 and northeast of the Pioneer Trail/US 50 intersection, is the Heavenly Village Center, a commercial area containing a Raley’s grocery store and other commercial/retail uses. Heavenly Village, located north of the Heavenly Village Center, contains a gondola to the Heavenly Mountain Resort, an intermodal transit center, and a mix of commercial establishments. A timeshare lodging facility is located adjacent to the roadway at the California/Nevada state line and next to Harrah’s Casino.  Van Sickle Bi-State Park is located along the east side of Lake Parkway with its entrance at the intersection of Lake Parkway and Heavenly Village Way. North of the state line along Lake Parkway is primarily privately-owned forested open space to the east and the Harrah’s and Montbleu parking lots to the west. The area west of US 50 bound by Lodge Road to the south, Pine Boulevard to the west, and Stateline Avenue to the north, contains a number of tourist lodging facilities, commercial uses, and dining establishments.  In Nevada, the four major resort-casinos, Harrah’s, Harvey’s, Hard Rock, and Montbleu, are located along US 50 between Stateline Avenue and Lake Parkway.  The area between Pine Boulevard, south of Stateline Avenue, and the lake includes a mix of tourist lodging, housing units, and the Lakeside Marina. Land uses just south of Pine Boulevard include a number of water quality detention basins that provide required stormwater quality control for the tourist core.  SURROUNDING LAND USES Land uses surrounding the project site are generally similar in nature to the visitor-centered development within the project site. The Tahoe Meadows Historic District, a private community, is located southwest of the intersection of Pioneer Trail and US 50. Properties to the west of the project site north of Lodge Road consist of a number of tourist lodging facilities with the shore of Lake Tahoe and Lakeside Marina just beyond. Single-family and multi-family neighborhoods border the project site to the south. Van Sickle Bi-State Park and privately-owned vacant land containing Jeffrey pine and white fir-mixed conifer forest is located east of the project site. To the north of Lake Parkway and west of US 50 is the Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course, while north of Lake Parkway east of US 50 contains the Friday’s Station property, which is undeveloped.  LAND USE PLANS The project site is subject to land uses designated in the Regional Plan, which are also reflected in PAS 080, PAS 089, PAS 090, PAS 092, Stateline/Ski Run Community Plan, and further refined in the TCAP and SSAP. Land use designations in the study area include conservation, mixed-use, recreation, residential, resort recreation, and tourist and are shown in Exhibit 3.2-2. Because the City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan and Douglas County Master Plan are consistent with the land uses and zoning identified in the Regional Plan, PASs, Stateline/Ski Run Community Plan, TCAP, and SSAP, land uses from the general plan and master plan are not discussed further. Regional Plan Land Use Designations The Regional Plan’s land use designations, including those identified in the TCAP, SSAP, Stateline/Ski Run Community Plan, and PASs within the study area consist of Tourist, Residential, Recreation, and Resort Recreation (Exhibit 3.2-2). The allowable land uses associated with these designations are provided as follows: Conservation: Conservation areas are non-urban areas with value as primitive or natural areas, with strong environmental limitations on use, and with a potential for dispersed recreation or low intensity resource management. Conservation areas include: (1) public lands already set aside for this purpose; (2) high-hazard lands, stream environment zones, and other fragile areas, without substantial existing improvements; (3) isolated areas which do not contain the necessary infrastructure for development; (4) areas capable of sustaining only passive recreation or non-intensive agriculture; and (5) areas suitable for low-to-moderate resource management. Mixed Use: Mixed-use areas are urban areas that have been designated to provide a mix of commercial, public services, light industrial, office, and residential uses or have the potential to provide future commercial, public services, light industrial, office, and residential uses. The purpose of this classification is to concentrate higher intensity land uses for public convenience and enhanced sustainability. Recreation: Recreation areas are non-urban areas with good potential for developed outdoor recreation, park use, or concentrated recreation. Lands identified as recreation areas include: (1) areas of existing private and public recreation use; (2) designated local, state, and federal recreation areas; (3) areas without overriding environmental constraints on resource management or recreational purposes: and (4) areas with unique recreational resources which may service public needs, such as beaches and ski areas. Resort Recreation: Resort Recreation areas are the specific Edgewood and Heavenly parcels depicted on Map 1 of the Regional Plan.  Residential: Residential areas are urban areas having potential to provide housing for the residents of the Region. In addition, the purpose of this classification is to identify density patterns related to both the physical and manmade characteristics of the land and to allow accessory and non-residential uses that complement the residential neighborhood. These lands include: (1) areas now developed for residential purposes, (2) areas of moderate-to-good land capability, (3) areas within urban boundaries and serviced by utilities, and (4) areas of centralized location in close proximity to commercial services and public facilities.     Exhibit 3.2-2 Existing Land Use Designations in the Study Area Tourist: Tourist areas are urban areas that have the potential to provide intensive tourist accommodations and services or intensive recreation. These lands include areas that are already developed with a high concentration of uses, good to moderate land capability, contain existing excess land coverage, and are located near commercial services, employment centers, public services and facilities, and multi-modal facilities. Zoning Designations The TCAP and SSAP provide zoning designations for the portions of the project site within their boundaries, which are identified in Exhibit 3.2-3. Although the PASs and Stateline/Ski Run Community Plan do not provide zoning designations, these planning documents do identify allowable uses, standards, and guidance for development within their boundaries similar to what would be prescribed by zoning.  Tourist Core Area Plan The TCAP zoning districts within the project site include Tourist Center Core, Tourist Center Mixed-Use, Tourist Center Neighborhood Mixed Use, Recreation, and Open Space. The allowable uses in these zones are as follows (City of South Lake Tahoe 2013:5-5 – 5-6): Tourist Center Core (TSC-C): This district is intended to become a commercial, tourist and recreation destination with public gathering places to meet the needs of both tourists and residents of the south shore. This district allows for horizontal and vertical mixed use projects. The sub-district contains complete streets that support multi-modal transportation options. Permissible uses include tourist accommodation, retail commercial, entertainment, restaurants, recreation, and mixed-use residential development. Tourist Center Mixed-Use (TSC-MU): This district is intended to primarily provide for tourist accommodation uses, with supporting retail commercial uses to meet the regional demand for quality accommodation in the Stateline area in a manner compatible with a pedestrian environment.  Tourist Center Neighborhood Mixed Use (TSC-NMX): This district is intended to allow a variety of residential and non-residential uses to encourage a greater mix and intensity of uses in a pedestrian scaled environment that is appropriate to its neighborhood context and adjacent residential uses. Permissible uses include commercial, public service, professional offices, as well as residential and tourist development.  Recreation (REC): This district is intended to allow a variety of recreation uses such as dispersed recreation and parks. Permissible uses include day use areas and group facilities.  Open Space (OS): This district is intended to preserve land in its present use. The land in this district is predominantly open, undeveloped, or in a lightly developed [area] and is suitable for any of the following: natural areas, wildlife and native plant habitat; erosion control facilities, stream environment zones, stream corridors; passive parks; and/or trails for non-motorized activities.  South Shore Area Plan  The SSAP zoning districts within the project site include High Density Tourist, Town Center Mixed-Use, Recreation, and Resort Recreation. As defined in Douglas County Code Section 20.703.060, the allowable uses in these zones are as follows:  High Density Tourist (T-T/HDT): This is an overlay district for the tourist district containing existing resort-casinos and is targeted for redevelopment that improves environmental conditions, creates a more sustainable and less auto-dependent development pattern, provides greater access to recreational opportunities, and provides economic opportunities.     Exhibit 3.2-3 Zoning Designations in the Study Area Town Center Mixed-Use (T-MU/TC): This is a mixed-use district with a town center overlay. This is an area targeted for redevelopment, may include a mix of tourist, recreation, commercial, light industrial, public service, and residential uses. The overlay district is an area that is targeted for redevelopment that improves environmental conditions, creates a more sustainable and less auto-dependent development pattern, and provides economic opportunities and future development that will bring environmental gain to the Region. Recreation: This district is for private and public recreation areas, such as golf courses, beaches, state parks, and ski resorts. Resort Recreation: This district is limited to Edgewood Mountain parcels and allows for tourist, commercial and residential uses provided in conjunction with a recreation use. New development must be the result of development transfers that result in the retirement of existing development. Stateline/Ski Run Community Plan The land use classification for this community plan is “Tourist.” A special use permit is required for linear public facilities, including transportation routes.  PAS 080 Kingsbury Drainage The land use classification for this PAS is “Conservation.” Permissible uses include single-family dwellings, summer homes, local public health and safety facilities, pipelines and power transmission lines, transmission and receiving facilities, transportation routes, and other recreation and resource management uses. PAS 089 Lakeside Park The land use classification for this PAS is “Residential.” Permissible uses include multiple-family dwellings, single-family dwellings, tourist accommodations, eating and drinking places, vehicle storage and parking, transit stations and terminals, transportation routes, and transmission and receiving facilities among other public service, recreation, and resource management uses.  PAS 090 Tahoe Meadows The land use classification for this PAS is “Residential.” Permissible uses include single-family dwellings, transit stations and terminals, transmission and receiving facilities, and transportation routes among other public service and resource management uses. PAS 092 Pioneer/Ski Run The land use classification for this PAS is “Residential.” Permissible uses include single-family dwellings, employee housing, multiple-family dwellings, multi-person dwellings, transit stations and terminals, and transportation routes among other commercial, public service, recreation, and resource management uses. 3.2.3 Environmental Consequences METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS The land use analysis involved a review of relevant land use plans, policies, and regulations, which compares the existing conditions to the project alternatives. Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis,” includes a policy-by-policy discussion of each alternative’s consistency with relevant policies contained in the Regional Plan Goals and Policies, TCAP, SSAP, PAS 092 Pioneer/Ski Run, Lake Tahoe Active Transportation Plan, City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan, and Douglas County Master Plan. The tables in Appendix E include a consistency determination and supporting narrative for each policy. The consistency determinations rely on analyses contained in other resource sections in this EIR/EIS/EIS (i.e., Sections 3.2 through 3.16); therefore, the Appendix E discussion includes a cross-reference to the applicable discussion elsewhere in this document where relevant.  Although the draft 2017 RTP has been released for public review, and includes the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project, the 2012 RTP/SCS is the currently adopted plan. Because an initial study/initial environmental checklist has been prepared for the 2017 RTP as a supplement to the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS and does not result in new significant environmental impacts, the analysis below continues to rely on the EIR/EIS. SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA NEPA Criteria An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the project. Under NEPA, the significance of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. Regulations implementing NEPA require that an EIS discuss any inconsistency between the locally preferred action and state and local plans or laws, and if so, the extent to which they would be reconciled (40 CFR Section 1506.2(d)). No other specific factors related to land use are contained in NEPA, CEQ Regulations Implementing NEPA, or FHWA NEPA regulations in 23 CFR 771 et seq.  TRPA Criteria The “Land Use” criteria from the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist (IEC) were used to define the land use topics for evaluation. The purpose of the TRPA IEC is primarily to determine if an EIS is required and to help define the topics to be evaluated in greater detail. While many of the IEC checklist questions are conducive for use as significance criteria (that is, they include a defined standard, qualitative or quantitative), many are not, such as those for land use. Impacts would be significant if the project would:   include uses which are not listed as permissible uses in the applicable PASs, community plans, and area plans;   expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use; or  propose uses inconsistent with applicable goals and policies of the TRPA Regional Plan, and applicable Plan Area Statements and Community Plans. CEQA Criteria In accordance with Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines, impacts relative to land use would be significant if the project would:  conflict with any applicable land use plan, policy, or regulation of an agency with jurisdiction over the project (including, but not limited to the general plan, specific plan, local coastal program, or zoning ordinance) adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect.  ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF THE PROJECT ALTERNATIVES Impact 3.2-1: Conflict with or impede implementation of existing land use plans and policies Implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would have the potential to conflict with certain policies in relevant planning documents (see Appendix E and summarized herein). However, a conflict with a specific policy alone does not constitute “inconsistency” with a land use plan. The environmental effects of any policy conflicts are addressed in the individual resource sections in Chapter 3, “Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences, and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures,” of this document. Mitigation is incorporated to avoid or minimize significant effects to the extent feasible. Because Alternatives B, C, and D would implement the broader vision and goals of the overarching land use plans (i.e., RTP/SCS, TCAP, SSAP, and ATP), these alternatives would not be in conflict with existing land use plans.  Because Alternative A would not construct a realigned US 50 around the tourist core along with other pedestrian and bicycle improvements, Alternative A would not meet the planning goals of the RTP/SCS, TCAP, and SSAP; however, Alternative A would not preclude construction of future transportation improvements in the study area. Similarly, Alternative E would only meet some of the goals of these plans related to safe pedestrian movement along US 50 in the resort-casino portion of the tourist core, because of the limited extent and nature of the improvements. Neither Alternative A nor Alternative E would preclude the possibility for a future proposal to implement similar transportation improvements as those identified in Alternatives B, C, and D. For these reasons, while Alternatives A and E would not meet planning goals, they would not be in conflict with existing land use plans. NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives A, B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less than Significant for all Alternatives The project site is located within the City of South Lake Tahoe TCAP, Douglas County SSAP, the Stateline/Ski Run Community Plan, PAS 080, PAS 089, PAS 090, and PAS 092. The project is also regulated by the Lake Tahoe Regional Plan. Policies in the Regional Plan, RTP/SCS, ATP, City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan, and Douglas County Master Plan are also applicable to the project. Consistency with relevant goals and policies from these planning documents is provided in Appendix E. The transportation improvements proposed by Alternatives B, C, and D, consisting of realignment of US 50 around the tourist core and pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure improvements, are recognized as planned improvements in the RTP/SCS, TCAP, SSAP, and ATP (City of South Lake Tahoe 2013:6-4, 6-5; Douglas County 2013:65; TMPO and TRPA 2012a:4-6; TMPO and TRPA 2016:4-30).  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) With Alternative A, no new facilities would be constructed. As shown in Appendix E, policies would generally not be applicable to maintenance of the existing conditions. Implementation of this alternative would not implement planning goals associated with the RTP/SCS, TCAP, SSAP, and ATP (City of South Lake Tahoe 2013:6-4, 6-5; Douglas County 2013:65; TMPO and TRPA 2012a:4-6; TMPO and TRPA 2016:4-30). While the possibility for a future proposal of a similar project remains, its implementation is speculative. Although this alternative would not implement planning goals associated with a realigned US 50 and other associated improvements, adoption of Alternative A would not preclude future opportunities to implement similar transportation improvements as those identified in Alternatives B, C, D, and E, and would not be in conflict with existing land use plans. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, because of the reasons stated above, Alternative A would avoid or minimize conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements As described above, several plans that guide development in the project site recognize the realignment of US 50 and narrowing existing US 50 through the tourist core as a planned improvement; the project is also an EIP project. Implementation of Alternative B includes components that would improve safety and connectivity for pedestrians and cyclists, and enhance transit features, landscaping, lighting, and signage. The project objectives include reducing traffic volumes through the tourist core and “cut-through” traffic in neighborhoods, decreasing dependence on automobiles, creating a safe and walkable district that enhances pedestrian activities and safety, and providing opportunities for redevelopment and revitalization. As a project identified in the RTP/SCS (TMPO and TRPA 2012a:2-10), Alternative B would help implement the RTP/SCS. The tables contained in Appendix E of this EIR/EIS/EIS discuss the project’s consistency with specific goals, policies, and actions contained in Regional Plan, RTP/SCS, ATP, TCAP, SSAP, City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan, and Douglas County Master Plan. Alternative B would narrow existing US 50 through the tourist core, creating a low speed street, and would enhance pedestrian, bicycle, and transit access and facilities in this area. These are some of the features of Alternative B that would help achieve goals, policies, and actions included in the Regional Plan, TCAP, and SSAP that encourage redevelopment, development of alternative modes of transportation, and creating a seamless connection between California and Nevada and a seamless pedestrian street environment (City of South Lake Tahoe 2013:5-1, 5-2, 6-1, 6-2; Douglas County 2013:75, 76; TRPA 2012a:3-2, 3-4, 3-6). Realignment of US 50 around the tourist core along with transportation improvements, such as bicycle lanes and sidewalks between Heavenly Village Way and the new US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection, would reduce existing conflicts between cut-through traffic and pedestrians and cyclists in the Rocky Point neighborhood. Additionally, as described in Impact 3.6-1 and Impact 3.6-11, the realignment of US 50 would result in improvements in traffic operations compared to Alternative A during peak periods at the US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection. With these improvements, Alternative B would address some concerns regarding traffic congestion along Pioneer Trail and cut-through traffic through the Rocky Point neighborhood.  Alternative B would include replacement housing, planned to be in one of the three sites proposed for mixed-use development that are all within or mostly within the TCAP boundary; there would be no net loss of housing in the South Shore. The multi-family replacement housing would be constructed to the maximum allowable density in the TCAP and would include deed-restricted affordable housing equal to the amount of affordable housing displaced by the project. Alternative B would redevelop part of the town center near the state line with high density housing, that would provide for affordable housing near jobs and transit. For these reasons, Alternative B would help achieve policies in the Regional Plan, TCAP, and City of South Lake Tahoe related to affordable housing, redevelopment and high density development in the tourist core, and providing replacement housing for residents displaced by the project (City of South Lake Tahoe 2011:LU-11; City of South Lake Tahoe 2013:5-1, 5-3; City of South Lake Tahoe 2014:HE-3; TRPA 2012a:2-2, 2-12). As shown in Exhibit 3.2-1, portions of the project site are within the boundaries of PAS 080, PAS 089, PAS 090, and PAS 092. Only Special Policy 4 in PAS 080 is applicable to the project. Alternative B is consistent with this policy because it would only include minor transportation changes, including a new sidewalk on the mountain side of US 50 between SR 207 and Lake Parkway, that would not interfere with views in this area. While Alternative B would clearly meet the intent of certain plans (such as the RTP/SCS), Alternative B would be potentially inconsistent with certain policies in the Regional Plan, TCAP, and City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan. Alternative B is not consistent with policies related to development patterns and community character (Regional Plan Policy LU-3.4), traffic noise (Regional Plan Policy N-2.1, TCAP Policy LU-7.1, and General Plan Policies HS-8.3 and HS-8.4), SEZ restoration in the TCAP (Policy NCR-2.1), and environmental justice (General Plan Policy LU-11.1). The environmental effects of these policy conflicts are addressed in Section 3.4, “Community Impacts,” Section 3.15, “Noise and Vibration,” and Section 3.16, “Biological Resources.” Mitigation is incorporated to avoid or minimize significant effects to the extent feasible.  A conflict with a specific policy alone does not constitute an inconsistency with a land use plan. Therefore, because Alternative B would be consistent with and would implement the overarching land use plans (i.e., RTP/SCS, TCAP, SSAP, and ATP), it would not be in conflict with existing land use plans. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or are feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. Implementation of Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at Site 1, a portion of Site 2, and Site 3 would promote high-density redevelopment consistent with the intent of the TCAP and Regional Plan to encourage redevelopment, support a vibrant walkable pedestrian oriented community, and environmental improvements within the tourist core (City of South Lake Tahoe 2013:5-3, 6-1 – 6-2; TRPA 2012a:2-11, 3-2). Analysis of the consistency of Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, is included in Appendix E. A portion of mixed-use development Site 2 is located within PAS 092. Alternative B mixed-use development could include a combination of housing units and commercial floor area, which would help achieve PAS 092 policies and guidance for redevelopment of this area, scenic improvements, and receiving area for multi-residential units. Because mixed-use development located at Site 2 would potentially affect the existing drainage basin near the existing US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection, the mixed-use development would not be consistent with a policy related to maintaining stormwater drainage basins as view corridors (TCAP Policy NCR-1.2). Additional project-level environmental review for a specific proposal for the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, proposed by Alternative B would also be required to demonstrate consistency with this policy. Because Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would be consistent with and would implement the overarching land use plans (i.e., Regional Plan, TCAP, and PAS 092), it would not be in conflict with existing land use plans. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would avoid or minimize conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would result in a less-than-significant impact and the Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would also result in a less-than-significant impact on conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would minimize conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or are feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements With Alternative C, US 50 would be split into two segments—an eastbound segment (US 50 East) that would travel through the tourist core and a westbound section that would travel along existing Lake Parkway (US 50 West). Neither segment would be a complete street and the split directional traffic flow does not implement the traffic and bicycle patterns and circulation envisioned in regional land use and transportation planning documents (i.e., the Regional Plan and RTP/SCS). Similar to Alternative B, Alternative C would include construction of replacement housing. The tables contained in Appendix E of this EIR/EIS/EIS discuss the project’s consistency with specific goals, policies, and actions contained in the Regional Plan, RTP/SCS, ATP, TCAP, SSAP, City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan, and Douglas County Master Plan. Similar to Alternative B, Alternative C would generally meet the intent of the overarching land use plans but would be inconsistent with the policies listed for Alternative B transportation improvements above. Because of the nature of the one-way traffic through and around the tourist core and associated impacts on emergency response, Alternative C would not be consistent with policies related to emergency response (City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan Policies PQP-6.3 and PQP-6.6). Because Alternative C, even with implementation of mitigation, would result in adverse effects, for the purposes of NEPA, and significant and unavoidable impacts, for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, on roadway segment LOS, this alternative would not be consistent with policies related to traffic operations (Regional Plan Policy T-10.7, TCAP Policy T-1.2, City of South Lake General Plan Policy TC-1.2, and Douglas County Master Plan TP Policy 4.13). The environmental effects of these policy conflicts are addressed in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation.” Similar to the reasons described above for Alternative B, Alternative C would not be in conflict with existing land use plans. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or are feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The land use plan consistency determination for Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would be the same as that described for Alternative B mixed-use development including replacement housing, because the mixed-use development sites and development potential would be the same for both alternatives. As described above for Alternative B mixed-use development including replacement housing, Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not be in conflict with existing land use plans. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would avoid or minimize conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would result in a less-than-significant impact on conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would minimize conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or are feasible to implement. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements Although Alternative D would result in alignment of the new US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection further east than would occur for Alternative B, all other transportation improvements and construction of replacement housing included in Alternative D would be the same as those for Alternative B. For these reasons, the land use plan consistency determination for Alternative D would be the same as Alternative B. Therefore, as described above for Alternative B, Alternative D transportation improvements would not be in conflict with existing land use plans. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or are feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The land use plan consistency determination for Alternative D with mixed-use development would be the same as that described above for Alternative B with mixed-use development, because the mixed-use development components would include a similar amount of new commercial space and housing units in generally the same locations (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11). Therefore, as described above for Alternative B with mixed-use development, Alternative D with mixed-use development would not be in conflict with existing land use plans. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would avoid or minimize conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would result in a less-than-significant impact on conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would minimize conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or are feasible to implement. Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E includes development of a raised pedestrian walkway between approximately 100 feet south of Stateline Avenue and near the northern end of the Montbleu Resort (about 450 feet south of Lake Parkway), which was not previously identified in the Regional Plan, RTP/SCS, TCAP, and SSAP. Similar to Alternative A, implementation of this alternative would not meet planning goals associated with the RTP/SCS, ATP, City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan, TCAP, and SSAP. As shown in Appendix E, some policies would generally not be applicable to the skywalk because of the limited extent and nature of the improvements included in this alternative within the resort-casino portion of the tourist core and the areas directly adjacent (see Exhibit 2-13).  Alternative E would be inconsistent with certain policies in the Regional Plan, SSAP, TCAP, City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan, and the Linking Tahoe: Active Transportation Plan. Alternative E is not consistent with policies related to scenic resources (Regional Plan Policies SR-1.1 and SR-1.2, SSAP Policy 5.4, and TCAP Policy NCR-1.1), implementation of an EIP project (Regional Plan Policy FIN-4.1), pedestrian and bicycle system enhancements (TCAP Policies LU-1.7, R-2.1, R-3.1; General Plan Policy TC-1.7; ATP Policies 3.1 and 4.4), and ground vibration impacts (TCAP Policy LU-7.3). The environmental effects of these policy conflicts are addressed in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation,” Section 3.7, “Visual Resources/Aesthetics,” and Section 3.15, “Noise and Vibration,” and Section 3.16, “Biological Resources.” Mitigation would be implemented to avoid or minimize significant effects to the extent feasible. Similar to Alternative A, Alternative E would not preclude the possibility for a future proposal to implement similar transportation improvements as those identified in Alternatives B, C, and D, and would not be in conflict with existing land use plans. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the improvements included in Alternative E would avoid or minimize the conflicts with implementing land use plans and policies such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or are feasible to implement. Impact 3.2-2: Include uses that are not listed as permissible uses in the applicable PASs, community plans, and area plans or expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use Alternative A would be a continuation of existing conditions, and as such Alternative A does not include uses that are not permissible, nor would it expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use. The transportation improvements proposed for Alternatives B, C, and D, including the realigned US 50, pedestrian overcrossing, and pedestrian and bicycle improvements, meet TRPA’s definition of a transportation route. The raised pedestrian walkway proposed with Alternative E also meets this definition. These project features are identified as either allowable or special uses in applicable planning documents. Because existing regulations preclude the development of prohibited uses, and require that findings for any special uses be made before project approval, Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements and mixed-use development including replacement housing, and Alternative E would not include uses that are not permissible, nor would they expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use. NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the potential to include uses that are not permissible or expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less than Significant for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; No Impact for Alternative A Land uses and zoning within the study area are regulated by the City of South Lake Tahoe TCAP, Douglas County SSAP, Stateline/Ski Run Community Plan, PAS 080, PAS 089, PAS 090, and PAS 092. Chapter 21 of the TRPA Code includes use definitions, which are used in these plans to define a list of permissible uses. These plans also define whether a use is allowable (compatible with the surrounding land uses) or a special use (require additional findings to determine compatibility). Alternative A: No Build (No Project) With Alternative 1, no new facilities would be constructed and there would be no changes in land uses that would result in an inconsistency with an existing or adjacent land use. Alternative A would not expand or intensify any existing use, whether conforming or not. For these reasons, Alternative A would have no impact on proposing uses that are not listed as permissible or expanding existing non-conforming uses for purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Alternative B project features, including the realigned US 50, pedestrian overcrossing, and pedestrian and bicycle improvements, all meet the use definition of a “transportation route” in Chapter 21 of the TRPA Code. Transportation routes are listed as permissible uses in the TCAP, SSAP, Stateline/Ski Run Community Plan, and PAS 080, PAS 089, PAS 090, and 092; they are an allowable use in the Douglas County SSAP and a special use in the other planning documents. As defined in Subsection 21.2.1 of the TRPA Code, allowable uses are considered appropriate for the specified area, may be permitted, and assumed to be compatible with the direction of the Regional Plan and surrounding land uses. Special uses, however, require that the findings under Subsection 21.2.2 of the Code be made by TRPA. As described in Chapter 1, “Introduction,” the findings supporting these special uses would be incorporated into a separate Findings document prepared by TRPA staff for consideration by the TRPA Governing Board prior to project approval. For these reasons, Alternative B would not include uses that are not permissible, nor would it expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the potential to include uses that are not permissible or expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or are feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. Alternative B mixed-use development Site 1 and Site 3 are located within the TCAP. Site 1 is located outside of PAS 090, which is adjacent to Site 1 to the west. The land use and zoning designations for Site 1 are Tourist and Tourist Center-Mixed Use, respectively. The land use designation and zoning district for Site 3 are Tourist and Tourist Center Core, respectively. Site 1 currently includes the linear park, US 50, and commercial uses. Site 3 currently contains a parking lot. These land uses are existing conforming uses within the TCAP. The northern portion of Site 2 along existing Pioneer Trail is within the TCAP and the southeastern portion of this site is within PAS 092. The land use designation for Site 2 within the TCAP is Tourist and within PAS 092 is Residential. The TCAP zoning designations for Site 2 are Tourist Center Neighborhood Mixed-Use and Open Space. The land use and zoning designations assigned to these sites are shown in Exhibits 3.2-2 and 3.2-3. Site 2 currently contains detention basins, vacant parcels, hotel/motels, and residential uses. The future redevelopment of these three sites could include a combination of high-density, multi-family residential uses and commercial uses that could include a mix of general retail, personal services, eating and drinking places, business support services, and professional offices. However, no specific types of commercial uses have been identified at this time. As described in “Mixed-Use Redevelopment Sites” in Section 2.4 and Exhibit 2-10, the conceptual plan for the mixed-use development within these three sites is based on the maximum density and types of uses allowed within the Tourist Center Mixed-Use and Tourist Center Core zoning districts. For Site 2, the maximum density and types of uses were also based on what is allowed within PAS 092. Table 3.2-1 shows the types of uses that are allowable within PAS 092 and the zoning districts of the TCAP that are found within the mixed-use development sites. The types of residential and commercial uses that could occur on Site 1 would be consistent with the allowable and special uses within Tourist Center Mixed-Use. The types of residential and commercial uses that could occur on Site 3 would be consistent with the allowable uses within Tourist Center Core. The types and density of uses within the portion of Site 2 within PAS 092 would be consistent with and limited to those identified as an allowed or a special use under PAS 092, which excludes general retail uses. The types and density of uses within Tourist Center Neighborhood Mixed-Use portion of Site 2 would be consistent with the allowable and special uses for this zoning district. The types and uses that could be developed on Site 2 within Open Space are not allowable or special uses for this zoning district.  Table 3.2-1 Permissible and Special Uses for Mixed-Use Development Sites, including Replacement Housing, within the Tourist Core Area Plan and PAS 092  Plan Area Statement/ Area Plan  Land Use Classification/Zoning District  Primary Use Categories  Multiple- Family Dwelling  General Retail and Personal Services  Eating and Drinking Places  Business Support Services  Professional Offices  Personal Services1  PAS 092 Pioneer/Ski Run  Residential/Residential  A  -  S  S  S  S  Tourist Core Area Plan  Tourist/Tourist Center Core  A  A  A  A  A  NA  Tourist/Tourist Center Mixed-Use  A  A  S  S  A  NA  Tourist/Open Space  -  -  -  -  -  NA  Abbreviations: A = Allowable, S = Special, NA = Not Applicable, - = Use Not Permitted 1The TCAP includes “Personal Services” as part of “General Retail and Personal Services. “The definition of General Retail and Personal Services includes a description for ‘Personal Services’ that matches the description for ‘Personal Services’ included in TRPA Code (City of South Lake Tahoe 2013:C-6, TRPA Code Table 21.4-A).   As described above for Alternative B transportation improvements, uses that are considered special uses within the applicable area plan or PAS, require that the findings under Subsection 21.2.2 of the Code be made by TRPA. As described in Chapter 1, “Introduction,” the findings supporting these special uses would be incorporated into a separate Findings document prepared by TRPA staff for consideration by the TRPA Governing Board prior to project approval and permit issuance.  With adoption of findings regarding implementation of the mixed-use development identified as special uses on Site 1, mixed-use development on Site 1 would not include uses that are not listed as permissible uses in the TCAP. All potential uses that could occur on Site 3 in the mixed-use development are identified as allowable in the TCAP. The three mixed-use development sites do not contain any existing non-conforming uses; therefore, Alternative B with mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use.  Although some of the development that would be included in Site 2 would be allowable or a special use for PAS 092 or Tourist Center Mixed-Use, Site 2 could propose residential and commercial uses within an area designated as Open Space. These types of uses are not presently allowed within this zoning district. At the time of subsequent project-level environmental review for the mixed-use development including replacement housing, implementation of development at Site 2 would either require that (1) the site be configured in such a manner such that only existing permissible uses are located within the Open Space zoning district (none of the uses listed in Table 3.2-2 could be constructed in this area); or (2) that the site be rezoned as part of a separate action. Any rezoning to support development at this site would be completed as part of a future application for the site, which would be subject to separate and subsequent project-level environmental review. Because existing regulations preclude the development of prohibited uses on the mixed-use sites, Alternative B with mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not include uses that are not permissible, nor would it expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would avoid or minimize the potential to include uses that are not permissible or expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for environmental consequences from non-conforming uses as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential to include uses that are not permissible or expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would also result in a less-than-significant impact related to uses that are not permissible and expansion and intensification of an existing non-conforming use. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would minimize the potential to include uses that are not permissible or expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements The conclusion would be the same for Alternative C transportation improvements as that described for Alternative B transportation improvements, because the transportation, bicycle, and pedestrian improvements would be similar to those described above for Alternative B with a smaller footprint. For the reasons described above for Alternative B, Alternative C would not include uses that are not permissible, nor would it expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the potential to include uses that are not permissible or expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or are feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The conclusion would be the same for Alternative C with mixed-use development as that described for Alternative B with mixed-use development, because the same amount and types of mixed-use development would be located in the same locations as proposed for Alternative B. For the reasons described above for Alternative B, Alternative C would not include uses that are not permissible, nor would it expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would avoid or minimize the potential to include uses that are not permissible or expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for environmental consequences from non-conforming uses as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential to include uses that are not permissible or expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would also result in a less-than-significant impact related to uses that are not permissible and expansion and intensification of an existing non-conforming use. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would minimize the potential to include uses that are not permissible or expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements The conclusion would be the same for Alternative D transportation improvements as that described for Alternative B transportation improvements, because the transportation, bicycle, and pedestrian improvements would be similar to those described above for Alternative B. For the reasons described above for Alternative B, Alternative D would not include uses that are not permissible, nor would it expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the potential to include uses that are not permissible or expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or are feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The conclusion would be similar for Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as that described for Alternative B with mixed-use development, including replacement housing, because the mixed-use development sites could include similar densities and types of residential and commercial uses in similar locations as Alternative B. Site 1A currently contains commercial uses and vacant parcels. Site 1B includes existing hotel/motels and residences. Site 2 contains detention basins and residential uses. Site 3 currently contains a parking lot. These land uses are existing conforming uses within the TCAP. The land use designations and zoning districts assigned to these sites by the TCAP and PAS 092 are shown in Exhibits 3.2-2 and 3.2-3. The location, types, and density of development on Site 1A for Alternative D is the same as Site 1 for Alternative B. The location, types, and density of development on Site 3 for Alternative D is the same as that for Alternative B. See discussions for Site 1 and Site 3 above for Alternative B. Alternative D mixed-use development Site 1B is located within a portion of the TCAP with the Tourist Center Neighborhood Mixed-Use zoning district and within PAS 092. The types of residential and commercial uses that are proposed for Site 1B would be consistent with the density and allowable and special uses shown in Table 3.2-1. The southeastern portion of Site 2 is within PAS 092 and the northwestern portion of Site 2 currently containing detention basins is within the Open Space zoning district of the TCAP. The types of residential and commercial uses that are proposed for the southeastern portion of Site 2 would be consistent with the density and allowable and special uses shown for PAS 092 in Table 3.2-1. The types and uses proposed for the northwestern portion of Site 2 within Open Space are not allowable or special uses for this zoning district. The three mixed-use development sites do not contain any existing non-conforming uses; therefore, Alternative D with mixed-use development would not expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use. For the reasons described above under Alternative B for Site 1 and Site 3, Alternative D Site 1A and Site 3 would not include uses that are not listed as allowable or special uses in the TCAP. Furthermore, as described in this impact, Alternative D Site 1B would not include uses that are not listed as allowable or special uses in the TCAP or PAS 092. Although some of the development that would be included in Site 2 would be allowable or a special use for PAS 092, Site 2 would propose residential and commercial uses within an area designated as Open Space in the TCAP that are currently not allowed or special uses for this designation. This is the same circumstance as Alternative B. For these reasons, Alternative D would not include uses that are not permissible, nor would it expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would avoid or minimize the potential to include uses that are not permissible or expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for environmental consequences from non-conforming uses as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential to include uses that are not permissible or expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would also result in a less-than-significant impact related to uses that are not permissible and expansion and intensification of an existing non-conforming use. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would minimize the potential to include uses that are not permissible or expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative E: Skywalk The skywalk, a raised pedestrian walkway, would be located in an area designated as Tourist in the TCAP and SSAP and within the Tourist Center Core zoning district of the TCAP in California and within the High Density Tourist zoning district of the SSAP. The skywalk would be considered a transportation route because it is a public right-of-way that permits pedestrian travel (City of South Lake Tahoe 2013:C-10) and is identified as a permissible use in the SSAP (Code Section 207.03.090.090D) and with a special permit in the TCAP. The pedestrian walkway could be used as a public gathering place that could meet the needs of tourists and residents. Within the SSAP, Alternative E would comply with the requirements of the High Density Tourist District to create a less auto-dependent development pattern because this alternative would enhance the pedestrian environment and improve pedestrian safety. The TCAP and SSAP do not specifically identify a raised pedestrian walkway as a permissible use; however, Alternative E includes pedestrian features that would be consistent with land uses and zoning districts in the TCAP and SSAP. For these reasons, Alternative E would not include uses that are not permissible, nor would it expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the Alternative E would avoid or minimize the potential to include uses that are not permissible or expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. 3.2.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures No avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement for the purposes of NEPA or to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  COMMUNITY IMPACTS This section describes the regulatory setting and existing conditions for three types of community impacts—community character and cohesion, relocations and real property acquisition, and environmental justice—all of which relate to population, employment, and housing. The potential impacts of the project alternatives are analyzed and mitigation measures are provided for those impacts determined to be significant. The primary issues raised during scoping that pertain to community impacts included the following:  Analysis about the impacts of the project on housing, especially for low-income residents. Housing relocation and mitigation measures should consider, at the least, development of new housing, conversion of existing motels to housing, and modifications to existing housing to better meet the housing needs in the surrounding area.  Concern from property owners that could be affected by the project.  Concern about adverse effects on businesses along the existing US 50 corridor.   Suggestions for additional parking and other improvements that would maintain the existing traffic flow and could minimize pedestrians crossing US 50.  Concern about driver experience crossing the state line if the number of lanes is reduced through the casino corridor.  Concern about pedestrian access through the neighborhood.  Estimates of the availability of housing of the same type and quality of those housing units that would be removed. It would also be of value to those whose homes are affected, to have estimates of the prices of the same type and quality of housing that would be available, to help determine the kind and amount of funding that would have to be made available for the purchase of those homes.  Concern about acquisition of private property for the project and if eminent domain would be used.  Concern for maintaining access to businesses during construction.  Amount of compensation for the affected residents.  Concerns for the cost of this project, the funding source, and if it comes out of taxpayers’ pockets.  Acquisition of Tahoe Meadows land is unclear.  Affordable relocation options for displaced housing and businesses. The primary sources of information used in preparing this section are the Community Impact Assessment (CIA; Federal Highway Administration [FHWA] et al. 2014), the Relocation Study for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project (TTD 2012), and the Economic Analysis of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project (TTD 2013).  Issues related to project-related inducement of population growth and economic effects of the project are discussed in Chapter 4, “Other NEPA-, CEQA-, and TRPA-Mandated Sections.”   It is planned that the redevelopment of Sites 1, 2, and 3 for Alternatives B, C, and D would not involve the subdivision of land and, therefore, TRPA Code provisions addressing subdivision (such as mitigation for loss of moderate-income housing in the residential area required under Code Section 39.3.2.B) are not applicable and need not be evaluated further in this EIR/EIS/EIS. Because community impacts include economic and socioeconomic issues along with environmental effects, Section 3.4 is divided into subsections for a comprehensive analysis of the range of topics. Subsections provided below are: 3.4.1 Community Character and Cohesion; 3.4.2 Real Property Acquisitions, Displacements, and Relocations; and 3.4.3 Environmental Justice. Analysis of economic effects of the project, such as effects on businesses in the tourist core, is included in Section 4.6 of Chapter 4, “Other NEPA-, CEQA-, and TRPA-Mandated Sections.” 3.4.1 Community Character and Cohesion REGULATORY SETTING Federal National Environmental Policy Act The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended, established that the federal government use all practicable means to ensure that all Americans have safe, healthful, productive, and aesthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings (42 U.S. Code [USC] Section 4331[b][2]). FHWA in its implementation of NEPA (23 USC Section 109[h]) directs that final decisions on projects are to be made in the best overall public interest. This requires taking into account adverse environmental impacts, such as destruction or disruption of human-made resources, community cohesion, and the availability of public facilities and services. Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act The Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (Uniform Act), as amended in 1987, is applicable to all projects involving federal funds; it provides for uniform and equitable treatment of persons displaced from their homes, businesses, non-profit associations, or farms by federal and federally assisted programs and establishes uniform and equitable land acquisition policies. The Uniform Act assures that such persons are treated fairly, consistently, and equitably so that they will not suffer disproportionate injuries. As set forth in 49 CFR 24, whenever there are relocation impacts involved in a federal aid project, the environmental document (environmental assessment or EIS) shall contain model language regarding the Uniform Act and shall cite its full title. The Uniform Act is relevant where implementation of transportation projects supported by federal funds may involve displacement of homes and businesses. Agencies conducting a program or project under the Uniform Act must carry out their legal responsibilities to affected property owners and displaced persons, which include the following:  For Real Property Acquisition  Appraise property before negotiations  Invite the property owner to accompany the appraiser during the property inspection  Provide the owner with a written offer of just compensation and a summary of what is being acquired  Pay for property before possession  Reimburse expenses resulting from the transfer of title such as recording fees, prepaid real estate taxes, or other expenses  For Residential Displacements  Provide relocation advisory services to displaced tenants and owner occupants  Provide a minimum 90 days written notice to vacate before requiring possession  Reimburse for moving expenses  Provide payments for the added cost of renting or purchasing comparable replacement housing  For Nonresidential Displacements (businesses, farms, and nonprofit organizations)  Provide relocation advisory services  Provide a minimum 90 days written notice to vacate before requiring possession  Reimburse for moving and reestablishment expenses Relocation benefits would be paid to eligible displaced persons upon submission of required claim forms and documentation regarding the rental or purchase of decent, safe and sanitary replacement housing. Displacees are required to show documentation that they are U.S. citizens or legal resident. Eligibility requirements and calculations would be identified on an individual basis with all residential and commercial displaces. In the course of personal interviews and follow-up visits, each displacee would receive counseling regarding available benefit options and the requirements to claim compensation for moving payments and replacement housing assistance. Section 24.402(b) of the Uniform Act requires determination if a displaced person is a “low income” person, as defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s annual survey of income limits for the Public Housing and Section 8 Programs. Additionally, Section 24.2(a)(8)(vii) of the Uniform Act requires that replacement housing for a displaced person with a disability, be free of any barriers that would preclude reasonable ingress, egress, or use of the dwelling by such displaced person. TTD staff would promptly evaluate advance payment requests to alleviate hardships for tenants who do not have access to sufficient funds to pay move-in costs, such as first month’s rent and/or security deposits. Approved requests for advance payments would be processed expeditiously to help avoid the loss of desirable, appropriate replacement housing. Refer to Appendix F, “Relocation Study,” for more details about the procedures and requirements TTD would follow to meet the requirements of the Uniform Act for residential and business relocation assistance. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency Lake Tahoe Regional Plan The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) regulates growth and development in the Lake Tahoe Region through the Regional Plan, which includes the Goals and Policies, Code of Ordinances, and Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities (thresholds).  Goals and Policies  Goals and Policies included in the Land Use Subelement identify redevelopment of town centers as a priority and indicate that future development should balance economic health, social health, and environmental quality (Policy LU-1.3; TRPA 2012a:2-2). The full text of these goals and policies, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with the goals and policies, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.” Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities TRPA has not established any thresholds related to community impacts. State California Environmental Quality Act Under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), an economic or social change by itself is not considered a significant effect on the environment. However, if a social or economic change is related to a physical change, then social or economic change may be considered in determining whether the physical change is significant. Because this project would result in physical change to the environment, it is appropriate to consider changes to community character and cohesion in assessing the significance of the project’s effects. California Relocation Assistance Law The California Relocation Assistance Law (California Government Code Section 7260 et seq.) regulates and governs programs and projects funded without federal financial assistance. The relocation statute is intended to ensure that displaced persons receive fair and equitable treatment and do not suffer disproportionately as a result of programs designed for the benefit of the public as a whole. In the acquisition of real property by a public entity, the Relocation Assistance Law ensures consistent and fair treatment for tenants and property owners. It encourages acquisition by agreement with owners and tenants, rather than eminent domain, to avoid litigation, relieve congestion in courts, and promote confidence in public land acquisition.  To help public agencies implement the statute, the California Department of Housing and Community Development prepared state Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Guidelines (Guidelines), which are published in the California Code of Regulations (25 CCR Section 6000 et seq.) The Guidelines are intended to establish only minimum requirements for relocation assistance and payments. They shall not be construed to limit any other authority or obligation that a public entity may have to provide additional assistance and payments. Refer to Appendix F, “Relocation Study,” for more details about the procedures and requirements TTD would follow to meet the requirements of the California Relocation Assistance Law for residential and business relocation assistance. California Department of Transportation Relocation Assistance Plan The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) Relocation Assistance Program (RAP) is based on the Uniform Act and Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 24. The purpose of the RAP is to ensure that persons displaced as a result of a transportation project are treated fairly, consistently, and equitably so that such persons will not suffer disproportionate injuries as a result of projects designed for the benefit of the public as a whole. The RAP is implemented through the Relocation Study in Appendix F of this Draft EIR/EIS/EIS. All relocation services and benefits are administered without regard to race, color, national origin, or sex in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act (42 USC Section 2000d et seq.). Local City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan The Land Use Element and Housing Element of the City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan include policies that promote walking to services, biking, and transit use; foster community pride; enhance neighborhood identity; ensure public safety; and are family friendly (Policy LU-3.1). The Housing Element includes policies that provide for housing opportunities for residents of all economic levels, including through development of housing in mixed-use projects in Town Centers, high-density residential in walking distance to transit and services (Policy 1-6 and Policy 1-7). The city shall support high-density and mixed-use development through incentives, such as increased density and height allowances (Policy 1-8). Policies also state that, in the case of displacement, project applicants shall be required to relocate low- and moderate-income tenants and/or replace the lost low- and moderate-income housing units (Policy 3-4) (City of South Lake Tahoe 2014:LU-12, HE-2 – HE-3, HE-14). The full text of these goals and policies, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with the goals and policies, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.” AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT Study Area Definition For purposes of this analysis of community impacts, the CIA study area includes an area of adequate size to address neighborhood conditions near the project. The CIA study area is limited to the area where direct and indirect adverse effects may occur. The CIA study area shown in Exhibit 3.4-1 is different than the general study area for the project shown in Exhibit 2-1. Direct impacts would be limited to parcels immediately adjacent to US 50, adjacent to the intersecting roads, and adjacent to the project footprint, which includes the Rocky Point neighborhood west of the Heavenly Village Center. The CIA study area was defined as including the census blocks from the City of South Lake Tahoe, California Census Tract 316 and Stateline Census Designated Place (CDP), Nevada Census Tracts 17 and 18 (FHWA et al. 2014:27-29).  The CIA study area includes established neighborhoods and communities associated with the City of South Lake Tahoe, Stateline CDP, and Douglas County, Nevada. No neighborhoods or community areas outside of the CIA study area boundary were identified as being sensitive to direct or indirect impacts from project implementation. Indicators of Community Character and Cohesion “Community character” and “cohesion” are terms that describe the degree to which a neighborhood exhibits a sense of community and the level of commitment the residents have for the neighborhood. Cohesion refers to the degree of interaction among neighbors, groups, and institutions. Cohesion can be demonstrated through a combination of indicators: length of residency, household size, frequency of personal contact, ethnicity, community activity, stay-at-home parents, age of residents, and community facilities that may provide social opportunities or health and welfare amenities (Caltrans 2011). Demographic data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau, including the American Community Survey, and included in the CIA and Relocation Study were used to characterize community cohesion. Indicators of a community with a high degree of cohesion have the following characteristics:  long average residency tenures: long-term residents are likely to feel more connected;  households of two or more people: a high percentage of single-person households tends to correlate with lower cohesion;  frequent personal contact;  ethnic homogeneity;  large amount of community activity;  stay-at-home parents: a possible indicator of community activity;  age: as with stay-at-home parents, elderly residents tend to be more active in their community because they often have time available to become involved;  number of community facilities; and   transit-dependent population: residents who walk or use public transportation for travel tend to engage in social interactions with each other more frequently than residents who travel by automobile.     Exhibit 3.4-1 Community Impact Assessment Study Area   Race and Ethnicity Racial minorities comprise a larger proportion of the population in the CIA study area than in Douglas County, the City of South Lake Tahoe, and the Stateline CDP. Hispanics/Latinos comprise a larger share of the population than other minority groups. The Relocation Study (TTD 2012) was prepared for the portion of the City of South Lake Tahoe that would be directly affected by the project; the Relocation Study assessed effects on a more focused area than the CIA study area listed in Table 3.4-1 and defined in the CIA (FHWA et al. 2014). Survey results summarized in the Relocation Study identified a substantial number of homes—more than 20 of the 84 survey respondents—in which Tagalog, Visayan, and Ilocano are spoken (all languages native to the Philippines). Survey results for this area also confirmed that a substantial number of these households contain Hispanic/Latino residents. The CIA study area contains a larger minority population, consisting of Hispanic/Latinos and Filipinos, than Douglas County, the City of South Lake Tahoe, and the Stateline CDP. Minority populations compose over half (54.8 percent) of the residents of the CIA study area.  Housing Occupancy Housing units occupied by owners in the CIA study area make up more than 36 percent of the total housing units, and tenant-occupied housing units make up more than 63 percent of the total housing units (see Table 3.4-2). Approximately 50 percent of the CIA study area housing units are vacant. The proportion of owner-occupied housing units in the CIA study area is lower than the proportion of owner-occupied housing units in Douglas County and the City of South Lake Tahoe, but is greater than that in the Stateline CDP. The proportion of tenant-occupied housing units in the CIA study area is greater than that in the City of South Lake Tahoe and Douglas County, but is lower than that in the Stateline CDP. The proportion of vacant units in the CIA study area is similar to that in the City of South Lake Tahoe, but is higher than that in Douglas County and the Stateline CDP. Not all vacant housing in the City of South Lake Tahoe, Douglas County, Stateline CDP, and CIA study area is affordable or available to people who would like to live and work in these areas. As described in the City of South Lake Tahoe Housing Element Background Report, the reason is because a large proportion (78.8 percent in the City of South Lake Tahoe as of 2010) of the vacant housing is considered vacant for seasonal, recreational, or occasional use (City of South Lake Tahoe 2014:4-16 – 4-17). In 2010, approximately 15 percent of vacant homes were available for rent and approximately 3 percent were available for sale (City of South Lake Tahoe 2014:4-17). Similar vacancy data for Douglas County, Stateline CDP, and the CIA study area was not readily available, but it is widely understood that these other areas within the Tahoe Basin experience similar shortages of rental vacancies and it is reasonable to assume that these areas experience similar vacancy statistics as the City of South Lake Tahoe.  Elderly Residents Elderly residents in the CIA study area make up 7 percent of the total population (see Table 3.4-2). The proportion of the population in the CIA study area that is elderly is lower than the proportion of the population of elderly residents in the City of South Lake Tahoe and Douglas County. The proportion of the population in the CIA study area that is elderly is similar to that in the Stateline CDP. Survey results summarized in the Relocation Study (TTD 2012) identified seven households with elderly residents. Household Size Household size in the CIA study area averages 2.28 people per household, which is similar to that in the Stateline CDP and is lower than the average household size in Douglas County and the City of South Lake Tahoe (see Table 3.4-2).  Commuting Patterns Workers who live in the CIA study area and who walk, bike, or take transit to work make up 21 percent of the working population (see Table 3.4-2). The proportion of the population that walks, bikes, or takes transit to work in the CIA study area is similar to that in the Stateline CDP and is greater than the corresponding portion of the working population in Douglas County and the City of South Lake Tahoe. Housing Tenure The CIA study area contains a lower proportion of long-term residents than the proportion of long-term residents living in Douglas County and the City of South Lake Tahoe (see Table 3.4-2).  Table 3.4-1 Ethnic Composition of the CIA Study Area (2014)  Area  Hispanic/ Latino  Black or African American  American Indian/ Alaska Native  Asian  Native Hawaiian/ Other Pacific Islander  Some Other Race/Two or More Races  Total Population  Total Minority Population (Percent)  City of South Lake Tahoe  6,916  294  153  988  14  562  21,394  8,927 (41.7)  Douglas County  5,470  200  881  555  70  1,335  47,135  8,511 (18.1)  Stateline CDP  432  0  0  10  8  72  1,017  522 (51.3)  CIA Study Area  2,528  131  0  477  9  303  6,288  3,448 (54.8)  Source: U.S. Census Bureau 2015c    Table 3.4-2 Community Cohesion Indicators (2014)  Area  Total Population  Total Housing Units  Owner-Occupied Residences (percent of total housing units)  Tenant-Occupied Residences (percent of total housing units)  Occupied Housing Units (percent of total housing units)  Vacant Housing Units  Average Household Size  Long-Term Residents 1 (percent of total occupied units)  Elderly Residents2 (percent of total population)  Workers 16 Years and Over (percent of total population)  Non-Auto-Dependent Population3 (percent of workers)  City of South Lake Tahoe  21,394  16,337  3,940 (45.9)  4,645 (54.1)  8,585 (52.6)  7,752 (47.5)  2.45  2,388 (27.8)  3,421 (16.0)  10,556 (49.3)  1,679 (15.9)  Douglas County  47,135  23,677  14,050 (71.1)  5,715 (28.9)  19,765 (83.5)  3,912 (16.5)  2.40  5,927 (30.0)  13,029 (27.6)  20,387 (43.3)  598 (2.9)  Stateline CDP  1,017  454  82 (19.5)  338 (80.5)  420 (92.5)  34 (7.5)  2.27  60 (14.3)  67 (6.6)  601 (59.1)  154 (25.6)  CIA Study Area  7,862  6,306  1,186 (36.4)  2,072 (63.6)  3,258 (51.7)  3,048 (48.3)  2.28  746 (22.9)  570 (7.3)  3,589 (45.6)  764 (21.3)  1 Includes those residents who moved into their current residence in 1999 or earlier. 2 Persons 62 years or older. 3 Methods of transportation to work include walking, biking, and public transportation. Source: U.S. Census Bureau 2015a, 2015b, 2015d, 2015e, 2015g   Economy and Employment The South Shore economy relies heavily on tourism and visitor services jobs, which provide more than 50 percent of the South Shore area’s total employment, through accommodations and food service; retail; and arts, entertainment, and recreation (see Table 3.4-3). In 2002, there were 18,670 employees in the South Shore area. The Economic Analysis of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project Report defines the South Shore as including all of the City of South Lake Tahoe, unincorporated El Dorado County within the Tahoe Basin, and the portion of Douglas County that contains Stateline, Round Hill, Zephyr Cove, and Glenbrook (TTD 2013:10). By 2014, there were 14,999 employees in the South Shore area, a loss of approximately 3,600 jobs in 12 years. Most of these jobs have been lost on the Nevada side of the state line, although the California side experienced a substantial loss during this period as well. By far, the largest segment to suffer losses was the accommodations and food service segment, which lost more than 3,300 jobs. Table 3.4-3 Employment by Industry, South Shore Area  Industry  2002  2014  Total Employed  Percentage of Total (percent)  Total Employed  Percentage of Total (percent)  Accommodation and Food Service  9,422  50.5  6,033  40.2  Retail Trade  1,486  8.0  1,122  7.5  Health Care and Social Assistance  1,273  6.8  1,191  7.9  Educational Services  1,194  6.4  960  6.4  Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation  1,064  5.7  1,519  10.1  Construction  680  3.6  434  2.9  Other Services (excluding Public Administration)  582  3.1  548  3.7  Public Administration  504  2.7  554  3.7  Real Estate and Rental and Leasing  496  2.7  413  2.8  Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services  584  3.1  416  2.8  Administration & Support, Waste Management and Remediation  374  2.0  801  5.3  Transportation and Warehousing  194  1.0  127  0.8  Utilities  187  1.0  272  1.8  Finance and Insurance  188  1.0  171  1.1  Wholesale Trade  165  0.9  219  1.5  Information  147  0.8  104  0.7  Manufacturing  117  0.6  49  0.3  Management of Companies and Enterprises  13  0.1  57  0.4  Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, Hunting, and Mining  0  0  6  0.04  Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction  0  0  3  0.02  Total  18,670  100  14,999  100.0  Source: U.S. Census Bureau 2016  Employment Rate Within the CIA study area, the unemployment rate is 5.0 percent (Table 3.4-4).

In the CIA study area, 16 percent of the population is living below the poverty level (Table 3.4-5). The CIA study area contains a greater proportion of the population living below the poverty level than do Douglas County and the Stateline CDP. The CIA study area’s proportion of the population living below the poverty level is similar to the City of South Lake Tahoe as a whole. Table 3.4-5 Poverty Level  Area  2014 Population  Population Living Below Poverty Level  Population Living Below Poverty Level (percent)  City of South Lake Tahoe  21,394  3,900  18.2  Douglas County  47,135  4,910  10.4  Stateline CDP  1,017  114  11.2  CIA Study Area  7,862  1,254  16.0  Notes: The data gathered for the CIA study area are for the census tract level. The data represents Census Tract 316 of El Dorado County South Lake Tahoe and Census Tracts 17 and 18 of Douglas County, Nevada Stateline Area.  The population of each area described in this table differ from other population data in this document. The population information presented in this table are U.S. Census Bureau 2012 data for each location, whereas population information for each area presented elsewhere in this document are from U.S. Census Bureau 2010 data. Source: U.S. Census Bureau 2015f  Jobs-to-Housing Ratio Lack of sufficient housing may impede economic growth by increasing the price of available housing, making it difficult for companies to attract new employees and requiring families that seek affordable housing to move farther away from the communities in which they work. Conversely, lack of sufficient jobs may force residents to commute long distances to outside employment centers. These potential mismatches are referred to as a jobs-to-housing imbalance. It is generally considered ideal to have a jobs-to-housing balance of approximately one job per housing unit in a jurisdiction.  The City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan Housing Element provides information about the jobs-to-housing ratio within the city and county (Table 3.4-6). In 2010, the jobs-to-housing ratio was 0.8 in the city and 1.0 in the county. This indicates that within the city, there are fewer jobs than available housing. Within the county, the amount of jobs and demand for housing is balanced. The number of housing units identified in Table 3.4-6 represent the total units, regardless of their status as owner-occupied, renter-occupied, or vacation rental; therefore, the jobs-to-housing ratio for housing only used by permanent residents could be greater than what is shown in the table.   Table 3.4-6 Jobs-to-Housing Ratio    South Lake Tahoe  El Dorado County  2000  2010  2000  2010  Housing Units  14,050   15,087   71,278  88,159  Employed Residents  11,953  12,223  73,821  84,829  Jobs Housing Ratio  0.9  0.8  1.0  1.0  Source: City of South Lake Tahoe 2014:4-22  Community Facilities Community facilities include schools, libraries, recreation facilities, health care providers, emergency services, places of worship, community centers, boys and girls clubs, and similar institutions. These facilities can contribute to community cohesion because they provide residents with opportunities to interact with other members of their community. Community facilities in the CIA study area include:  First Baptist Church of South Lake Tahoe, 1053 Wildwood Ave, South Lake Tahoe, CA;  Barton Urgent Care and Family Practice, 155 US 50, Stateline, NV;  Kahle Community Center, 236 Kingsbury Grade Road, Stateline, NV;  Stateline Branch Post Office, 223 Kingsbury Grade Road, Stateline, NV; and  Tahoe Community Church, 145 Daggett Way, Stateline, NV. No community facilities would be directly affected by the project. Summary As described above, the CIA study area is characterized by greater community cohesion, based on some of the indicators (e.g., minority population and transit-dependent population), compared to the whole of Douglas County, the City of South Lake Tahoe, and the Stateline CDP. More than 54 percent of the residential population in the CIA study area consists of minorities, with the largest number of minorities identifying as Hispanic/Latino or Asian, which includes Filipino. Almost 20 percent of the population live on an income below the poverty line. Approximately 50 percent of the housing units in the CIA study area are vacant. About 29 percent of residents have lived in the CIA study area for a long period (i.e., since 1999 or earlier), indicating high turnover of residents. No community facilities (e.g., church, park, or community center) that would be directly affected by the project. Because the CIA study area contains a concentrated population of minorities and is characterized by a population that is more dependent on transit than exists elsewhere in the City of South Lake Tahoe, Douglas County, and the Stateline CDP, the CIA study area is determined to have a moderate degree of community cohesion. The CIA study area residents are recognized as having a higher proportion of minorities and lower levels of income than the surrounding areas.  ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES Methods and Assumptions Community Character and Cohesion The CIA study area included all census tracts within and adjacent to the project site. The evaluation of potential temporary and permanent impacts on community cohesion is based on a review of U.S. Census data related to indicators for community cohesion, including race (to determine ethnic homogeneity of the neighborhood), residents’ tenure, and commuting patterns. Windshield surveys and surveys with residents were conducted to obtain information about the type of land uses and community characteristics that exist in the CIA study area. The affected environment data were reviewed and summarized to provide an understanding of existing conditions and to identify potential environmental effects, based on the significance criteria and guidance provided by the Caltrans Standard Environmental Reference (SER) for preparation of a joint EIR/EIS document. The impact evaluation considers the effect of each alternative on community cohesion in the CIA study area, as it relates to the significance criteria listed below. Construction Employees Construction employee demand estimates for the project transportation improvements and the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, were generated based on assumptions used in the air quality modeling conducted using California Emissions Estimator Model (CalEEMod), such as the duration of each construction phase and numbers of associated vehicle trips (modeled by Ascent Environmental, Inc. in 2016).  Construction of replacement housing, whether at the locations identified for the mixed-use development or elsewhere, would occur prior to breaking ground for the transportation improvements in California. Estimating more specifically the timing of construction for each of the mixed-use development sites would be speculative. To provide a conservative estimate of the maximum number of construction workers generated by the mixed-use development this analysis assumes that a maximum of two mixed-use development sites could be developed simultaneously.  Mixed-Use Development Population Based on the proposed US 50 realignment and associated improvements identified for Alternatives B, C, and D and the options for mixed-use development, which would provide some or all of the replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other multi-family or commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant), this analysis assumes that these alternatives with mixed-use development could generate additional population and new employment. The estimate of additional housing units and population takes into account the units that would provide replacement housing for residents displaced by Alternatives B, C, and D (see Table 3.4-7). The locations of displaced housing units under each alternative are identified in Exhibits 3.4-2, 3.4-3, and 3.4-4. Table 3.4-7 Mixed-Use Development Population   Alternative  Proposed Housing Units  Total Displaced Units  Housing Unit Net Increase*  Population Generation Rate (persons/household)  Population Increase  A: No Build (No Project)  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action)  227  88  139  2.28  317  C: Triangle One-Way  227  83  144  2.28  333  D: PSR Alternative 2  224  78  146  2.28  337  E: Skywalk   NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  *Net increase in housing units is the difference between proposed units and displaced units. NA = not applicable Source: Based on U.S. Census Bureau 2015g, adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2016  Mixed-Use Development Employment At the time of publication of this Draft EIR/EIS/EIS, the exact mix of uses is unknown but could consist of up to 46,250 square feet (sq. ft.) of commercial floor area (CFA) for Alternatives B and C and up to 48,000 sq. ft. for Alternative D. Therefore, a range of average full-time equivalent (FTE) employees was calculated for the mixed-use development based on the range of types of businesses that could occur (Tables 3.4-8 and 3.4-9). When a specific project is proposed to carry forward the mixed-use development, additional project-level environmental review would be required to assess the potential increase in employees. Table 3.4-8 Employee Generation Rates  Commercial Uses  Square Feet/Employee  Service  172  Retail  600  Recreation/Other  273  Source: Modeled by TRPA using the 2015 Transportation Demand Model     Exhibit 3.4-2 Alternative B: Triangle – Right-of-Way and Potential Mixed-Use Development –  Full and Partial Acquisitions  Exhibit 3.4-3 Alternative C: Triangle One-Way – Right-of-Way and Potential Mixed-Use Development –  Full and Partial Acquisitions   Exhibit 3.4-4 Alternative D: PSR Alternative 2 – Right-of-Way and Potential Mixed-Use Development –  Full and Partial Acquisitions Table 3.4-9 Permanent Employment Generated by Mixed-Use Development    Maximum CFA (square feet)  Minimum Number of Employees1  Maximum Number of Employees2  A: No Build (No Project)  NA  NA  NA  B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action)  46,250  77  269  C: Triangle One-Way  46,250  77  269  D: PSR Alternative 2  48,000  80  279  E: Skywalk   NA  NA  NA  1 The minimum number of employees was generated based on the highest employee generation rate for commercial uses shown in Table 3.4-8. 2 The maximum number of employees was generated based on the lowest employee generation rate for commercial uses shown in Table 3.4-8. NA = not applicable Source: Compiled by Ascent Environmental in 2016  For this analysis, the following assumptions have been used to estimate the potential employment numbers for the multi-family residential and mixed-use commercial uses that would comprise the potential development:  Multi-family residential: The multi-family residential units are anticipated to be owned by an existing private company that provides property management and maintenance services; additional employees would not be required.  Mixed-use commercial: As described in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives,” the mixed-use commercial uses could include retail, restaurants, neighborhood commercial uses, and visitor services. Employment generated by these uses would likely be higher during winter and summer seasons than in the shoulder seasons. Employee generation rates used in the 2015 TRPA Transportation Demand Model (Table 3.4-8) were used to determine a minimum and maximum number of employees that could be generated by the mixed-use development (Table 3.4-9). The mixed-use development is estimated to generate between 80 and 269 FTE employees depending on the total amount of commercial floor area (CFA), mix of commercial uses, and the alternative (see Table 3.4-9). This assumes the minimum and maximum employment levels for each alternative and housing options. Significance Criteria NEPA Criteria The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended, established that the federal government use all practicable means to ensure that all Americans have safe, healthful, productive, and aesthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings (42 USC 4331[b][2]). FHWA, in its implementation of NEPA (23 USC 109[h]), directs that final decisions on projects are to be made in the best overall public interest. This requires taking into account adverse environmental impacts, such as destruction or disruption of human-made resources, impacts on community cohesion, and the availability of public facilities and services. TRPA Criteria The “Population” criteria from the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist were used to evaluate the population impacts of the build alternatives. The project would result in a significant impact if it would:  alter the location, distribution, density, or growth rate of the human population planned for the Region. CEQA Criteria Under CEQA, an economic or social change by itself is not considered a significant effect on the environment. However, if a social or economic change is related to a physical change, then that social or economic change may be considered in determining whether the physical change is significant. Because this project would result in physical changes to the environment, it is appropriate to consider changes to community character and cohesion in assessing the significance of the project’s effects. In accordance with Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines, an alternative was determined to result in a significant impact related to community character and cohesion, as it relates to land use, if it would:   physically divide an established community; or  induce substantial population growth in an area, either directly or indirectly. ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF THE PROJECT ALTERNATIVES Impact 3.4-1: Physically divide an established community causing changes to community character and cohesion With implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements, US 50 would be rerouted through an established neighborhood (generally known as Rocky Point), which is characterized as having moderate community cohesion due to the presence of a concentrated minority population and transit-dependent population. The highway realignment and physical division of the neighborhood would change the character and cohesiveness of the neighborhood by displacing residents and substantially changing the visual character and ambient noise environment (see Sections 3.7, “Visual Resources/Aesthetics” and 3.15, “Noise and Vibration”). The realigned US 50 would create a physical barrier restricting pedestrian access across the new highway alignment, although vehicular connectivity through the neighborhood would be maintained. Increased trip lengths for pedestrians and bicyclists in this neighborhood would in part be offset by the enhanced bicycle and pedestrian features (e.g., sidewalk and bicycle lane) along the new highway. These three alternatives would physically divide residences within the Rocky Point neighborhood from each other, and for those residents southwest of the realigned highway from the adjacent commercial and tourist core area. Residents and businesses would be displaced by right-of-way acquisition. (Note: displacement is discussed further in Impact 3.4-4.) Considering these impact influences together, the physical division of an established community caused by the Alternatives B, C, and D realignment of US 50 would result in adverse changes in the character and cohesiveness of a residential neighborhood.  The mixed-use development sites associated with Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, are the preferred locations for construction of replacement housing for residents displaced by the project. Implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would include new buildings that are consistent in character to other existing, newer development, would replace hotel units with housing units and commercial uses that would contribute to a stronger sense of community, and would not physically divide an established neighborhood. For these reasons, these alternatives with mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not result in any adverse changes in the character and cohesiveness of a residential neighborhood beyond those associated with the Alternatives B, C, and D. Because Alternative A would include no changes and Alternative E would not include project components located within an established neighborhood community, these alternatives would not adversely affect community character or cohesion or disrupt or divide an established community.  NEPA Environmental Consequences:  Mitigation Measure 3.4-1 has been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to physical division of an established community and associated adverse changes in the character and cohesiveness of a residential neighborhood; No Impact for Alternatives A and E CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Significant and Unavoidable for Alternatives B, C, and D after implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.4-1; No Impact for Alternatives A and E The new US 50 alignment associated with Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would be constructed through the Rocky Point neighborhood southwest of the Heavenly Village Center and would directly affect this neighborhood (see Section 3.4.2 for a discussion of displacement and relocation). The residences in this neighborhood include single-family residences, multi-family apartment buildings, and duplexes. Many of the residents in this neighborhood work in the nearby tourist core and the surrounding commercial area. Several hotel/motels are also located along Pioneer Trail to the west. The roads that provide access in this neighborhood are two-lane roads with two-way stop signs at the intersections. These roads provide access to Montreal Road and Lake Parkway, which move traffic behind the tourist core. As discussed under “Existing Transportation Facilities” in Section 3.6.2, these local roads are heavily used as faster, “cut-through” routes to access Lake Parkway East from Pioneer Trail, bypassing US 50 through the tourist core. Because of the large volume of cut-through traffic, these local roadways experience higher-than-typical daily traffic volumes and speeds. The Rocky Point neighborhood exhibits some characteristics of community cohesion, including a concentrated minority population and a transit-dependent population, that comprise a higher proportion of the population compared to Douglas County, the City of South Lake Tahoe, and the Stateline CDP. More than 54 percent of the residential population in the CIA study area belong to a minority ethnic group. The proportion of the population for other community cohesion indicators in the study area are lower, with a high rate of resident turnover and a vacancy rate of 50 percent, characteristic of a large number of vacation rentals and second homes and contributing to lower community cohesion (see Table 3.4-2). However, the concentrated minority population in the Rocky Point neighborhood indicates the likelihood that community cohesion is present in the neighborhood affected by the project. For these reasons, this neighborhood is considered to have a moderate degree of community cohesion. The types of project activities that could adversely affect community character and cohesion are those that reduce opportunities for community interactions, including loss of communal areas, barriers that divide the neighborhood or limit access to parts of the neighborhood, and changes to the environment that affect the quality of social interactions (e.g., increased noise or pollution). Physical division of an established community could result from construction of a barrier that changes the connectivity between portions of a community. The division would result in a significant impact if it would change the connectivity such that individuals in one portion of the community would be separated from the rest of the community. Examples of this type of impact include closure of a bridge or roadway or construction of a storm channel that would result in the loss of a transportation route such as a roadway, pedestrian path, or bicycle path. Implementation of any of the build alternatives could alter existing access routes. Permanent effects on the physical division of the community, community character, and cohesion of the Rocky Point neighborhood are discussed below. Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Because Alternative A would maintain the existing US 50 alignment and would not result in any other improvements that would result in effects on residents or businesses adjacent to the roadway, this alternative would not adversely affect community character or cohesion or disrupt or divide an established community. There would be no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements With Alternative B transportation improvements, the new US 50 alignment would bisect the Rocky Point neighborhood, a moderately cohesive residential community, and displace single and multi-family residences, hotel/motels, and businesses. (Note: displacement is discussed further in Impact 3.4-4.) The community would be split in two, and residents southwest of the highway would be physically separated from the adjacent commercial properties and downtown area.  The highway realignment and physical division of the neighborhood would change the character and cohesiveness of the neighborhood by displacing residents, and substantially changing the visual character and ambient noise environment (see Sections 3.7, “Visual Resources/Aesthetics,” and 3.15, “Noise and Vibration”). The division of the neighborhood would also increase pedestrian trip lengths for residents southwest of the highway trying to access shopping and adjacent commercial properties after first walking to either the new Pioneer Trail/US 50 intersection or the new Heavenly Village Way/US 50 intersection. The current average trip length for residents in this area (midpoint between Pioneer Trail and Heavenly Village Way) is 0.15 mile, and with Alternative B, it would increase to about 0.25 mile. This increased distance would in part be offset by the enhanced bicycle and pedestrian features (e.g., sidewalk and bicycle lane) along the realigned highway. Considering these factors together, the physical division of an established community caused by the Alternative B realignment of US 50 would result in adverse changes in the character and cohesiveness of a residential neighborhood, which would be a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to physical division of an established community and the associated adverse changes in the character and cohesiveness of a residential neighborhood. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Implementation of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, associated with Alternative B would result in new mixed-use development in the northwest and northeast corners of the new US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection (Sites 1 and 2 in Exhibit 2-9) and behind the Heavenly Village Center (Site 3 in Exhibit 2-9). Site 1 would involve development in the area northeast of the Tahoe Meadows Historic District, an established private neighborhood surrounded by a fence. Site 2 would involve development in the area between existing US 50 and the existing Rocky Point neighborhood south of the Heavenly Village Center. Site 3 would involve development on an existing parking lot behind Raley’s grocery store.  The mixed-use development, including replacement housing, associated with Alternative B would introduce several buildings up to three stories tall in locations that are surrounded by commercial and residential uses. At Site 1, the mixed-use development would replace several older commercial buildings and would maintain and extend the Linear Park along the western edge of the site. The mixed-use development at Site 1 would be physically and visually separated from the Tahoe Meadows Historic District by the Linear Park and existing wrought iron fence; it would replace older commercial development with newer buildings that are consistent in character with other surrounding uses, such as the Holiday Inn Express. At Site 2, the mixed-use development would replace older hotels and apartment buildings along Pioneer Trail with buildings up to three stories tall that are similar in character to other surrounding uses, such as the Heavenly Village Center. Development of Site 2 would introduce buildings that are slightly taller than the existing two-story buildings, but would improve the community character of the neighborhood by replacing hotel units with housing units and commercial uses that would contribute to a stronger sense of community. Site 3 would introduce mixed-use development in an area that is primarily surrounded by commercial development and open space. New development at Site 3 would enhance community character in this area by expanding the existing neighborhood into an area that currently contains no residences. Additionally, the mixed-use development could add new amenities, such as a convenience store or restaurant, that could help maintain community character and cohesion in this neighborhood.  The mixed-use development at Sites 1, 2, and 3 would be located at the edge of existing neighborhoods and would not create a physical barrier that would divide these established neighborhoods. The access to Tahoe Meadows via Lodge Road and access to the Holiday Inn Express would be maintained through Site 1. Development of Site 2 would extend Fern Road to existing US 50 to ensure adequate access for Site 2 and the existing neighborhood to existing US 50. An access point would also be created at Primrose Road and the north side of realigned US 50. Because development at the three mixed-use development sites would maintain circulation and would not create a physical barrier within an existing development, the mixed-use development component of Alternative B would not physically divide an established community. The mixed-use development at Sites 1, 2, and 3 are the preferred location to construct replacement housing for residents displaced by the realigned US 50 roadway. These three sites are close to the existing neighborhood and provide an opportunity for displaced residents to remain within or directly adjacent to the existing neighborhood. Additionally, the commercial uses at these sites could increase the opportunities for neighborhood-serving commercial uses to be located near residents in the area. As described in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives,” the mixed-use development sites are the preferred location for replacement housing constructed by the project; therefore, the mixed-use development sites provide an opportunity to locate housing near jobs and transit that could be utilized by residents displaced by the project. (Note: displacement is discussed further in Impact 3.4-4.)  The mixed-use development, including replacement housing, of Alternative B could enhance the community character of the neighborhood by expanding the existing neighborhood into some areas that currently contain no residences. For these reasons, mixed-use development, including replacement housing, of Alternative B would not physically divide an established community and, thus, would not result in additional adverse changes in the character and cohesiveness of a residential neighborhood beyond those described above for Alternative B transportation improvements. For these reasons, this impact of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, portion of Alternative B would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize physical division of an established neighborhood and associated adverse changes in community character and cohesiveness such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for physical division of an established neighborhood causing changes in community character and cohesiveness as described for the replacement housing on the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential physical division of an established neighborhood impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a significant impact on physical division of an established neighborhood causing changes in community character and cohesiveness. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into construction of the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the physical division of an established neighborhood causing changes in community character and cohesiveness. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements The roadway alignment for Alternative C is the same as that for Alternative B. However, Alternative C would divide eastbound and westbound directions on US 50 from the US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection in California to the US 50/Lake Parkway intersection in Nevada. This modification would result in Alternative C having a smaller right-of-way (ROW) footprint for the realigned US 50. Alternative C transportation improvements would result in similar impacts to Alternative B on the neighborhood associated with changing the character and cohesiveness of the neighborhood by physically dividing the neighborhood and displacing residents, and substantially changing the visual character and ambient noise environment (see Sections 3.7, “Visual Resources/Aesthetics” and 3.15, “Noise and Vibration”). Additionally, the division of the neighborhood would increase pedestrian trip lengths for residents southwest of the highway that would need to access shopping and adjacent commercial properties after first walking to either the new Pioneer Trail/US 50 intersection or the new Heavenly Village Way/US 50 intersection. The changes in trip length associated with dividing this neighborhood would in part be offset by the enhanced bicycle and pedestrian features (e.g., sidewalk and bicycle lane) along the new highway.  Considering these factors together, the physical division of an established community caused by the Alternative C realignment of US 50 would result in adverse changes in the character and cohesiveness of a residential neighborhood, which would be a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to physical division of an established community and the associated adverse changes in the character and cohesiveness of a residential neighborhood. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Implementation of mixed-use development, including replacement housing, associated with Alternative C would include the same sites and sizes of mixed-use development, including number of stories and housing units, as described above for Alternative B. Additionally, the mixed-use development sites are the preferred location for replacement housing constructed by the project; therefore, the mixed-use development sites provide an opportunity to locate housing near jobs and transit that could be used by residents displaced by the project and relocated to replacement housing constructed at one of these sites. For these reasons, mixed-use development, including replacement housing, of Alternative C would have the same impacts on community character, physical division of an established community, and community cohesion as described above for Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing.  Mixed-use development including replacement housing associated with Alternative C could enhance the community character of the neighborhood by expanding the existing neighborhood into some areas that currently contain no residences. For these reasons, the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, component of Alternative C would not physically divide an established community and, thus, would not result in any associated adverse changes in the character and cohesiveness of a residential neighborhood beyond those described above for Alternative C transportation improvements. For these reasons, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would avoid or minimize physical division of an established neighborhood and associated adverse changes in community character and cohesiveness such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for physical division of an established neighborhood causing changes in community character and cohesiveness as described for the replacement housing on the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential physical division of an established neighborhood impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a significant impact on physical division of an established neighborhood causing changes in community character and cohesiveness. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into construction of the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the physical division of an established neighborhood causing changes in community character and cohesiveness.  Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements The roadway alignment for Alternative D is similar to that for Alternative B, with the section of realigned US 50 between the US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection and Montreal Road located closer to the Heavenly Village Center and situated between Echo Road and Fern Road instead of along Moss Road.  Alternative D would result in similar impacts to those from Alternative B on the neighborhood associated with changing the character and cohesiveness of the neighborhood by displacing residents, and substantially changing the visual character and ambient noise environment (see Sections 3.7, “Visual Resources/Aesthetics” and 3.15, “Noise and Vibration”).  The remnant residences north of the realigned highway would become a single residential street isolated from the rest of the Rocky Point neighborhood. The residential street would become surrounded on two sides by high-volume traffic on the realigned US 50 and Lake Tahoe Boulevard and on the third side by the rear parking lot of the Heavenly Village Center. Similar to Alternatives B and C, Alternative D would have an adverse effect on community character and cohesiveness of the neighborhood. Vehicle access for the neighborhood bounded by the Heavenly Village Center and realigned US 50 would be provided by a right turn onto or from Fern Road. Vehicle circulation in the neighborhood south of the realigned US 50 would not change with Alternative D from existing conditions, with the exception of a new access point from Montreal Road onto the realigned US 50. Under Alternative D, the realigned US 50 would create a physical barrier that would prevent pedestrians from crossing the highway, except at new intersections that require a longer, more circuitous route.  Additionally, the division of the neighborhood by Alternative D would also increase pedestrian trip lengths for residents southwest of the highway that would need to access shopping and adjacent commercial properties after first walking to either the new Pioneer Trail/US 50 intersection or the new Heavenly Village Way/US 50 intersection. The changes in trip length associated with dividing this neighborhood would in part be offset by the enhanced bicycle and pedestrian features (e.g., sidewalk and bicycle lane) along the new highway.  Considering these factors together, the physical division of an established community caused by the Alternative D realignment of US 50 would result in adverse changes in the character and cohesiveness of a residential neighborhood, which would be a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to physical division of an established community and the associated adverse changes in the character and cohesiveness of a residential neighborhood.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Implementation of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, associated with Alternative D would result in new mixed-use development in the southwest and southeast corners of the new US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection (Sites 1A and 1B in Exhibit 2-11), the entire area between realigned US 50 and the Heavenly Village Center (Site 2 in Exhibit 2-11), and the existing parking lot behind Raley’s grocery store (Site 3 in Exhibit 2-11). The mixed-use development sites are the preferred location for replacement housing constructed by the project with this alternative; therefore, the mixed-use development sites provide an opportunity to locate housing near jobs and transit that could be utilized by residents displaced by the project. The addition of mixed-use development in Alternative D would introduce several buildings up to three stories tall in locations that are surrounded by commercial and residential uses, similar to Alternative B. However, unlike Alternatives B and C, Alternative D would not construct mixed-use development, including replacement housing, directly adjacent to the Linear Park and the Tahoe Meadows Historic District. The mixed-use development at Sites 1A, 1B, and 2 would replace older commercial, motel, and residential uses with newer buildings in character with other surrounding uses, such as the Heavenly Village Center and Holiday Inn Express. If Site 2 is developed, it could remove the homes on the one residential street that would be isolated from the rest of the Rocky Point neighborhood only after replacement housing has been constructed and residents to be displaced have been relocated. Site 3 would introduce mixed-use development, including replacement housing, in an area that is primarily surrounded by commercial development and open space. Similar to the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, associated with Alternative B, the mixed-use component of Alternative D at these locations would enhance the community character of the neighborhood by expanding the residential area and providing new commercial amenities. Similar to the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, associated with Alternative B, Alternative D mixed-use development at Sites 1A, 1B, 2, and 3 would be located at the edge of existing neighborhoods and would not result in a physical barrier that would divide these established neighborhoods. The emergency access to Tahoe Meadows on Lodge Road and access to the Holiday Inn Express would be maintained.  Development of Site 2 would extend Fern Road to existing US 50 to ensure adequate circulation from Site 2 and the existing neighborhood to existing US 50. An access point would also be created at Primrose Road and the north side of realigned US 50. Additionally, effects from construction of the realigned US 50 on division of an established community would be the same as those described above for Alternative D transportation improvements. Development at the three mixed-use development sites would maintain circulation and would not result in a physical barrier within an existing development. The mixed-use development, including replacement housing, associated with Alternative D could enhance the community character of the neighborhood by expanding the existing neighborhood into some areas that currently contain no residences. For these reasons, Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not physically divide an established community and, thus, would not result in adverse changes in the character and cohesiveness of a residential neighborhood beyond those described above for Alternative D transportation improvements. For these reasons, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would avoid or minimize physical division of an established neighborhood and associated adverse changes in community character and cohesiveness such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for physical division of an established neighborhood causing changes in community character and cohesiveness as described for the replacement housing on the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential physical division of an established neighborhood impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a significant impact on physical division of an established neighborhood causing changes in community character and cohesiveness. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into construction of the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the physical division of an established neighborhood causing changes in community character and cohesiveness. Alternative E: Skywalk Implementation of Alternative E would result in development of a raised concrete deck over the entire width and length of existing US 50 between Stateline Avenue and the northern end of the Montbleu Resort that would be utilized by pedestrians along the casino corridor. There are no residences within this area. No parcels containing residences or businesses would need to be required with implementation of Alternative E because the features of this alternative would be located within the existing ROW for US 50 through the tourist core. Consequently, Alternative E would not adversely affect community character or community cohesion or physically divide an established community. There would be no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Impact 3.4-2: Alter the location, distribution, or growth of the human population for the Region during construction Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would generate a temporary increase in employment in the South Shore of Lake Tahoe of approximately 80 construction jobs during construction of the transportation improvements. The maximum number of construction employees on-site at one time would be approximately 30 employees during the most intensive construction phase of the transportation improvements. For construction of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for Alternatives B, C, and D, these alternatives would generate approximately 90 construction jobs during the most intensive construction phase and would generate approximately 175 construction employees if two of the mixed-use development sites are constructed simultaneously. Construction of Alternative E would generate a temporary increase in employment of approximately 45 construction jobs with the maximum number of employees on-site at one time would be approximately 15 construction employees. The number of existing construction personnel in the study area and surrounding areas would be sufficient to meet demand associated with the build alternatives; therefore, this temporary increase in employment is not expected to generate substantial temporary population growth or generate the need for additional housing for construction workers. Therefore, Alternatives B, C, D, and E would not alter the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region.  Alternative A would not result in any new construction and, thus, would not increase demand for construction workers or result in an associated increase in housing demand during construction. Alternative A would not induce substantial population growth or housing demand in the Region during construction.  NEPA Environmental Consequences:  The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize effects related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the population during construction; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; No Impact for Alternative A Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Because Alternative A would maintain the existing US 50 alignment and would not make any other improvements that would generate the need for temporary construction employment, this alternative would not induce substantial population growth and housing demand during construction and would not induce substantial population growth or housing demand in the Region during construction. There would be no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Construction of the realigned US 50 and other transportation improvements, including demolition of existing structures, under Alternative B transportation improvements would take place over three construction seasons and would generate approximately 80 temporary construction jobs throughout all construction phases for the transportation improvements (modeled by Ascent Environmental, Inc. in 2016). However, the maximum estimated number of construction workers on-site during the most intensive phase of development (grading and excavation) and including concurrent haul trips would be approximately 30 construction workers. As shown in Table 3.4-3, 434 residents of the South Shore area were employed in the construction industry in 2014, which is reduced from 680 residents employed in construction in 2002. This number, coupled with the supply of construction workers in other areas within commute distance (e.g., El Dorado County, Douglas County, and Carson City) would be sufficient to meet the demand for construction workers that would be generated by Alternative B. Seasonal construction labor demand is a regular annual occurrence in the Region, because the schedule of ground-disturbing activities is limited by mountain weather and regulatory protections for water quality (the construction season is limited to between May and October). Because a sufficient supply of construction workers would be available in the local area, demand for temporary housing to accommodate construction workers would not increase. Because the local construction labor pool would be sufficient to serve construction needs for Alternative B, this alternative would not induce substantial population growth and would not create additional demand for housing. For these reasons, Alternative B transportation improvements would not alter the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the effects related to the location, distribution, or growth of the human population for the Region during construction such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Construction of the transportation improvements for Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in roughly the same demand for temporary construction workers as described for Alternative B transportation improvements. Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would require additional workers to construct the mixed-use buildings. At this time, this analysis assumes that construction of the mixed-use development would occur at some time after completion of the transportation improvements and not concurrently with construction of the transportation improvements. Construction of the mixed-use buildings would generate up to approximately 175 temporary construction jobs over approximately three construction seasons, assuming that up to two of the mixed-use development sites would be constructed simultaneously (modeled by Ascent Environmental, Inc. in 2016). However, the maximum estimated number of construction workers on-site during the most intensive phase of development and including haul trips would be approximately 90 construction workers. The supply of construction workers located in the South Shore area, Carson City, and Douglas County has sufficient capacity to supply temporary construction workers. Because a sufficient supply of construction workers would be available in the local area, demand for temporary housing to accommodate construction workers would not increase. Because the demand for temporary workers would be met by existing supply, the project would not induce substantial population growth and would not create additional demand for housing. For these reasons, Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not alter the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region during construction. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA, and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize the effects related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region during construction such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for effects related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region during construction as described for the replacement housing on the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of these effects would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region during construction. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would minimize the effects related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region during construction such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Alternative C transportation improvements would result in similar transportation improvements and a slightly smaller footprint compared to Alternative B transportation improvements. Construction of Alternative C would generate the same demand for construction workers as described for Alternative B transportation improvements above. For the same reasons described above, Alternative C transportation improvements would not induce substantial population growth from temporary construction jobs generated by the alternative and, thus, would not create additional demand for temporary housing. Alternative C transportation improvements would not alter the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the effects related to the location, distribution, or growth of the human population for the Region during construction such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would include the same types of mixed-use development as Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing. Construction of Alternative C would generate the same demand for temporary construction employees for construction of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development as described above for Alternative B. Alternative C would not induce substantial population growth from temporary construction jobs generated by the alternative and, thus, would not create additional demand for housing. For these reasons, Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not alter the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would avoid or minimize the effects related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region during construction such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for effects related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region during construction as described for the replacement housing on the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of these effects would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region during construction. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would minimize the effects related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region during construction such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements Alternative D transportation improvements would result in similar transportation improvements and footprint as Alternative B transportation improvements. Construction of Alternative D would generate the same demand for construction workers as Alternative B. For the same reasons described above, Alternative D transportation improvements would not induce substantial population growth from temporary construction jobs generated by the alternative and, thus, would not create additional demand for housing. Alternative D transportation improvements would not alter the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the effects related to the location, distribution, or growth of the human population for the Region during construction such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would include similar types of mixed-use development as Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing. Construction of Alternative D with mixed-use development would generate the same demand for temporary construction employees as described above. Alternative D would not induce substantial population growth from temporary construction jobs generated by the alternative and, thus, would not create additional demand for housing. For these reasons, Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not alter the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would avoid or minimize the effects related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region during construction such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for effects related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region during construction as described for the replacement housing on the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of these effects would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region during construction. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would minimize the effects related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region during construction such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative E: Skywalk Implementation of Alternative E would result in construction of a raised concrete deck over the entire width and length of existing US 50 between Stateline Avenue and the northern end of the Montbleu Resort. Construction of Alternative E is estimated to require approximately 45 construction workers over two construction seasons, but the maximum number of construction workers on-site during the most intensive phase of construction would be approximately 15 workers. As described above for Alternative B, there is a sufficient supply of construction workers in the South Shore and nearby areas to meet the demand for construction workers. For these reasons, Alternative E would not induce substantial population growth from temporary construction jobs generated by the alternative and, thus, would not create additional demand for housing. Alternative E would not alter the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative E would avoid or minimize the effects related to the location, distribution, or growth of the human population for the Region during construction such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Impact 3.4-3: Alter the location, distribution, or growth of the human population for the Region during operation Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements and Alternative E could result in additional road and facility maintenance needs during operation but would not generate demand for a substantial number of new employees. The transportation improvements do not include components that would increase population and, thus, would not generate additional demand for housing. Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements and Alternative E would not alter the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region. Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in the same needs for additional road and facility maintenance needs described for these alternatives transportation improvements. With development of new commercial and housing units associated with the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, Alternatives B, C, and D would generate a net increase of up to approximately 180 – 210 new jobs and an estimated net population increase of approximately 320 – 340 people (after accounting for replacement of housing and employment displaced by the project). The additional demand for employees would likely be met by existing residents in the South Shore area. Furthermore, the employment and population growth generated by the mixed-use development, including commercial and residential uses, has been planned for as part of the Regional Plan and the Tourist Core Area Plan. Thus, Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not alter the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region. Alternative A would not result in any changes to existing conditions that would increase housing demand. Alternative A would not alter the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region. NEPA Environmental Consequences:  The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize effects related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the population during operation; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; No Impact for Alternative A The location and distribution of development is heavily regulated in the Tahoe Region. Developers must be granted authorization for construction of new housing units, CFA, and tourist accommodation units (TAUs) through a limited number of allocations that are capped by the Regional Plan. The Regional Plan also provides a bonus unit incentive program that grants bonus allocations to applicants transferring development from rural or sensitive areas into urban centers (TRPA Code Chapter 51). New transfer incentives were adopted as part of the Regional Plan Update (TRPA 2012a:2-11, 2-20, 2-21, 7-6, 7-7), which were developed to promote infill, mixed land uses, redevelopment, and the transfer of existing development, development rights, and coverage into community centers. A portion of the project site is designated as a Town Center District within the Tourist Core Area Plan (TCAP) and South Shore Area Plan (SSAP; see Exhibit 3.2-1 in Section 3.2, “Land Use”), a district that is subject to the greatest transfer incentive ratios. As discussed previously, the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project is one of several transportation improvement projects included in the 2012 and 2017 Lake Tahoe Regional Transportations Plan (RTPs). In general, a RTP is developed through the use of growth forecasts as a means to accommodate a region’s mobility over a period of time. Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) do not have land use planning authority; however, construction of public facilities, such as transportation infrastructure projects, can influence the number and location of residences and places of employment in a community. Planning efforts in the Tahoe Region focus on encouraging patterns of more compact and densely developed community centers. The RTP was intended to further facilitate this land use pattern by establishing a safe, secure, efficient, and integrated transportation system that reduces reliance on the private automobile and provides mixed-mode facilities that serve community centers and travel between community centers. As a result, transportation projects were planned primarily around existing population centers. Transportation infrastructure projects in the RTP were designed to facilitate movement of people and goods, provide improved accessibility, and promote sustainable economic growth. Regional land use planning efforts in the Tahoe Region focus on controlled regional growth and improved environmental conditions. To this end, transportation projects were developed to further the land use pattern of moving development out of rural areas and into community centers by establishing a safe, secure, efficient, and integrated transportation system that reduces reliance on the private automobile and provides mixed-mode facilities that serve the transportation needs of the citizens and visitors of the Tahoe Region, particularly mobility within and between community centers. Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Alternative A would maintain the existing US 50 alignment and would not make any other improvements that would generate permanent employment. This alternative would not induce substantial population growth and housing demand and would not alter the existing location or distribution of population, employment, and housing in the Region. Implementation of Alternative A would not preclude future transportation improvements or redevelopment to occur within the project site in the future. There would be no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Implementation of Alternative B transportation improvements would be limited to construction of the realigned US 50 along with other transportation improvements through the tourist core. Relocation of displaced residents to deed-restricted affordable and moderate-income housing would not generate additional employment because those housing units are existing. With implementation of Alternative B, 14 jobs associated with displaced businesses identified in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives,” would be lost (see Impact 3.4-5 and Table 3.4-14 for further discussion of displaced businesses). No new permanent employment in addition to those needed for maintenance would be generated by Alternative B transportation improvements. Currently, the City of South Lake Tahoe maintains the local roads that would be replaced by the realigned US 50, including Montreal Road and Lake Parkway to the state line and Douglas County maintains Lake Parkway to the state line. Caltrans and the Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) maintain US 50 through the tourist core. Property owners in this area maintain the sidewalks in front of their businesses. The relocation of US 50 and the redesignation of the existing US 50 as a local roadway would shift the responsibility for maintenance of these roads. Caltrans and NDOT would be responsible for maintaining the realigned US 50 behind the casinos, including the new retaining wall along Van Sickle Bi-State Park. Caltrans would be responsible for maintaining the underside of the pedestrian bridge. The California Tahoe Conservancy would be responsible for maintaining the new pedestrian walkway between Bellamy Court and the pedestrian bridge. The City of South Lake Tahoe and Douglas County would be responsible for maintaining the existing US 50, which would be redesignated as a local roadway. Property owners would continue to be responsible for maintaining the sidewalks in front of their businesses. Although implementation of Alternative B would result in expansion of these sidewalks, demand for new maintenance employees could be met by existing residents in the area. For these reasons, implementation of Alternative B transportation improvements would not generate substantial additional maintenance work such that a substantial number of additional employees would be required. Because any additional maintenance employment generated by the project could be met by existing residents, an increase in housing demand associated with road maintenance employment would not be anticipated. Implementation of Alternative B transportation improvements would not generate a substantial number of new employees during operation and would not include components that would increase population; thus, it would not generate additional demand for housing. Alternative B transportation improvements would also not include any other project components, such as extension of new utility lines, additional roads, additional residential and commercial uses, that could indirectly induce population growth that would generate additional demand for housing. For these reasons, Alternative B transportation improvements would not induce any permanent population growth or housing demand during operation and would not substantially alter the location and distribution of population, employment, and housing in the Region. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the effects related to the location, distribution, or growth of the human population for the Region during operation such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Implementation of Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would generate the same demand for maintenance employees as described above. Potential mixed-use development would generate additional demand for up to 269 employees associated with new commercial uses (Table 3.4-9), as well as up to 227 new housing units. Implementation of this alternative would displace up to 88 housing units, but would also result in a net increase of up to 177 jobs, 139 housing units, and 317 residents (see Table 3.4-7). This increase in residential population would represent a 4 percent increase in the CIA study area population and a 1.5 percent increase in the City of South Lake Tahoe population. The increase in additional employment generated by Alternative B with mixed-use development could lead to an increase in population growth and subsequent housing demand within the South Shore area and a change in the location and distribution of population, employment, and housing in the Region. The 77 to 269 new jobs created by implementation of Alternative B with mixed-use development would offset the loss of 92 jobs displaced by construction of the realigned US 50 and new mixed-use development (see Impact 3.4-5 and Table 3.4-14 for further discussion of displaced businesses). The mixed-use development would include deed-restricted affordable housing and market-rate housing that could serve some of these employees. As shown in Table 3.4-4, the unemployment rate in the South Shore area ranges from 5 percent in the CIA study area percent to 12.5 percent in the City of South Lake Tahoe. It is anticipated that demand for employees would be partially met by unemployed residents of the South Shore and would not require all new workers to come from outside of this area. As shown in Table 3.4-2, housing vacancy rates range from approximately 7.5 percent in the Stateline CDP to approximately 50 percent in the CIA study area. As described above in “Housing Occupancy,” some of these housing units are likely vacation rentals or seasonal rentals and, according to the City of South Lake Tahoe Housing Element Background Report, approximately 15 percent of vacant homes in the city were available for rent and approximately 3 percent were available for sale. Therefore, because the addition of new jobs in the project site could be partially met by existing unemployed residents of the South Shore, this alternative is not anticipated to result in a substantial increase in population that would lead to an increased demand for housing that could not be met by the supply of existing vacant homes available for rent.  The location of new jobs and additional residences resulting from Alternative B with mixed-use development would be primarily within the TCAP boundaries. As described for Impact 3.4-2, construction of new housing units and CFA is limited to the number of allocations available, which are capped by the Regional Plan. Additionally, this area is planned (in the Regional Plan and TCAP) for an increase in density and development with a mix of uses and is intended to concentrate development in town centers that are walkable, close to jobs, shopping, and entertainment. Implementation of Alternative B with mixed-use development would help to achieve the intent of the TCAP to provide for orderly, well-planned, and balanced growth and to develop a mix of uses that promote convenience, economic vitality, and a pleasant quality of life with a greater range of facilities and services for visitors and residents (City of South Lake Tahoe 2013:2-6). Furthermore, these types of changes to the density of development within the TCAP boundary were assessed in the TCAP and Regional Plan environmental documents (City of South Lake Tahoe 2013, TRPA 2012a). As shown in Table 3.4-10 and Exhibit 2-9, the estimated density of housing units in the mixed-use development would meet the density standards set forth in the TCAP and PAS 092. The TCAP environmental document determined that future development within the TCAP boundaries and the Region would meet future housing demand, including demand for affordable housing (City of South Lake Tahoe 2013:129-130). The Regional Plan EIS determined that buildout of the Regional Plan would result in a balance between jobs and housing and lead to more concentrated development in community centers, with greater improvements to walkability, feasibility of other alternative transportation, and the resultant benefits (TRPA 2012a:3.12-11 – 3.12-12). Implementation of Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not change the planned location and distribution of population, employment, and housing planned for the Region. For these reasons, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize the effects related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region during operation such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for effects related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region during operation as described for the replacement housing on the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of these effects would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region during operation. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would minimize the effects related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region during operation such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Table 3.4-10 Multi-Family Density in the Mixed-Use Development Sites for Alternatives B and C  Mixed-Use Development  Estimated Density1  Allowable Density (units/acre; zoning designation)  Site 1  24.83  25 (TSC-MU)  Site 2  21.88 2  25 (TSC-NMX) 15 (PAS 092) Use not permitted (OS)  Site 3  31.07 3  25 (TSC-C)  Abbreviations: TSC-C = Tourist Center Core, TSC-MU = Tourist Center Mixed-Use, TSC-NMX = Tourist Center Neighborhood, OS = Open Space 1 Estimated densities are based on the sites’ sizes and proposed number of units identified in Exhibit 2-9 and represent the maximum amount of development that could occur on each site.  2 Development on Site 2 would be arranged such that the building(s) in PAS 092 would meet the density limit set forth in that PAS and the building(s) in the area zoned TSC-NMX would meet the density set forth in the TCAP. No buildings would be proposed in the portion of the site zoned OS. 3 The estimated density for Site 3 exceeds allowable density because it assumes the development would construct affordable housing and could utilize density bonus units. Source: compiled by Ascent Environmental, Inc. in 2016  Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Alternative C transportation improvements would include the same project components as Alternative B, including relocation of displaced residents to deed-restricted housing; however, Alternative C would split eastbound and westbound directions on US 50 from the US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection in California to the US 50/Lake Parkway intersection in Nevada. Compared to Alternative B, this would result in Caltrans and NDOT assuming responsibility for roadway maintenance through the tourist core and on the realigned US 50, and would reduce the City of South Lake Tahoe and Douglas County maintenance responsibilities in this area. Road maintenance would be similar to that for Alternative B and would not result in a substantial increase in demand for maintenance employees. For the same reasons described above, Alternative C would not generate a substantial amount of new employment during operation and, thus, would not generate permanent population growth or increase the demand for housing. Additionally, Alternative C transportation improvements would not indirectly induce population growth that would generate additional demand for housing. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the effects related to the location, distribution, or growth of the human population for the Region during operation such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Implementation of Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would generate the same demand for maintenance employees as described for Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing. Alternative C would generate demand for up to 269 employees associated with commercial uses that would be part of the mixed-use development and would offset the loss of 92 jobs displaced by the realigned US 50 and mixed-use development (see Table 3.4-14). Alternative C would also add up to 227 new housing units and displace up to 83 housing units, resulting in a net increase of 144 housing units and an increase in population of 328 people (see Table 3.4-7), slightly more than the population increase that would be expected under Alternative B with mixed-use development. The density of housing units proposed for the Alternative C mixed-use development would be the same as described above for Alternative B, which is consistent with allowable density limits set forth in the TCAP and PAS 092. For the same reasons described above, the employment and population increases that would occur with implementation of Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not result in a substantial increase in unmet demand for housing or change the location and distribution of population, employment, and housing planned for the Region. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would avoid or minimize the effects related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region during operation such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for effects related to alteration of the location, distribution, or growth of the human population planned for the Region during operation as described for the replacement housing on the mixed-use development sites.

Operational road maintenance would be anticipated to be the same as for Alternative B.  For the reasons described above, Alternative D transportation improvements would not generate a substantial amount of new employment during operation and, thus, would not generate permanent population growth that would increase the demand for housing. Additionally, Alternative D would not indirectly induce population growth that would generate additional demand for housing. This impact would be less-than-significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the effects related to the location, distribution, or growth of the human population for the Region during operation such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Implementation of Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would generate the same demand for maintenance employees as Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing. Implementation of Alternative D would generate demand for up to 210 employees associated with new commercial uses, which would offset the loss of 78 jobs displaced by the realigned US 50 and mixed-use development (see Table 3.4-14). Implementation of Alternative D with mixed-use development would include up to 224 new housing units but would displace up to 78 housing units, resulting in a net increase of 146 housing units and 333 people, slightly higher than the population increase under Alternative B (see Table 3.4-7). As shown in Table 3.4-11 and Exhibit 2-11, the estimated density of housing units in the mixed-use development would meet the density standards set forth in the TCAP and PAS 092. For the same reasons described above, the employment and population increases that would occur with implementation of Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not result in a substantial increase in unmet demand for housing or change the location and distribution of population, employment, and housing planned for the Region. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Table 3.4-11 Multi-Family Density on the Mixed-Use Development Sites for Alternative D  Mixed-Use Development  Estimated Density1  Allowable Density (units/acre; zoning designation)  Site 1  23.03  25 (TSC-MU, TSC-NMX)  Site 2  24.14 2  25 (TSC-NMX) 15 (PAS 092) Use not permitted (OS)   Site 3  31.2 3  25 (TSC-C)  Abbreviations: TSC-C = Tourist Center Core, TSC-MU = Tourist Center Mixed-Use, TSC-NMX = Tourist Center Neighborhood, OS = Open Space 1 Estimated densities are based on the sites’ sizes and proposed number of units identified in Exhibit 2-11 and represent the maximum amount of development that could occur on each site.  2 Development on Sites 1B and 2 would be arranged such that the building(s) in PAS 092 would meet the density limit set forth in that PAS and the building(s) in the area zoned TSC-NMX would meet the density set forth in the TCAP.

The skywalk would serve as a pedestrian crossing after the removal of the existing signal and crossing between the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino and Montbleu Resort. Alternative E would require additional maintenance that would be conducted by NDOT staff because the skywalk would be located within the NDOT ROW. Implementation of Alternative E would require an increase in permanent maintenance; however, it would not increase maintenance needs substantially over existing conditions, and any need for additional employees could be met by the existing population. Therefore, this alternative would not generate population growth or additional demand for housing. Additionally, Alternative E would not indirectly induce population growth that would generate additional demand for housing. Consequently, this alternative would not induce any permanent population growth and housing demand. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative E would avoid or minimize the effects related to the location, distribution, or growth of the human population for the Region during operation such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures Mitigation Measure 3.4-1: Minimize effects on the character and cohesiveness of the Rocky Point neighborhood The following mitigation measure applies to Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. With respect to changes in visual conditions and noise that affect the character and cohesiveness of the Rocky Point neighborhood, implement Mitigation Measure 3.7-1a (see Section 3.7, “Visual Resources/Aesthetics”) and Mitigation Measures 3.15-3a, 3.15-3b, and 3.15-3c (see Section 3.15, “Noise and Vibration”).  Significance after Mitigation With implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.7-1a (see Section 3.7, “Visual Resources/Aesthetics”), the realigned US 50 would be designed in accordance with all applicable design standards and guidelines and thus would exhibit a high level of visual quality, itself; however, it would substantially alter neighborhood character. The addition of noise barriers could also contribute to the change in visual character. Because of the nature of the change – that is, rerouting a highway through a residential neighborhood – it would not be feasible to reduce the magnitude of the visual impact.  Implementation of Mitigation Measures 3.15-3a, 3.15-3b, and 3.15-3c, which are applicable to Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements, respectively (see Section 3.15, “Noise and Vibration”), require implementation of specific performance requirements and could include additional noise-reduction features, such as use of rubberized hot-mix asphalt or outdoor sound barriers. The selection and design of specific traffic noise reduction measures shall be supported by a site-specific mitigation assessment conducted by a qualified acoustical engineer or consultant selected by the project proponent and shall be fully funded by the project proponent. These measures would effectively reduce traffic noise, but it would not be feasible to reduce traffic noise to below traffic noise levels considered significant by Caltrans and TRPA.  Regarding the interruption of pedestrian access along the realigned highway, as part of the signage plan for the project, the project will install wayfinding signage for pedestrian paths and sidewalks to guide people to the new intersections where safe crossings of the new US 50 alignment are provided. The project would design mixed-use developments with a priority for pedestrian connectivity to both surrounding residential and commercial areas.  An additional mitigation measure was considered to address the physical division of the neighborhood. This measure would have constructed a raised pedestrian walkway to provide access across the realigned US 50, connecting residents west of the new highway to adjacent commercial properties to the east. However, this mitigation measure was dismissed because the raised pedestrian walkway or tunnel would require long approach ramps to meet Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements. The long approach ramps would likely require acquisition of additional properties and would not reduce the trip lengths for pedestrians. Notwithstanding these measures, the physical barrier to pedestrian access would remain. The physical division of the Rocky Point neighborhood associated with the new US 50 alignment and associated changes in visual character and noise resulting from Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would remain after incorporation of feasible mitigation measures. Therefore, the community character impact of Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would remain significant and unavoidable for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, environmental consequences of implementing Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements with implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.4-1 would be adverse. 3.4.2 Real Property Acquisitions, Dislocations, and Relocations REGULATORY SETTING Federal Refer to the discussion of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act (Uniform Act) in Section 3.4.1, “Community Character and Cohesion.” All relocation services and benefits are administered without regard to race, color, national origin, or sex in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act (42 USC 2000d et seq.). Refer to Appendix H for a copy of the Caltrans Title VI Policy Statement.  Tahoe Regional Planning Agency Lake Tahoe Regional Plan TRPA regulates growth and development in the Lake Tahoe Region through the Regional Plan, which includes the Goals and Policies, Code of Ordinances, and other components.  Goals and Policies The Land Use Subelement and Housing Subelement of the Regional Plan Land Use Element include policies that assess housing needs of the Region and make provisions for adequate housing. The Housing Subelement includes policies that encourage local governments to assume their “fair share” of the responsibility to provide lower and very-low income housing (Policy HS-1.2) and support the development of lower and very-low income housing through development incentives and that are designed and occupied in accordance with local, regional, state, and federal standards (Policy HS-1.1) (TRPA 2012b:2-20 – 2-21). The full text of these goals and policies, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with the goals and policies, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.” Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities TRPA has not established any environmental threshold carrying capacities (thresholds) that pertain to relocations and real property acquisition. Code of Ordinances Definitions of Affordable Housing and Moderate Income Housing Chapter 90 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances defines affordable housing as: Residential housing, deed restricted to be used exclusively for lower-income households (income not in excess of 80 percent of the respective county’s median income) and for very low-income households (not to exceed 50 percent of the respective county’s median income). Such housing units shall be made available for rental or sale at a cost that does not exceed the recommended state and federal standards. Each county’s median income shall be determined according to the income limits published annually by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. For multi-person dwellings, the affordable housing determination shall be made using each resident’s income and not the collective income of the dwelling. Chapter 90 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances defines moderate incoming housing as: Residential housing, deed restricted to be used exclusively as a residential dwelling by permanent residents with an income not in excess of 120 percent of the respective county’s median income. Such housing units shall be made available for rental or sale at a cost that does not exceed the recommended state and federal standards. Each county’s median income will be determined according to the income limits published annually by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  The term “affordability,” as used in both TRPA definitions, includes all associated housing costs, including rent and ownership costs, ownership financing, essential utilities, insurance, and taxes. Both of these definitions are based on the “respective county’s median income.” In 2011, the applicable median income for El Dorado County was $75,100 for a four-person household, $67,600 for a three-person household, $60,100 for a two-person household, and $52,550 for a one-person household (TTD 2012:43). Allocation of Development and Bonus Unit Ordinances Plan areas with the Preferred Affordable Housing Area designation have been designated by TRPA as preferred locations for affordable housing and are eligible for special incentives found in the TRPA Code, including allocation exemptions (Chapter 50) and bonus-unit assignment (Chapter 52). Plan areas with the Multi-Residential Incentive Program designation are eligible for the multi-residential incentive program under Chapter 52 of the TRPA Code, which allows “bonus units” to be substituted for needed development rights for multi-family housing. Housing units that are deed-restricted as affordable in perpetuity may obtain multi-residential “bonus units” to substitute for their needed development rights and are exempt from the need for an allocation when located within an area that is both designated as a Preferred Affordable Housing Area and eligible for the Multi-Residential Incentive Program. The TCAP and Plan Area Statement (PAS) 092 Pioneer/Ski Run are identified as Preferred Affordable Housing Areas. Additionally, the City of South Lake Tahoe has a Certified Moderate Income Housing Program under Sections 50.5.2.B and 52.3.6 of the TRPA Code; thus, moderate income housing units are eligible to earn allocations from TRPA’s unused allocation pool subject to TRPA’s allocation procedures. A total of 90 residential bonus units are assigned to the TCAP that may be used for affordable housing units or as a match for transferring development rights to centers (City of South Lake Tahoe 2013:10-9). State Refer to the discussion of the Caltrans Relocation Assistance Program included in Section 3.4.1, “Community Character and Cohesion.” Local El Dorado County Housing Choice Voucher Program The Housing Choice Voucher Program (formerly Section 8) provides assistance to help low-income residents of El Dorado County afford safe, decent, and sanitary housing. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides funds to the El Dorado County Public Housing Authority to administer the program. Currently, the El Dorado County Public Housing Authority has 77 families under lease in South Lake Tahoe. There are 279 families on the wait list, 27 of which are from South Lake Tahoe. Of the families on the wait list, 77 earn approximately 50 percent of the area median income, and 212 families earn approximately 30 percent of the area median income. The wait list is currently closed (City of South Lake Tahoe 2014:4-88). City of South Lake Tahoe City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan The City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan Housing Element includes goals and policies that focus on the housing needs of the local workforce (Policies HE 2-3, 2-5, and 2-9), address long-term affordable ownership opportunities for lower- and moderate-income households (Policy HE 2-2 and 2-6), allow a variety of housing choices (Policies 2-3 and 5-1), and promote the preservation and rehabilitation of existing housing (Policies 2-6 and 3-4) (City of South Lake Tahoe 2014:HE-2, HE-3, HE-7, HE-8, HE-13, HE-14). The full text of these goals and policies, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with the goals and policies, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.”  Single Room Occupancy Ordinance The City of South Lake Tahoe’s recently-adopted Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Ordinance addresses the shortage of decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable rental housing options for low-income persons in the city. Hotels have historically provided affordable rental options of last resort for low-income persons. The SRO Ordinance implemented common-sense regulations for the use of hotel/motel rooms as quality transitional housing. This ordinance provides an incentive to hotels/motels in the city to rehabilitate units that do not meet minimum building, housing, and property maintenance standards so as to provide safe, habitable rental units for low-income persons. In doing so, they are exempt from transient occupancy tax (TOT) obligations for those units. This ordinance establishes development, design, and maintenance standards to preserve and enhance the quality of life for residents of the city living in such units.  Lodging properties with existing SRO units on the effective date of the ordinance (June 16, 2015) had 30 days to submit a completed SRO permit application. Lodging properties without existing SRO units at that time may apply for an SRO permit at any time, but no less than 30 days before letting SRO units. SRO permits shall provide a 12-month period within which permittees may complete all development, design, and maintenance standards required by the ordinance.  Current estimates are that 58 hotels/motels rent some or all of their rooms for long-term occupancy (30 days or longer). The SRO program legitimizes the use of these hotels/motels as temporary transitional housing, increases the standard of living for the occupants, and improves overall community appearance. Currently, 41 hotels/motels in the city have received an SRO Permit (Roverud, pers. comm., 2016b). With over 100 hotels/motels in city (Tahoe South 2016), approximately 30 percent of the hotels/motels currently participate in the program. There are 7,026 tourist accommodation units (TAUs) in the city and any of them can be permitted as an SRO (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2015:39). Illegal Unit Conversion Program Since the adoption of TRPA regulations in 1987, some property owners have constructed illegal second units in South Lake Tahoe (City of South Lake Tahoe 2014:4-87 – 4-88). In April 1993, the city adopted an ordinance authorizing certain illegally constructed second units to become legalized if they meet specific criteria. The program was created specifically to help meet the city’s affordable housing needs. To be legalized, a second unit:  cannot have been illegally constructed since the ordinance was adopted in April 1993;  may contain one unit beyond permissible density (detached, attached, or within the legal dwelling);  must conform to height, setbacks, and design standards;  must meet health and safety standards;  must be located on a parcel that contains 1.5 parking spaces per unit;  must pay South Tahoe Public Utility District all costs for illegal sewer connections; and   must be deed restricted as lower-income housing. Through the Illegal Unit Conversion Program, the city has authorized 25 illegally constructed units to be brought into compliance with health and safety standards and other applicable codes. The cost of bringing the illegal unit up to code is paid by the property owner. Douglas County The Douglas County Development Code contains provisions to encourage affordable housing. Chapter 20.440, Density Bonus and Affordable Housing Agreements, was adopted in 1996. The chapter provides for an increase of density up to 25 percent in return for provision of housing at affordable levels. AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT The information in this section is based on the Relocation Study for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project (TTD 2012) and the Community Impact Assessment (CIA; FHWA et al. 2014). The Relocation Study is included in this EIR/EIS/EIS in Appendix F. Affordable and Moderate Income Housing As described in “Regulatory Setting - Local,” El Dorado County provides housing assistance through the Housing Choice Voucher Program (formerly Section 8). The South Shore area, encompassing the City of South Lake Tahoe and the portion of Douglas County within the Basin, also includes affordable housing units for very-low and low-income households that have been established through either government assistance, TRPA mitigation, or affordable housing agreements (Table 3.4-12). South Lake Tahoe contains 421 affordable housing units, and the Tahoe Basin portion of Douglas County contains 133. Some of these affordable housing complexes, such as Kelly Ridge and Tahoe Senior Plaza, are dedicated for seniors; Sky Forest Acres is dedicated for persons with disabilities.  Table 3.4-12 Affordable Housing near the Project Site  Location  Number of Affordable Units1  City of South Lake Tahoe  The Aspens2  48  Bijou Woods Apartments  92  Evergreen Tahoe Apartments  26   Kelly Ridge3   33  Sierra Garden Apartments  76  Sky Forest Acres4  17  Tahoe Pines Apartments  27  Tahoe Senior Plaza3  32  Tahoe Valley Townhomes  70  City of South Lake Tahoe Subtotal  421  Douglas County  Aspen Grove  39  Lake Vista I  24  Lake Vista II  40  Meadow Brook  30  Douglas County Tahoe Basin Subtotal  133  Total Number of Affordable Housing Units in the South Shore  554  1 Includes very-low and low-income housing units. 2 Includes one moderate income unit. 3 Age restricted for persons 62 years old or older. 4 For persons with disabilities. Source: City of South Lake Tahoe 2014:4-95, Douglas County 2012:5  ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES Methods and Assumptions The Relocation Study prepared for the project identified residents and businesses that might require relocation as a result of the project (TTD 2012). Following completion of the Relocation Study, additional design refinements for the alternative alignments and replacement housing options have resulted in modifications to the list of properties potentially affected by the project. In some cases, some properties have been removed from the list of partial or full acquisition and other properties have been added to the list of acquisitions (see Tables 2-1 and 2-2 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives,” Exhibits 3.4-2 through 3.4-4, and Appendix B). To assess potential impacts, the parcels that would require partial or full acquisition under Alternatives B, C, and D were reviewed for the following circumstances:  whether the acquisition would be permanent or temporary,  what type of acquisition would be required (full acquisition or easement), and  whether the acquisition would include relocation. The list of parcels identified for acquisition is preliminary but represents the maximum number of acquisitions required for implementation of the build alternatives. The complete list of parcels proposed for acquisition for each alternative is included in Appendix B, “Maps Showing Parcel Acquisition Needs and Geometric Approval Drawings for Alternatives B, C, and D,” and represents the maximum number and extent of acquisitions that would occur. Refinements to the final project design could result in a smaller project footprint, which could result in fewer partial and/or full acquisitions. The number of parcels and type of units that would be acquired for the realigned US 50 ROW for each alternative are summarized in Tables 2-1 and 2-2. The number of parcels and type of units that would be acquired for the mixed-use development are summarized in Table 2-3 and Table 2-4. A combination of methods was used to determine employee numbers for existing businesses that could be displaced by the project. Several businesses provided typical employee numbers via telephone communication. Conservative estimates of existing employee numbers are based on existing numbers of employees at similar businesses for those businesses that did not provide employee numbers. Significance Criteria NEPA Criteria An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the locally preferred action. Under NEPA, the significance of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are encompassed by the CEQA and TRPA criteria used for this analysis. TRPA Criteria The “Population” and “Housing” criteria from the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist were used to evaluate the population and housing impacts of the build alternatives. The project would result in a significant impact if it would:  include or result in the temporary or permanent displacement of residents;  affect existing housing, or create a demand for additional housing; or  result in the loss of housing for lower-income and very-low-income households. Lower-income and very-low-income households are those that meet the TRPA definition of affordable housing in Chapter 90 of the TRPA Code and included above. The term “affordable housing” is used throughout this document in accordance with the definition included in Chapter 90 of the TRPA Code and is inclusive of lower-income and very-low-income households.  CEQA Criteria Based on Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines, impacts on population, employment, and housing would be significant if the project would:  displace substantial numbers of existing housing, necessitating the construction of replacement housing elsewhere; or  displace substantial numbers of people, necessitating the construction of replacement housing elsewhere. Environmental Effects of the Project Alternatives Impact 3.4-4: Housing supply availability, including affordable housing Acquisition of land and buildings necessary for the US 50 realignment, new US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection, new sidewalks and bike lanes, and the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would displace existing residences with the Alternative B, C, and D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing. TTD would provide relocation assistance to all eligible displaced owner and tenant residents in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Act and the Relocation Assistance Law. These alternatives would also include construction of replacement housing, including deed-restricted affordable and deed-restricted moderate-income housing, equal to or greater than the number of housing units displaced prior to relocating owner and tenant residents and prior to construction of transportation improvements in California. For these reasons, the Alternative B, C, and D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in no net loss of housing, including affordable and moderate-income housing, in the South Shore and there would be no need to construct additional affordable housing elsewhere beyond those included in the project.  Alternative A would include no changes and Alternative E would not require acquisition of private property and, thus, would not displace housing (including affordable housing) or residents. NEPA Environmental Consequences:  Compliance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law and the design features of Alternatives B, C, and D would avoid or minimize effects on housing supply availability, including affordable housing, such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; No Impact for Alternatives A and E CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, and D; No Impact for Alternatives A and E Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Because Alternative A would maintain the existing US 50 alignment and would not make any other improvements that would affect residents adjacent to the roadway, this alternative would not displace residents or housing. There would be no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Implementation of Alternative B transportation improvements would reroute the existing US 50 through a neighborhood, necessitating acquisition of parcels for the new highway ROW and other transportation improvements, including the new US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection, and new sidewalks and bike lanes along realigned US 50. Alternative B would result in 42 full parcel acquisitions (all in California) and 53 partial parcel acquisitions (42 in California, 11 in Nevada; see Table 2-1, Exhibit 3.4-2, and Appendix B). The Alternative B transportation improvements would displace owner and tenant residents and demolish 76 housing units, including 58 affordable housing units and seven moderate-income housing units (Table 3.4-13). The loss of these residential structures would not reduce the housing supply in the South Shore, including the number of affordable housing units, because the project would construct an equal or greater number of replacement housing units that could be used by displaced owners and tenants before groundbreaking were to occur in California (see Section 2.3.1, “Replacement Housing,” in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). The effects of the replacement housing are discussed further below under “Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing.” More specifically, with Alternative B, the project would construct a minimum of 76 new housing units, which would be available as rental units to displaced owners and tenants and would include 58 deed-restricted affordable housing units, seven deed-restricted moderate-income housing units, and 11 market-rate housing units. These new housing units are considered last resort housing for the purposes of the Uniform Act and their construction prior to constructing the transportation improvements in California are necessary because of the limited supply of replacement housing in the study area and elsewhere in the South Shore. (Note: The term “last resort housing” is a term defined in 49 CFR 24, Section 24.404 and is used to describe housing that would need to be constructed for the project to move forward and to provide replacement housing for residents displaced by the project because there is a limited supply of adequate housing in the South Shore area.) As described in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Alternatives,” all of the replacement housing units would be deed-restricted such that the housing units must be used for full-time residents and may not be used as second homes or for vacation rental use. While the exact number of owners and tenants in these housing units would be determined at the final design stage for the project and during the relocation assistance process, surveys conducted for the Relocation Study indicate that most of the residents are tenants and very few residents are owners (TTD 2012:15). At the time of preparing the Relocation Study, survey results show that there were seven households with elderly members (persons 62 years or older) but there were no households that reported residents with physical disabilities (TTD 2012:16). In accordance with the Uniform Act and as part of the relocation process, TTD would take care to meet the special needs of each household that contains elderly members or persons with physical disabilities. The Alternative B transportation improvements would also displace up to 44 SRO units (see Table 3.4-13). These SRO units are used as temporary transitional housing; they are not intended to provide year-round residency. Units with SRO permits can be used as standard hotel/motel rooms where TOT taxes are collected at any time, which is demonstrated by those hotel/motel rooms affected by the project. Between summer 2015 and summer 2016, the number of SROs at the Elizabeth Lodge fluctuated between 15 to 18 units on a monthly basis (Roverud, pers. comm., 2016a). During this period, the number of SRO units at the South Shore Inn fluctuated between two and 21 units; the number of SRO units at the Traveler’s Inn and Suites fluctuated between two and four units; and the number of SRO units at National 9 Inn fluctuated between zero and two units. Additionally, any hotel/motel property owner in the city has the choice to obtain a SRO permit for existing TAUs. Within a half mile of the hotel/motels displaced by the project, 30 hotel/motels containing 1,262 TAUs (excluding timeshare lodging) are eligible for SRO-unit status. Of these units, more than 520 hotel units are in hotel/motels comparable to those that would be displaced by the project (compiled by Ascent Environmental, Inc. 2016). There are four hotel/motels in this area that already provide 66 SRO units (Roverud, pers. comm., 2016b). Further, SRO units are recognized currently and historically by TRPA as TAUs and not as residential units. For these reasons, the SRO units displaced by the Alternative B transportation improvements are not counted toward the housing unit and affordable housing unit totals. The Relocation Study concludes that there would be existing available housing units in the South Shore area that could be used as replacement housing. This remains true; however, the option to purchase and deed restrict or seek other replacement housing options in the South Shore area instead of constructing new housing units would conflict with the project objective related to a no net loss in housing supply. Additionally, as described under “Housing Occupancy” in Section 3.4.1, there is evidence to suggest that about 15 percent of the supply of vacant homes are available for rent by full-time residents (see “Housing Occupancy” in Section 3.4.1). The limited supply of housing for permanent residents, and for residents seeking affordable and moderate-income housing in particular, in the study area and South Shore overall provides support for the need to construct replacement housing as part of the project, prior to displacing residents and construction of transportation improvements in California.  As described above, implementation of Alternative B transportation improvements combined with constructing the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in the displacement of 58 affordable, seven moderate-income, and 11 other housing units. The existing affordable housing units are not deed-restricted for affordable housing purposes; however, the determination that these units are affordable and have historically been used as affordable housing is based on an evaluation of rent or for-sale value below the levels established by the 80 percent median income threshold, as identified in the TTD affordable housing study (Massey 2016). Alternative B would construct a minimum of 58 new deed-restricted affordable housing units, seven deed-restricted moderate-income, and 11 market-rate housing units as replacement housing for displaced residents. The amount of deed-restricted affordable housing for lower-income and very low-income (as defined in Chapter 90 of TRPA Code) and low income (as defined in the Uniform Act, 49 CFR Section 24.402(b)) to be constructed by the project would be determined at the final design stage and as part of the relocation process.  Table 3.4-13 Displaced Housing Units  Alternatives  Affordable Housing Units  Moderate-Income Housing Units  Other Housing Units1  Total Housing Units  Motels  Total Motel Units  Motel Units with SRO Permit2  Transportation Improvements (Acquisition for ROW)  A: No Build  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  B: Triangle  58  7  11  76  4  114  44  C: Triangle One-Way  53  7  11  71  4  114  44  D: PSR Alternative 2  68  0  0  68  2  41  4  E: Skywalk  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing (Acquisition for Mixed-Use Development Only)  A: No Build  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  B: Triangle  12  0  0  12  2  41  4  C: Triangle One-Way  12  0  0  12  2  41  4  D: PSR Alternative 2  6  4  0  10  0  0  0  E: Skywalk  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  1 “Other Housing Units” includes units that are not designated as affordable or moderate-income housing, including uninhabitable units, units boarded up and owned by multiple parties for seasonal use, and seasonal units owned by trusts. 2 “Motel Units with SRO Permit” are Elizabeth Lodge, South Shore Inn, National 9 Inn, and Traveler’s Inn. The SRO numbers fluctuate on a monthly basis and these permit numbers reflect the maximum number of SRO units that could occur at one time. Source: Massey 2016; Roverud, pers. comm., 2016b  TTD would provide relocation assistance to all eligible displaced owner and tenant residents in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Act and the Relocation Assistance Law (see Section 3.4.1, “Community Character and Cohesion,” and Appendix F). These regulatory requirements state that TTD is responsible for assisting displaced residents in relocating to comparable replacement housing, which is determined to be housing in an area that is not generally less desirable than the current dwelling unit with regard to utilities, commercial facilities, schools, and public services; is reasonably accessible to the displaced person’s current place of employment; is comparable in size and structure to the displaced person’s existing home; and which accommodates the size of the household being displaced. Additionally, replacement housing must meet the standard of being decent, safe, and sanitary. Displaced residents may choose to either relocate to the newly constructed housing or may choose to relocate to other housing. The supply of affordable housing units in the South Shore area is limited, but implementation of the project provides new housing units, including affordable housing units, that would be available to displaced owner and tenant residents. Because Alternative B would construct 58 deed-restricted affordable housing units, seven deed-restricted moderate-income housing units, and 11 market rate housing units, the project would result in no net reduction in housing supply in the South Shore. For these reasons, for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, the Alternative B transportation improvements would result in a less-than-significant impact on housing, including affordable housing, in the South Shore and there would be no need to construct additional affordable housing elsewhere beyond those included in the project.  For the purposes of NEPA, compliance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law and the design features of the Alternative B transportation improvements including construction of replacement housing would avoid or minimize effects on housing supply availability, including affordable housing, such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Implementation of Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would reroute the existing US 50 through a neighborhood and would extend the realigned US 50 behind the casinos. This alternative would also involve construction of new replacement housing and mixed-use development to include commercial uses at three possible locations adjacent to the realigned US 50 (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-10). These three mixed-use development sites are the preferred location for construction of replacement housing, which would include replacement housing for 12 housing units (all affordable housing) that would be displaced by mixed-use development at Site 2.  In addition to the full acquisition of 42 parcels (all in California) for the realigned US 50 ROW, Alternative B with mixed-use development would result in nine full parcel acquisitions (all in California) for the mixed-use development (see Table 2-1, Exhibit 3.4-2, and Appendix B). This would result in a total of 51 full parcel acquisitions for construction of the new ROW and mixed-use development, including replacement housing. Of the 57 parcels identified for partial acquisition for the realigned US 50 ROW, eight parcels would be subject to full acquisition for the mixed-use development, reducing the total number of partial parcel acquisitions to 49 parcels. In addition to the housing units displaced for ROW purposes, mixed-use development under this alternative would displace 12 housing units located at mixed-use development Site 2, all of which are affordable housing units, and one additional hotel (Traveler’s Inn) with four units operating pursuant to the city’s SRO ordinance (Table 3.4-13). As described above, the SRO units displaced by this alternative would not count toward the loss of housing units or affordable housing units. Construction of the realigned US 50 and mixed-use development would collectively result in the displacement of 88 housing units, including 70 affordable housing units.  TTD would provide relocation assistance to all eligible displaced owner and tenant residents in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Act and the Relocation Assistance Law (see Section 3.4.1, “Community Character and Cohesion,” and Appendix F). As described for Alternative B transportation improvements, the supply of affordable housing units in the South Shore area is limited, but implementation of the project would provide new housing units, including affordable housing units, that would be available to displaced owner and tenant residents as replacement housing. Because the project would construct 70 deed-restricted affordable housing units, seven deed-restricted moderate-income housing units, and 11 market rate housing units, the project would result in no net reduction in supply of housing in the South Shore. As described in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Alternatives,” all of the replacement housing units would be deed-restricted such that the housing units must be used for full-time residents and may not be used as second homes or for vacation rental use. For these reasons, for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, the Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on housing, including affordable housing, in the South Shore and there would be no need to construct additional affordable housing elsewhere beyond those included in the project. For the purposes of NEPA, compliance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law and the design features of Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would avoid or minimize effects on housing supply availability, including affordable housing, such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential loss of housing supply, including affordable housing, as described for the replacement housing on the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential impacts on housing supply availability, including affordable housing, would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would have a less-than-significant impact on housing supply availability, including affordable housing. For the purposes of NEPA, compliance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law and the design features of Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would avoid or minimize effects on housing supply availability, including affordable housing, such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Implementation of the Alternative C transportation improvements would reroute the existing US 50 through an existing neighborhood, necessitating acquisition of numerous parcels for the ROW for the new highway, similar to that which would occur with the Alternative B transportation improvements. The Alternative C transportation improvements would result in 40 full parcel acquisitions (all in California) and 51 partial parcel acquisitions (40 parcels in California and 11 parcels in Nevada; see Table 2-1, Exhibit 3.4-3, and Appendix B). This alternative would displace 71 housing units, including 53 affordable housing units, which is less than under Alternative B transportation improvements (see Table 3.4-13). Similar to that described above for Alternative B, Alternative C would construct 71 new housing units, which would be available to displaced owners and tenants and would include 53 deed-restricted affordable housing units, seven deed-restricted moderate-income housing units, and 11 market-rate housing units, prior to constructing the transportation improvements in California. As described in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Alternatives,” all of the replacement housing units would be deed-restricted such that the housing units must be used for full-time residents and may not be used as second homes or for vacation rental use. The realigned US 50 ROW would also displace 44 motel units with SRO permits, the same as under Alternative B. As described above, the SRO units displaced by this alternative would not count toward the housing unit and affordable housing unit totals.  TTD would provide relocation assistance to all eligible displaced owner and tenant residents in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Act and the Relocation Assistance Law (see Section 3.4.1, “Community Character and Cohesion,” and Appendix F). As described for Alternative B, the supply of affordable housing units in the South Shore area is limited, but implementation of the project provides new housing units, including affordable and moderate-income housing units, that would be available to displaced owner and tenant residents. Because Alternative C would construct 53 deed-restricted affordable housing units, seven deed-restricted moderate-income, and 11 market rate housing units, this alternative would result in no net reduction in housing supply in the South Shore. For these reasons, for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, the Alternative C transportation improvements would result in a less-than-significant impact on housing, including affordable housing, in the South Shore and there would be no need to construct additional affordable housing elsewhere beyond those included in the project. For the purposes of NEPA, compliance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law and the design features of the Alternative C transportation improvements including construction of replacement housing would avoid or minimize effects on housing supply availability, including affordable housing, such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Implementation of Alternative C would reroute the existing US 50 through an existing neighborhood and would extend the realigned US 50 ROW behind the casinos. This alternative would also involve construction of replacement housing and mixed-use development to include commercial uses at three possible locations adjacent to the realigned US 50 (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-10). These three mixed-use development sites are the preferred location for construction of replacement housing, which would include replacement housing for 12 housing units (all affordable housing) that would be displaced by mixed-use development Site 2. In addition to the full acquisition of 40 parcels (all in California) for the realigned US 50 ROW, implementation of Alternative C mixed-use development would result in nine full parcel acquisitions for construction of the new mixed-use development (all in California; see Table 2-1, Exhibit 3.4-3, and Appendix B). This alternative would require acquisition of 49 parcels for construction of the realigned US 50 and the mixed-use development, including replacement housing. Of the 57 parcels identified for partial acquisition for the realigned US 50 ROW, eight parcels would be subject to full acquisition for the mixed-use development, reducing the total number of partial parcel acquisitions to 49 parcels. In addition to the housing units displaced for ROW acquisition, mixed-use development under this alternative would displace 12 housing units located at mixed-use development Site 2, all of which are affordable housing, and one additional hotel (Traveler’s Inn) with four units operating pursuant to the city’s SRO ordinance (Table 3.4-13). As described above, the SRO units displaced by the Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not count toward the loss of housing units or affordable housing units. Construction of the realigned US 50 and mixed-use development would collectively result in the displacement of 83 housing units, including 65 affordable housing units and 7 moderate-income housing units. TTD would provide relocation assistance to all eligible displaced owner and tenant residents in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Act and the Relocation Assistance Law (see Section 3.4.1, “Community Character and Cohesion,” and Appendix F). As described for the Alternative B transportation improvements, the supply of affordable housing units in the South Shore area is limited, but implementation of the project would provide new housing units, including deed-restricted affordable housing units and deed-restricted moderate-income housing units, that would be available to displaced owners and tenant residents as replacement housing. Because the project would construct 65 deed-restricted affordable housing units, 7 deed-restricted moderate-income housing units, and 11 market rate housing units, the project would result in no net reduction in housing units in the South Shore. As described in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Alternatives,” all of the replacement housing units would be deed-restricted such that the housing units must be used for full-time residents and may not be used as second homes or for vacation rental use. For these reasons, for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, the Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on housing, including affordable housing, in the South Shore and there would be no need to construct additional affordable housing elsewhere beyond those included in the project. For the purposes of NEPA, compliance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law and the design features of Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would avoid or minimize effects on housing supply availability, including affordable housing, such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential loss of housing supply, including affordable housing, as described for the replacement housing on the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential impacts on housing supply availability, including affordable housing, would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would have a less-than-significant impact on housing supply availability, including affordable housing. For the purposes of NEPA, compliance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law and the design features of Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would avoid or minimize effects on housing supply availability, including affordable housing, such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements Implementation of the Alternative D transportation improvements would reroute the existing US 50 through an existing neighborhood, necessitating acquisition of parcels for the ROW for the new highway, similar to the Alternative B transportation improvements. The Alternative D transportation improvements would result in 37 full parcel acquisitions (all in California) and 38 partial parcel acquisitions (27 parcels in California and 11 parcels in Nevada; see Table 2-1, Exhibit 3.4-4, and Appendix B). The ROW acquisitions for this alternative would displace 68 housing units, which are all affordable housing units (see Table 3.4-13). Similar to that described above for Alternative B, Alternative D would construct 68 new deed-restricted affordable housing units prior to constructing the transportation improvements in California, which would be available as rental units to displaced owners and tenants. As described in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Alternatives,” all of the replacement housing units would be deed-restricted such that the housing units must be used for full-time residents and may not be used as second homes or for vacation rental use. The realigned US 50 ROW for Alternative D would also displace one hotel/motel (Traveler’s Inn), which includes four motel units with SRO permits. As described above, the SRO units displaced by this alternative would not count toward the loss of housing units or affordable housing units. TTD would provide relocation assistance to all eligible displaced owner and tenant residents in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Act and the Relocation Assistance Law (see Section 3.4.1, “Community Character and Cohesion,” and Appendix F). As described for Alternative B, the supply of affordable housing units in the South Shore area is limited, but implementation of the project provides new housing units, including affordable housing units, that would be available to displaced owner and tenant residents. Because Alternative D would construct 68 deed-restricted affordable housing units, the project would result in no net reduction in housing units in the South Shore. For these reasons, for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, the Alternative D transportation improvements would result in a less-than-significant impact on housing, including affordable housing, in the South Shore and there would be no need to construct additional affordable housing elsewhere beyond those included in the project. For the purposes of NEPA, compliance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law and the design features of Alternative D transportation improvements including construction of replacement housing would avoid or minimize effects on housing supply availability, including affordable housing, such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Implementation of the Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would reroute the existing US 50 through an existing neighborhood and would extend the realigned US 50 ROW behind the casinos. This alternative would also involve construction of mixed-use development containing residential and commercial uses at three locations adjacent to the realigned US 50 (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-10). These three sites are the preferred location for construction of replacement housing. In addition to the full acquisition of 37 parcels (all in California) for the realigned US 50 ROW, implementation of the Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would also result in the full acquisition of 11 parcels (all in California; see Table 2-1, Exhibit 3.4-4, and Appendix B). This alternative would require acquisition of 48 full parcels for construction of the realigned US 50 and mixed-use development. Of the 41 parcels identified for partial acquisition for the realigned US 50 ROW (30 parcels in California, 11 parcels in Nevada), five parcels would be subject to full acquisition for the mixed-use development, reducing the number of partial parcel acquisitions to 36 parcels. In addition to the housing units displaced for ROW acquisition, mixed-use development under this alternative would displace 10 housing units located at mixed-use development Sites 1b and 2, which includes six affordable housing units, four moderate-income housing units, and four motel units with SRO permits (Table 3.4-13). As described above, the SRO units displaced by this alternative would not count toward the loss of housing units or affordable housing units. Construction of the realigned US 50 and mixed-use development would collectively displace 78 housing units, including 74 affordable housing units and four moderate-income housing units. TTD would provide relocation assistance to all eligible displaced owner and tenant residents in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Act and the Relocation Assistance Law (see Section 3.4.1, “Community Character and Cohesion,” and Appendix F). As described for the Alternative B transportation improvements, the supply of affordable housing units in the South Shore area is limited, but implementation of the project provides new housing units, including affordable housing units, that would be available to displaced owner and tenant residents as replacement housing. Because Alternative D would construct 74 deed-restricted affordable housing units and four deed-restricted moderate-income housing units, this alternative would result in no net reduction in housing units in the South Shore. As described in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Alternatives,” all of the replacement housing units would be deed-restricted such that the housing units must be used for full-time residents and may not be used as second homes or for vacation rental use. For these reasons, for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, Alternative D with mixed-use development would result in a less-than-significant impact on housing, including affordable housing, in the South Shore and there would be no need to construct additional affordable housing elsewhere beyond those included in the project. For the purposes of NEPA, compliance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law and the design features of Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would avoid or minimize effects on housing supply availability, including affordable housing, such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential loss of housing supply, including affordable housing, as described for the replacement housing on the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential impacts on housing supply availability, including affordable housing, would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would have a less-than-significant impact on housing supply availability, including affordable housing. For the purposes of NEPA, compliance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law and the design features of Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would avoid or minimize effects on housing supply availability, including affordable housing, such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative E: Skywalk Implementation of Alternative E would result in development of a raised concrete deck over the entire width and length of existing US 50 between Stateline Avenue and the northern end of the Montbleu Resort that would be used by pedestrians along the tourist core. No residences would be affected by this activity. Acquisition of parcels containing residences or businesses would not be required because the features of this alternative would be located within the existing ROW for US 50 through the tourist core. Consequently, Alternative E would not displace residents or housing, including affordable housing, or necessitate the construction of replacement housing elsewhere. For the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA, there would be no impact on housing supply availability. Impact 3.4-5: Displacement of businesses Alternatives B, C, and D, transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would require full acquisition of parcels containing businesses. Alternatives B and C transportation improvements would affect four businesses (14 employees), and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would affect 10 additional businesses (78 additional employees). Alternative D transportation improvements would affect seven businesses (57 employees), and the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would affect three additional businesses (21 additional employees). TTD would provide relocation assistance to all eligible displaced businesses in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Act and the Relocation Assistance Law. The Relocation Study (TTD 2012) indicated that there would be a sufficient supply of existing business relocation properties in the South Shore area. Therefore, implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D, transportation improvements or mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not require construction of new buildings for relocation of displaced businesses. Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, could include construction of new commercial space, which could provide additional locations for the displaced businesses to relocate.  Alternative A would include no changes and Alternative E would not require acquisition of private property and, thus, would not displace businesses. NEPA Environmental Consequences:  Compliance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law and the design features of Alternatives B, C, and D would avoid or minimize effects related to displacement of businesses such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; No Impact for Alternatives A and E CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, and D; No Impact for Alternatives A and E Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Because Alternative A would maintain the existing US 50 alignment and would not make any other improvements that would result in effects on businesses adjacent to the roadway, this alternative would not displace or result in impacts on businesses. There would be no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Implementation of Alternative B transportation improvements would reroute the existing US 50 through an existing neighborhood and would extend the realigned US 50 behind the casinos. Construction of the realigned US 50 and new US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection would necessitate acquisition of parcels and buildings containing businesses. Full acquisition of four privately-owned parcels containing businesses would be required, resulting in the displacement of four hotel/motel businesses under this alternative (see Table 2-2, Table 3.4-14, Exhibit 3.4-2, and Appendix B). Although this alternative would result in partial acquisitions of 19 parcels containing additional businesses (15 parcels in California and 4 parcels in Nevada), sufficient area would remain on these parcels to allow the existing businesses to remain. The types of businesses located on parcels subject to partial acquisition include hotel/motels, restaurants, convenience stores, hotel/casinos, and retail stores. All parcels affected by a partial or full acquisition are listed and shown on maps in Appendix B. Access to all businesses affected by partial acquisition would be maintained during construction. Table 3.4-14 Displaced Businesses    Number of Parcels  Number of Businesses1  Number of Employees  Transportation Improvements (Acquisition for ROW)  A: No Build (No Project)  NA  NA  NA  B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action)  4  4  14  C: Triangle One-Way  4  4  14  D: PSR Alternative 2  4  7  57  E: Skywalk  NA  NA  NA  Mixed-Use Development, including Replacement Housing (Acquisition for Mixed-Use Development Only)  A: No Build (No Project)  NA  NA  NA  B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action)  5  10  78  C: Triangle One-Way  5  10  78  D: PSR Alternative 2  1  3  21  E: Skywalk  NA  NA  NA  Note: NA = not applicable (no displacement would occur under Alternatives A and E). 1 For the transportation improvements, includes four motels under Alternatives B and C and two motels under Alternative D.

Because the project would construct replacement parking, the loss of existing parking at some businesses would not substantially affect operations at these businesses. TTD would provide relocation assistance to all eligible displaced businesses in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Act and the Relocation Assistance Law (see Section 3.4.1, “Community Character and Cohesion,” and Appendix F). As with the Residential Relocation Assistance Program described in Section 3.4.1 under “Regulatory Setting,” TTD would be required to employ all additional aid required to assist affected businesses with their relocation needs, including assistance in planning the logistics and executing the move of personal property and non-realty business property. Potential relocation benefits for a displaced business include a physical move, including packing and unpacking of all personal property and related expenses, to a new location. If appropriate, the move would include any dismantling or disconnection and reconnection at the replacement location. The costs to search for a new location and for reestablishment would also be reimbursable. In preparation of the Relocation Study (TTD 2012; see Appendix F), research was conducted in August and September 2014 in South Lake Tahoe to determine the availability of commercial space for sale or rent to accommodate the relocation of the businesses potentially affected by project implementation. The 2012 Relocation Study includes amendments through 2014. Research indicated that nine motel properties and nine retail commercial properties were available for sale (TTD 2012:22). The survey also indicated that 14 retail commercial units were available for rent, with units ranging in size from 350 sq. ft. to 6,995 sq. ft. (TTD 2012:22 – 23). The survey data of for-sale and rental properties for relocation of displaced motels and commercial businesses indicate that sufficient replacement resources are available relative to the number of potential displacements within the project site. Enough inventory exists in the South Shore for businesses to relocate with implementation of Alternative B transportation improvements, such that construction of replacement motel or commercial properties would not be required. For this reason, and because TTD would provide relocation assistance to displaced businesses in accordance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law, the effects of Alternative B transportation improvements on displaced businesses would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, compliance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law and the design features of Alternative B transportation improvements, including replacement housing, would avoid or minimize effects on displacement of businesses such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Implementation of Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would reroute the existing US 50 through an existing neighborhood and would extend the realigned US 50 behind the casinos. This alternative could also involve construction of new mixed-use development containing residential and commercial uses at three locations adjacent to the realigned US 50 (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-10).  Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in full acquisition of five additional parcels that would result in displacement of an additional 10 businesses, which consist of hotel/motels, restaurants, convenience stores, hotel/casinos, and retail stores. All parcels affected by a full acquisition are listed and shown on maps in Appendix B. This alternative would displace a total of 14 businesses for transportation improvements and mixed-use development (see Table 2-4, Table 3.4-14, Exhibit 3.4-2, and Appendix B). The mixed-use development would not result in any partial acquisitions. Under Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as described above, TTD would be required to provide relocation assistance to all eligible displaced businesses in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Act and the Relocation Assistance Law. The Relocation Study (TTD 2012; see Appendix F) determined that enough inventory exists in the South Shore for businesses to relocate without requiring construction of replacement motel or commercial properties. The mixed-use development, which includes commercial uses, is not proposed because additional commercial space must be constructed to serve as a replacement commercial property for displaced businesses. However, if the businesses were interested, they could be relocated to commercial space in the mixed-use development. Because TTD would provide relocation assistance to displaced businesses in accordance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law, the effects of Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, on displaced businesses would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, compliance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law and the design features of Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would avoid or minimize effects on business displacement such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for business displacement as described for the replacement housing on the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential impacts on business displacement would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would have a less-than-significant impact on business displacement. For the purposes of NEPA, compliance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law and the design features of Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would avoid or minimize effects on business displacement, including affordable housing, such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Implementation of Alternative C transportation improvements would reroute the existing US 50 through an existing neighborhood and would extend the realigned US 50 behind the casinos. Construction of the realigned US 50 and new US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection would necessitate acquisition of parcels and buildings containing businesses.  Implementation of Alternative C transportation improvements would result in the acquisition of the same parcels as Alternative B transportation improvements. Alternative C would result in full acquisition of four parcels that would result in displacing four hotel/motel businesses (see Table 2-2, Table 3.4-14, Exhibit 3.4-3, and Appendix B). Although this alternative would result in partial acquisitions of 19 parcels containing additional businesses (15 parcels in California and 4 parcels in Nevada), sufficient area would remain on these parcels to allow the existing businesses to remain. The types of businesses located on parcels subject to partial acquisition include hotel/motels, restaurants, convenience stores, hotel/casinos, and retail stores. All parcels affected by a partial or full acquisition are listed and shown on maps in Appendix B. Access to all businesses affected by partial acquisition would be maintained during construction.  Alternative C would result in removal of existing parking at some businesses; however, the project would construct replacement parking either on adjacent right-of-way areas or on other portions of the affected parcels (parking impacts are analyzed under Impact 3.6-10 in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation”).

This alternative could also involve construction of mixed-use development containing residential and commercial uses at three locations adjacent to the realigned US 50 (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-10). In addition to the full parcel acquisitions for the realigned US 50 ROW described above, implementation of Alternative C mixed-use development would also result in full acquisition of the same business parcels as Alternative B mixed-use development. Alternative C would result in full acquisition of five additional parcels that would result in displacing 10 businesses, which consist of hotel/motels, restaurants, convenience stores, hotel/casinos, and retail stores. All parcels affected by a full acquisition are listed and shown on maps in Appendix B. This alternative would displace a total of 14 total businesses for transportation improvements and mixed-use development (see Table 2-4, Table 3.4-14, Exhibit 3.4-3, and Appendix B). The mixed-use development would not result in any partial acquisitions. Under Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as described above, TTD would be required to provide relocation assistance to all eligible displaced businesses in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Act and the Relocation Assistance Law. The Relocation Study (TTD 2012; see Appendix F) determined that enough inventory exists in the South Shore for businesses to relocate without requiring construction of replacement motel or commercial properties. The mixed-use development, which includes commercial uses, is not proposed because additional commercial space must be constructed to serve as a replacement commercial property for displaced businesses.

The realigned US 50 and new US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection would necessitate acquisition of parcels and buildings containing businesses.  Full acquisition of four privately-owned parcels containing businesses would be required, resulting in the displacement of seven hotel/motel and commercial businesses under this alternative (see Table 2-2, Table 3.4-14, Exhibit 3.4-4, and Appendix B). Although this alternative would result in partial acquisitions of 14 parcels containing additional businesses (10 parcels in California and 4 parcels in Nevada), sufficient area would remain on these parcels to allow the existing businesses to remain. The types of businesses located on parcels subject to partial acquisition include hotel/motels, restaurants, convenience stores, hotel/casinos, and retail stores. All parcels affected by a partial or full acquisition are listed and shown on maps in Appendix B. Access to all businesses affected by partial acquisition would be maintained during construction. Alternative D would result in removal of existing parking at the Heavenly Village Center and Montbleu Resort and Casino as described in Impact 3.6-10 (see Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation”); however, the parking lots and garages for these businesses would continue to have sufficient parking to meet city and county standards. Thus, the loss of existing parking at some businesses would not substantially affect operations at these businesses. Under Alternative D transportation improvements, as described above, TTD would be required to provide relocation assistance to all eligible displaced businesses in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Act and the Relocation Assistance Law. The Relocation Study (TTD 2012; see Appendix F) determined that enough inventory exists in the South Shore for businesses to relocate without requiring construction of replacement motel or commercial properties. The effects of Alternative D transportation improvements on displaced businesses would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, compliance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law and the design features of Alternative D transportation improvements, including replacement housing, would avoid or minimize effects on displacement of businesses such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Implementation of Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would reroute the existing US 50 through an existing neighborhood and would extend the realigned US 50 behind the casinos. This alternative could also involve construction of new mixed-use development containing residential and commercial uses at three locations adjacent to the realigned US 50 (see Exhibits 2-11 and 2-12). In addition to the full parcel acquisitions for the realigned US 50 described above for Alternative D transportation improvements, implementation of Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in full acquisition of one additional parcel containing three businesses, which consist of restaurants and a convenience store. All parcels affected by a full acquisition are listed and shown on maps in Appendix B. This alternative would displace a total of 10 businesses for transportation improvements and mixed-use development (see Table 2-4, Table 3.4-14, Exhibit 3.4-4, and Appendix B). The mixed-use development would not result in any partial acquisitions. Under Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as described above, TTD would be required to provide relocation assistance to all eligible displaced businesses in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Act and the Relocation Assistance Law. The Relocation Study (TTD 2012; see Appendix F) determined that enough inventory exists in the South Shore for businesses to relocate without requiring construction of replacement motel or commercial properties. The mixed-use development, which includes commercial uses, is not proposed because additional commercial space must be constructed to serve as a replacement commercial property for displaced businesses. However, if the businesses were interested, they could be relocated to commercial space in the mixed-use development. Because TTD would provide relocation assistance to displaced businesses in accordance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law, the effects of Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, on displaced businesses would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, compliance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law and the design features of Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would avoid or minimize effects on business displacement such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for business displacement as described for the replacement housing on the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential impacts on business displacement would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would have a less-than-significant impact on business displacement. For the purposes of NEPA, compliance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law and the design features of Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would avoid or minimize effects on business displacement, including affordable housing, such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alternative E: Skywalk Implementation of Alternative E would result in development of a raised concrete deck over the entire width and length of existing US 50 between Stateline Avenue and the northern end of the Montbleu Resort that would be used by pedestrians along the casino corridor. Alternative E does not involve realignment of US 50 and would not require the acquisition of parcels that are occupied by existing businesses because the features of this alternative would be located within the existing ROW for US 50 through the casino corridor. There would be no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures No avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures are required to reduce effects on displacing housing units or businesses to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  For the purposes of NEPA, compliance with the Uniform Act and Relocation Assistance Law and the design features of the build alternatives would avoid or minimize effects related to displacing housing units or businesses such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. 3.4.3 Environmental Justice REGULATORY SETTING The federal regulations described below require the environmental justice effects of a project to be assessed. No other regional or local regulations apply to this analysis.  Federal Executive Order 12898 – Environmental Justice All projects involving a federal action (i.e., funding, permit, or land) must comply with Executive Order (EO) 12898, Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations, signed by President William J. Clinton on February 11, 1994. This EO directs federal agencies to take the appropriate and necessary steps to identify and address disproportionately high and adverse effects of federal projects on the health or environment of minority and low-income populations to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law. Low income is defined based on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services poverty guidelines. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the 2014 poverty level (i.e., identified as low income) was $23,850 for a family of four (FHWA et al. 2014:118).  Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC 2000d) prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. All considerations under Title VI and related statutes have been addressed in this project. FHWA is committed to upholding the mandates of Title VI as demonstrated by its Title VI Policy Statement, signed by the Director (see Appendix H, “Title VI Policy Statement”). FHWA Order 6640.23A, FHWA Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low Income Populations FHWA Order 6640.23A issued in 2012 establishes policies and procedures for FHWA to use in complying with EO 12898. This directive is limited to improving the internal management of the FHWA to ensure that all of its programs, operations, policies, and activities do not result in discrimination or disproportionately high and adverse effects on minority populations and low-income populations and provide public involvement opportunities for these populations. AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT The CIA study area for consideration of adverse effects on environmental justice populations was defined in Section 3.4.1, “Community Character and Cohesion” (FHWA et al. 2014). The CIA study area is limited to the area where direct and indirect adverse effects may occur. Direct impacts would be limited to parcels immediately adjacent to US 50, the intersecting roads, and the project footprint. To facilitate a statistical comparison and ensure that potential indirect impacts are considered, a larger CIA study area was defined that included the census blocks from the City of South Lake Tahoe, California Census Tract 316, Stateline CDP, and Nevada Census Tracts 17 and 18 (FHWA et al. 2014:27-29). The ethnic composition and poverty level for the CIA study area are identified in Table 3.4-1 and Table 3.4-5, respectively. DISPROPORTIONATE ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ON MINORITY AND LOW-INCOME POPULATIONS ANALYSIS Methods and Assumptions According to the Council on Environmental Quality’s (CEQ’s) Environmental Justice Guidance Under the National Environmental Policy Act (1997) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA; EPA 1998), agencies should consider the composition of the affected area to determine whether minority populations, low-income populations, or Indian tribes are present in the area affected by the locally preferred action, and if so, whether there may be disproportionately high and adverse environmental effects. Communities may be considered “minority” under EO 12898 if any of the following characteristics apply:  the cumulative percentage of minorities within the affected community is greater than 50 percent (this is the primary method of determining whether a community is a minority community), or  the cumulative percentage of minorities within the affected community is meaningfully greater than the minority population percentage in the general population or other appropriate unit of geographic analysis (this is a secondary method of determining whether a community is a minority community). According to EPA, either the county or state percentages can be used when considering the scope of the “general population.” A definition of “meaningfully greater” is not given by CEQ or EPA. EPA notes, however, that any affected area with a percentage of minorities greater than the state’s percentage is potentially a minority community, and any affected area with a minority percentage at least double that of the state is definitely a minority community under EO 12898. This environmental justice analysis applies the “meaningfully greater” methodology and determines whether or not minority populations in the study area are meaningfully greater than those populations in the City of South Lake Tahoe, Stateline CDP, and Douglas County:  The study area is considered to be a minority community if the percentage of minority residents within the study area is more than 10 percentage points higher than those for the city, Stateline CDP, or county. Communities may be considered “low income” under EO 12898 if one of the following characteristics applies:   A person whose median household income is at or below the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services poverty guidelines (this is the primary method of determining whether a community is low income), or   Other conditions indicate that a low-income community is present within the census tract (this is the secondary method of analysis determining whether a community is low income); examples may include limited access to health care, overburdened or aged infrastructure, and dependence on subsistence living. In most cases, the primary method will suffice to determine whether a low-income community exists. However, when income may be just above the poverty line or where a low-income pocket appears likely, the secondary method of analysis may be warranted. The analysis below does also utilize information about the neighborhood collected for preparation of the Relocation Study. This environmental justice analysis applies the following methodology to determine the presence of a low income community:  The study area is considered to have low-income populations if the percentage of residents within the study area who are living below the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services defined poverty threshold is equal to or greater than that for the city, Stateline CDP, or Douglas County. EO 12898 requires that the analysis of environmental effects that would disproportionately affect the environmental justice population consider only adverse environmental effects to the human population (e.g., noise effects). Accordingly, the resource sections of the EIR/EIS/EIS were reviewed to determine applicable impacts related to environmental justice. Alternative A would result in a continuation of existing conditions. Implementation of Alternative E would be limited to the portion of the tourist core that contains the resort-casinos and the areas directly adjacent to either end of the resort-casinos, and would not affect any residential community. Alternatives A and E would not result in any disproportionate direct or indirect effects on a minority population. For these reasons, Alternatives A and E are not discussed further below. Environmental Justice Outreach EO 12898 requires that federal agencies ensure effective public participation and access to information. Consequently, a key component of compliance with EO 12898 is outreach to potentially affected minority and low-income populations to discover issues of importance that otherwise may not be apparent. Outreach to the affected community has been and will continue to be conducted as part of the decision-making process for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project (Table 3.4-15). Outreach efforts conducted to date are also documented in Section 1.5, “Summary of Public Involvement.” Table 3.4-15 Public Involvement Activities and Outreach to Minority and Low-Income Populations  Project Milestone  General Timeframe  Outreach Activity  Description  Community Review Committee Meetings  2013  Community stakeholder input  Provided opportunity for community members to provide input into alternatives development and evaluation process  Business Review Committee Meetings  2013  Business stakeholder input  Provided opportunity for business owners to provide input into alternatives development and evaluation process  Project Development Team (PDT) Meetings  March, August, December 2011 May 2012 January 2013 December 2014 January 2015  Agency stakeholder input  Refined the project’s purpose and need, developed and evaluated alternatives, reviewed technical studies, and participated in public workshops and community involvement meetings  Public Open House Events  November 2014 December 2015 January 2016 February 2016  Public workshops  Informal opportunities for the public to view project details, ask questions, and provide comments on project design  Connect South Shore  2014-2015  Interactive website  Online “open house” to allow the public to weigh in on preferences for the design and project alternatives   Relocation Study Community Meeting  2013  Informational meeting  Provided information to residents and business owners about the ROW acquisition and relocation process; opportunity for residents and business owners to ask questions; included a Tagalog interpreter  Relocation Study for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project  2013-2014  Direct contact  Door-to-door short interviews with residents to obtain a sampling of relocation needs; interviews were conducted by a bilingual interviewer who speaks Spanish and English  Economic Analysis of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project  2013  Direct contact, written survey   Outreach to local business representatives to obtain information regarding business and marketing practices, primary revenue sources, and customer behavior; a survey was also distributed to businesses to better understand business dynamics in the study area  South Lake Tahoe Family Resource Center Community Meeting  2016  Informational meeting  Presentation and question and answer session on the project and relocation process to residents in the Rocky Point and Bijou neighborhoods.

These flyers were also available online and at the public workshops conducted for the project. The informational meeting about the ROW acquisition and relocation process included Tagalog and Spanish interpreters. Interviews with residents conducted for the Relocation Study (see Appendix F) were in English and Spanish. Significance Criteria The environmental justice analysis was prepared in accordance with the applicable guidance, including Guidance Under the National Environmental Policy Act (CEQ 1997) and the Standard Environmental Reference, Volume 4, “Community Impact Assessment” (Caltrans 2011). Consistent with this guidance, a significant environmental impact determination is not made. Rather, there is a determination of whether the project would result in:  disproportionately high and adverse effects on minority and low-income population groups. FHWA defines a disproportionately high and adverse effect on minority and low-income populations as an adverse effect that either:  is predominately borne by a minority population and/or a low-income population; or  will be suffered by the minority population and/or low-income population and is appreciably more severe or greater in magnitude than the adverse effect that will be suffered by the non-minority population and/or non-low-income population. Environmental Justice Effects of the Project Alternatives Minority and Low-Income Population The analysis of environmental justice impacts focuses on adverse effects on the residential population in the Rocky Point neighborhood west of the Heavenly Village Center; no other minority and low-income populations would be affected by implementation of the project. This neighborhood is the only residential area within the study area that would experience adverse impacts from the project. The proportion of the population in the CIA study area identified as minority is more than 10 percent greater than that identified as minority within the City of South Lake Tahoe and Douglas County; 54.8 percent of the CIA study area population are minorities compared to 18.1 to 40.0 percent of the populations in Douglas County and the City of South Lake Tahoe, respectively (see Table 3.4-1). The proportion of the population in the Stateline CDP that are minorities is 51.3 percent, which is similar to that for the CIA study area. The data collected for the CIA study area represent the minority characteristics of the population living in an area slightly larger than the area directly affected by Alternatives B, C, and D; however, survey data collected from residents living within the area directly affected support the results that this area has a substantially greater proportion of the population that are minorities compared to the city, county, and Stateline CDP population (TTD 2012:16). For these reasons, the neighborhood directly affected by the project has a substantially higher proportion of the population that are minorities compared to the city, county, and Stateline CDP, such that an environmental justice concern arises because the minority population would disproportionately experience adverse environmental effects. The census data collected for the CIA study area show that 16.0 percent of the population is below poverty level, which is only slightly less than the proportion of the population in the City of South Lake Tahoe (18.2 percent) that are below poverty level. However, the proportion of the population below poverty level in the neighborhood directly affected by Alternatives B, C, and D is likely even greater because, although the survey results provided limited information about income levels in the neighborhood, they do indicate that the proportion of the neighborhood population below the poverty level may be higher than what is reflected in the census data. For example, the results of the survey conducted for the Relocation Study show that there is overcrowding in some of the housing units within the neighborhood and that the average household size is 2.92 to 2.96 persons per household (TTD 2012:13-14), which is higher than the average household size described by census data compiled for the CIA study area (2.28 persons per household). Overcrowded conditions and high average household size can be indicators of high housing costs and the efforts of individuals to reduce their housing cost burden as a result of having a low income. For these reasons, the neighborhood directly affected by the project would have a substantively higher proportion of the population below the poverty level compared to the city, county, and Stateline CDP population, such that an environmental justice concern arises because a low-income population would disproportionately experience adverse environmental effects. Roadway Realignment and Potential Mixed-Use Development (Alternatives B, C, and D) As a result of construction and operation of Alternatives B, C, and D, including the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, the following beneficial and adverse environmental effects on the residents of the Rocky Point neighborhood to the west of the Heavenly Village Center would occur and were analyzed in their respective resource sections in this EIR/EIS/EIS. In addition to the adverse effects described below, the minority and low-income population that lives in the Rocky Point neighborhood could experience some effects that would not be adverse for the purposes of NEPA, and have been determined to be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. These impacts are related to construction traffic impacts (Impact 3.6-6 in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation”), emergency access (Impacts 3.6-8 and 3.6-16 in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation”), hazardous materials (3.12-1 in Section 3.12, “Hazards, Hazardous Materials, and Risk of Upset”), air quality (Impact 3.13-3 in Section 3.13, “Air Quality”), and short-term construction noise (Impact 3.15-1 in Section 3.15, “Noise and Vibration”). With the exception of Impact 3.13-3 (“Long-term, long-term mobile-source carbon monoxide emissions”), these impacts are short-term and temporary because they would only occur during construction of the project. As described in the analysis for these impacts, design features and other minimization efforts would be incorporated into the project through standard practices, such as TRPA’s Best Construction Practices Policy for the Minimization of Exposure to Construction-Generated Noise and Ground Vibration among others, and in accordance with regulatory requirements, such as federal, state, and local regulations for the transport, storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials among other requirements, related to these impacts. However, these effects, which would not be adverse, would be primarily focused within the Rocky Point neighborhood and, therefore, collectively contribute to a potential disproportionately high and adverse effects on a minority and low-income population. The more substantial adverse effects on this population are discussed in more detail below. As described in Impact 3.4-1, above, implementation of the US 50 realignment would adversely affect the community character of the neighborhood directly adjacent to the realigned US 50 with the physical division of the community, exposure to traffic noise, changes to the scenic quality and visual character, and removal of residences. These project alternatives would be required to implement Mitigation Measure 3.4-1 to minimize effects related to traffic noise, scenic quality, and visual character; however, effects on scenic quality and character of the neighborhood along realigned US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Montreal Road would remain adverse, for the purposes of NEPA, and significant and unavoidable, for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, and traffic noise exposure would exceed applicable noise standards. For these reasons, the alternatives’ adverse effects on community character in this neighborhood would remain a disproportionate and unavoidable adverse effect. Implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in direct effects that would disproportionately affect this population related to displacement by these alternatives. As described in Impact 3.4-4, the residents of 78 to 88 housing units (depending on alternative) would be displaced by the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, which includes 70 to 74 affordable housing units. Prior to construction of transportation improvements in California and prior to displacing residents, TTD would construct replacement housing units, including deed-restricted affordable housing units, equal to the number displaced by the transportation improvements and mixed-use development. The replacement housing would be completed before taking down existing housing and constructing the transportation improvements in California so that residents displaced by the project may be relocated to the newly constructed housing if they so choose during the relocation process. TTD’s preferred location for replacement housing would be within the project site limits, specifically within the mixed-use redevelopment sites identified in Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 (see Chapter 2). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. TTD would relocate displaced residents in accordance with the Uniform Act.  The potential risk of an accidental release of hazardous substances that could adversely affect human health or the environment would be reduced to less than significant with implementation of Mitigation Measures 3.12-2a, 3.12-2b, 3.12-2c, and 3.12-2d (see Impact 3.12-2 in Section 3.12, “Hazards, Hazardous Materials, and Risk of Upset”). Short-term construction-related air pollution emission impacts, which includes NOx and fugitive dust (PM10 and PM2.5), would be reduced to less than significant with implementation of Mitigation Measures 3.13-1a and 3.13-1b (see Impact 3.13-1 in Section 3.13, “Air Quality”). As discussed in Impact 3.13-4 in Section 3.13, “Air Quality,” these alternatives would result in less than 40,000 ADT during the summer peak season for all affected roadway segments, with less than 3 percent truck trips. In accordance with FHWA and Caltrans guidance, projects that do not result in more than 140,000 AADT have a low potential to result in impacts from mobile source air toxics. Therefore, the project would not result in a significant health risk impact to sensitive receptors in the project vicinity.  Implementation of these alternatives would result in exposing receptors in this minority and low-income population to traffic noise at levels that exceed applicable FHWA, Caltrans, TRPA, and City of South Lake Tahoe traffic noise standards (see Impact 3.15-3 in Section 3.15, “Noise and Vibration”). Construction of the alternatives would include Mitigation Measure 3.15-3a (Alternative B), Mitigation Measure 3.15-3b (Alternative C), or Mitigation Measure 3.15-3c (Alternative D) that requires implementation of specific performance requirements and could include additional noise-reduction features. The selection and design of specific traffic noise reduction measures shall be supported by a site-specific mitigation assessment conducted by a qualified acoustical engineer or consultant selected by the project proponent and shall be fully funded by the project proponent. Relatively large noise reductions would be needed at receptors located along both sides of the segment of realigned US 50 that would pass through the Rocky Point neighborhood; however, it may not be feasible to construct sound barriers along both sides of the highway that meet aesthetic and snow removal requirements and avoid measurable levels of noise reflection. Therefore, exposure of the minority and low-income population to traffic noise above traffic noise standards would remain a disproportionate and unavoidable adverse effect.  Some areas of mixed-use development Sites 1, 2, and 3, which are the preferred locations for construction of replacement housing for displaced residents and presumably including residents that are considered low-income and/or minority from the Rocky Point neighborhood, would be located within the 60 CNEL traffic noise contour (see Impact 3.15-4 in Section 3.15, “Noise and Vibration”). If any outdoor activity areas were located within this distance without any intervening buildings or structures to provide noise protection, then they would be exposed to noise levels that exceed the noise standard established by the City of South Lake Tahoe under cumulative-plus-Alternative B conditions. Moreover, traffic on local roadways could also contribute to noise on the sites (i.e., Lake Tahoe Boulevard west of Site 1, Pioneer Trail between Sites 1 and 2, Heavenly Village Way north of Site 3). Through construction of design measures identified in Mitigation Measure 3.15-4 that reduce exposure to traffic noise levels exceeding 60 CNEL at all common outdoor activity areas and the outdoor activity areas developed on the redevelopment sites, this impact would be reduced to less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA and would not be adverse for the purposes of NEPA. Additional alternatives were considered (see Table 2-5 in Chapter 2), including construction of tunnels either underneath the tourist core or the Rocky Point neighborhood and shifting the realignment to the west. However, these alternatives would likely not avoid all of the adverse effects on environmental justice populations. For example, with the tunnel alternatives, the construction-related effects would likely be the same or greater in magnitude than would occur with Alternatives B, C, and D. A tunnel underneath the neighborhood would still result in displacing residents. Alternatives that shift the realignment would likely shift the effects to another similar population. Furthermore, moving the transportation improvements to another location would result in those improvements being located where they would not provide comparable improvements to the circulation system and opportunities for redevelopment and revitalization in the tourist core. Direct effects on the environmental justice populations in the Rocky Point neighborhood would include displacing residents, exposure to risk of an accidental release of hazardous substances, short-term construction-related air pollution emission impacts, and exposure to traffic noise levels exceeding 60 CNEL at outdoor activity areas would be substantially reduced through implementation of the Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures discussed in Sections 3.4, “Community Impacts,” 3.12, “Hazards, Hazardous Materials, and Risk of Upset,” 3.13, “Air Quality,” and Section 3.15, “Noise and Vibration.” However, effects related to adverse changes to community character and physical division of an existing community and traffic noise exposure would remain adverse for the purposes of NEPA and significant and unavoidable for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA with no other mitigation available to further reduce to the extent feasible these environmental consequences. For the reasons described herein, Alternatives B, C, and D would potentially result in disproportionately high and adverse effects on a minority and low-income population within the project site in the Rocky Point neighborhood. Project Benefits As described in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation,” implementation of Alternatives B and D transportation improvements would result in LOS improvements at several intersections compared to existing conditions (see Impact 3.6-2). Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would support the Region’s pursuit of its goal to reduce VMT below 1981 levels (see Impacts 3.6-4 and 3.6-14). Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would result in beneficial impacts on bicycle/pedestrian infrastructure and connectivity (see Impact 3.6-5); improvements in transit operations (see Impact 3.6-6); and improvements in vehicular, pedestrian, and bicycle safety (see Impact 3.6-8).  Additionally, the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would help promote high-density redevelopment consistent with the intent of the TCAP and Regional Plan to encourage redevelopment, support a vibrant walkable pedestrian-oriented community, and environmental improvements within the tourist core (see Impact 3.2-1 in Section 3.2, “Land Use”). Potential Disproportionately High and Adverse Effects As described above and in the respective resource sections of this EIR/EIS/EIS, mitigation measures would be implemented with Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to reduce the magnitude of the impacts such that there are no residual, unavoidable adverse effects on the minority and low-income population related to risk of accidental release of hazardous materials, short-term construction-related air quality impacts, displacement impacts on residents within the Rocky Point neighborhood, short-term construction noise, and exposure to noise levels in common outdoor areas that exceed TRPA noise standards. However, exposure to traffic noise and community character and cohesion impacts could not be mitigated and are unavoidable adverse environmental effects that would disproportionately affect the minority and low-income populations in the Rocky Point neighborhood.  Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures As described above under “Roadway Realignment and Potential Mixed-Use Development (Alternatives B, C, and D),” Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would be required to implement mitigation measures to reduce impacts related to adverse effects on community character and physical division of an existing community, risk of accidental release of hazardous materials, short-term construction-related air pollution emissions, short-term construction noise, and operational traffic noise. These mitigation and abatement measures include:   Mitigation Measure 3.4-1 (see Section 3.4.1, “Community Character and Cohesion”);  Mitigation Measures 3.12-2a, 3.12-2b, 3.12-2c, and 3.12-2d (see Section 3.12, “Hazards, Hazardous Materials, and Risk of Upset”);  Mitigation Measures 3.13-1a and 3.13-1b (see Section 3.13, “Air Quality”); and  Mitigation Measures 3.15-3a (Alternative B), 3.15-3b (Alternative C), or 3.15-3c (Alternative D) and Mitigation Measure 3.15-4 (see Section 3.15, “Noise and Vibration”). Community Outreach and Public Involvement In developing the project alternatives and throughout the environmental review process, community outreach and public involvement included scoping meetings, public workshops, website, flyers, notices, and public review and comment on the draft environmental document described above in Table 3.4-15 and in Section 1.5, “Summary of Public Involvement.” Specific outreach efforts that have targeted the minority and low-income population affected by the project through development of the relocation study and informational materials have been translated to Tagalog and Spanish and provided to affected residents and the public. Additionally, local elected officials and stakeholder agencies were consulted for their input. Review of the draft environmental document and development of the project after its approval will also continue to provide opportunities for public participation. For example, individuals may submit comments on this draft environmental document in writing or at public hearings, additional public hearings will be held for the final environmental document.  Title VI The project will be developed in accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which provides that no person in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under, any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. In addition, the project will be developed in conformity with related statutes and regulations mandating that no person in the State of California shall, on grounds of race, color, sex, age, national origin, or disabling condition, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity administered by or on behalf of Caltrans. Other Measures to Minimize Adverse Effects As described in Section 1.3, “Purpose, Need, and Objectives,” Alternatives B, C, and D would help address a need for traffic improvements to study area intersections and roadway segments that are currently operating at marginally acceptable levels during a typical summer peak hour. There is currently a need in the study area for enhanced connectivity, transit use, walkability, and bicycle use to reduce dependence on private automobiles. Also, pedestrian safety improvements are needed. Improvements to pedestrian facilities, bicycle lanes, and transit services are needed to connect the outlying residential and retail-commercial uses with employment and entertainment facilities, including hotels and gaming interests. Currently, US 50 through the project site has no bicycle lanes, and sidewalks are either not large enough to meet the increased demand or do not exist. These alternatives would include new bicycle and new or reconstructed pedestrian facilities in the project site, including a new pedestrian overcrossing developed with input from stakeholders that would connect the tourist core to Van Sickle Bi-State Park. For these reasons, there is a substantial need for the project related to safety and connectivity for all users. Table 2-5 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives,” includes analysis of alternatives that were considered but eliminated from further discussion. This list of alternatives includes consideration of the following alternatives that would eliminate or reduce impacts on the minority and low-income population located west of the Heavenly Village Center:   2004 US 50/ Stateline Area Transportation Study - Alternatives A, B, and C,   VA Study - Tunnel Beneath Residential Area Alternative,   Open House Alternative 2 - The Wildwood Alternative,   Open House Alternative 3 - Heavenly Village Way Alternative,   Open House Alternative 4 - The Lakeview Alternative, and   VA Study - Tunnel Beneath Existing US 50 Alternative. These alternatives were rejected for reasons that included:   inability to meet project objectives;  additional adverse effects on the environment;   constructability and cost impacts that would outweigh the benefits;   challenging construction techniques;  displacement of residents shifted to other neighborhoods; and/or  would not meet Caltrans design guidelines. As part of the project planning and development process that has occurred over the past several years, measures have been incorporated into the project to avoid or minimize impacts to the surrounding community. The potential mixed-use development that is proposed in addition to the transportation improvements was developed to address the displacement impacts of the transportation improvements and support revitalization and redevelopment in the study area. Furthermore, public concern about displacing residents and available affordable housing has resulted in revising the project to include construction of replacement housing for displaced residents prior to construction of transportation improvements in California and prior to displacement of residents. This would result in no net loss of housing, including affordable housing, in the South Shore area and provides deed-restricted affordable housing that enhances the long-term supply of affordable housing for the area. The preferred location for construction of replacement housing are the three sites identified for the mixed-use development. If the replacement housing cannot be constructed at these locations, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area outside of the study area prior to displacing residents and constructing transportation improvements in California. Environmental Justice Determination There is no further practicable mitigation or alternative that would reduce or avoid the disproportionately high and adverse effects from traffic noise and community character and cohesion impacts on minority and low-income populations or other effects of the project described above that are not adverse. The project would meet the needs in the study area for improving study area intersections and roadway segments; enhancing connectivity, transit use, walkability, and bicycle use; and improving pedestrian safety. In spite of the project’s benefits, other measures included in the project to minimize adverse effects, and additional planning efforts to identify alternatives that would eliminate or reduce impacts, the preliminary determination from FHWA is that the project would still have a disproportionately high and adverse effect on minority and low-income populations in the Rocky Point neighborhood.    This page intentionally left blank.  3.5 PUBLIC SERVICES AND UTILITIES This section describes the existing public services and utilities in and around the study area, presents analysis of potential impacts resulting from the project alternatives, and identifies mitigation measures for those impacts determined to be significant. In particular, it addresses impacts on water supply, wastewater treatment and disposal, electricity, natural gas, solid waste, law enforcement, fire and emergency services, and school facilities. Federal, state, and local regulations related to public services and utilities are summarized. The primary issues raised during scoping included the following:  Commenter describes Nevada regulations for water rights, new water supplies, and monitoring wells. The commenter also states that any water used for construction, dust control, or maintenance should be provided by an established utility or under permit or waiver issued by the State Engineer’s Office.   Commenters express concern regarding potential utility conflicts between the project and South Tahoe Public Utility District (STPUD) sewer and water distribution systems, fire hydrants, and storm drain systems. Commenter states that if the finish grade of the proposed improvements are similar to, or higher than, the existing grade, then the waterlines would generally not require relocation.   Commenter states that a major cluster of system valves is located at the proposed US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection and that relocation of these main lines would interrupt STPUD’s capacity to provide fire flows to a portion of their service area. Commenter suggests relocating the proposed intersection or relocating the valve assemblies outside of the proposed intersection.  Commenter asserts that water meter boxes at buildings proposed for acquisition would need to be abandoned and other meter boxes would likely need to be relocated.  Commenter asserts that the storm drain elements of the project would likely require the relocation of certain sections of water lines, typically by lowering the water line in the immediate vicinity of the storm drain improvement. Commenter suggests that the project engineering design and grading plans and STPUD water line profiles should be reviewed for conflict determination and that storm drain improvements for the project be designed around the existing gravity sewer network.  Commenter asserts that the environmental document should assess potential impacts on snow removal services, including requirements for an increase in snow removal needs and project design elements that would require special equipment, techniques, or operations for snow removal. Most of these issues are addressed in this section; however, stormwater issues and snow removal are addressed in Section 3.10, “Water Quality and Stormwater Runoff.” The primary sources of information presented in this section were TRPA, El Dorado County, and Douglas County planning documents, goals, and policies; through consultation with representatives of public service and utility providers; and the following documents:   Housing Analysis – Alternative B, C and D (Massey 2016);   Community Impact Assessment (FHWA et al. 2014);   Relocation Study for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project (TTD 2012); and   Economic Analysis of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project (TTD 2013). Cumulative public service and utility impacts are addressed in Section 3.19, “Cumulative Impacts.” The potential for impacts on recreational facilities is addressed in Section 3.3, “Parks and Recreational Facilities,” and potential impacts on groundwater and stormwater drainage are addressed in Section 3.10, “Water Quality and Stormwater Runoff.” Impacts associated with construction to upgrade existing infrastructure or install new infrastructure on the project site are discussed in Section 3.11, “Geology, Soils, Land Capability, and Coverage.” Access for emergency services during construction and operation of the project is addressed in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation.” 3.5.1 Regulatory Setting The following provides an overview of laws and regulations related to public services and utilities that are applicable to the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project. FEDERAL No federal regulations related to public services and utilities are applicable to the alternatives evaluated in this EIR/EIS/EIS. TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY Lake Tahoe Regional Plan The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) Lake Tahoe Regional Plan (Regional Plan) describes the needs and goals of the Lake Tahoe Region, and provides statements of policy to guide decision-making as it affects the Region’s resources and remaining capacities. The intent of the Regional Plan is to help guide decision-making as it affects the growth and development of the Lake Tahoe Region. The Regional Plan affects the planning activities of numerous governmental jurisdictions and utility service districts (TRPA 2012b).  Goals and Policies The Public Services and Facilities Element of the TRPA Regional Plan includes goals and policies related to the provision of adequate public services and utilities to meet the needs of existing and new development, and protection of surface and groundwater from solid and liquid municipal waste. Goals and policies address adequate water supplies and conservation (Policies PS-1.3, PS-2.1, PS-2.3; TRPA 2012b:6-2 – 6-3), the prohibition of municipal or industrial wastewater entering the surface water and groundwater of the Tahoe Region (Policy PS-3.1; TRPA 2012b:6-3), and protection of the public health, safety, and general welfare of the region, educational and public safety services (Policy PS-4.1; TRPA 2012b:6-4). The full text of these goals and policies, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with the goals and policies, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.” Code of Ordinances Chapter 33, Grading and Construction, of the TRPA Code applies to grading, excavation, filling, clearing of vegetation, and disturbance of the soil, and protection of vegetation during construction. In accordance with Code Section 33.3.4, the methods of disposal of solid or liquid materials, including soil, silt, clay, sand, or other organic or earthen materials, shall be reviewed and approved by TRPA. These methods of disposal shall include, but are not limited to:   temporary stockpiling of all or some of the topsoil on the site for use on areas to be revegetated;   disposal of the material at a location approved by TRPA; and  export of the materials outside the Region.  Provisions of Chapter 33 regarding disposal of construction materials would apply to those portions of the project located within the area under the land use authority of TRPA.  Although TRPA does not specifically regulate the provision of electrical and natural gas services in the Lake Tahoe Basin, Code Section 27.5 directs that projects proposing a new structure, or reconstruction or expansion of an existing structure, designed or intended for human occupancy shall be served by facilities to provide adequate electrical supply.  Arrangements for the design and installation of any needed additional natural gas facilities must be made in accordance with the rules and regulations set forth by the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada. Natural gas service would be provided to the project site by Southwest Gas Corporation (SGC). Once the project is approved for construction, SGC would require pre-construction review of site trenching and roadway improvement plans to determine the natural gas meter locations and specifications. Water Service Section 32.4 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances contains a basic water service requirement for projects proposing a new structure, or reconstruction or expansion of an existing structure, designed or intended for human occupancy, specifically directing that such projects shall have adequate water rights and water supply systems.  According to Code Section 32.4.2, adequate fire flow for a project in the Tourist Core Area Plan requires 750-1,000 gallons per minute (gpm) over a 2-hour period at 20 pounds per square inch (psi) residual pressure. Wastewater Service Section 32.5 of the TRPA Code specifically directs that projects that would generate wastewater shall be served by facilities for the treatment and export of wastewater from the Lake Tahoe Basin. To be considered served, the project must have a service connection to transport wastewater from the parcel to a treatment plant. Electrical Service Section 32.6 of the TRPA Code requires that adequate electrical supply shall be served to structures intended for human occupancy.  Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities TRPA has not established any environmental threshold standards related to public services and utilities. Tourist Core Area Plan No goals and policies from the Tourist Core Area Plan are applicable to public service or utility aspects of the alternatives evaluated in this EIR/EIS/EIS. South Shore Area Plan No goals and policies in the South Shore Area Plan are applicable to public services or utility aspects of the alternatives evaluated in this EIR/EIS/EIS. STATE California Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act of 1970 The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act of 1970 prohibits the use of reclaimed wastewater within the Lake Tahoe Basin. Wastewater is transported out of the Basin from the STPUD Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) to Alpine County, and no reclaimed water is imported back into the Basin. Public Resources Code Sections 4125 and 4102 – State Responsibility Areas The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection implements statewide laws aimed at reducing wildfire hazards in wildland-urban interface areas. These laws, based on fire hazard assessment and zoning, apply to State Responsibility Areas, which are defined as areas in which the state has primary financial responsibility for preventing and suppressing fires. The determination of state responsibility is made by the State Board of Forestry in accordance with Sections 4125 and 4102 of the California Public Resources Code. Fire protection outside State Responsibility Areas is the responsibility of federal or local jurisdictions.  Public Resources Code 4216 – Excavations Public Resources Code Section 4216 regulates excavations potentially affecting underground utilities, including notification requirements by excavators, operator response requirements, and excavation practices. In accordance with Section 4216.1, every operator of a subsurface installationsuch as water lines, gas lines, and sewer linesmust become a member of, participate in, and share in the costs of a regional notification center. Underground Service Alert Northern California provides services to the study area. Any person planning to conduct an excavation must contact the regional notification center prior to commencing excavation (Section 4216.2). The operator of the utility must respond by locating and field marking the utility that may be affected by excavation (Section 4216.3). Section 4216.4 requires that the excavator determine the location of subsurface installations before using power-driven equipment for excavating or boring, and requires the excavator to notify the operator or emergency services, as appropriate, in the event that damage is discovered or caused by the excavator. Compliance with Section 4216 is required before commencement of excavation. California Code of Regulations Section 1541 – Construction Safety Related to Excavations California Code of Regulations Title 8, Chapter 4, Subchapter 4, Article 6, Section 1541 addresses construction safety orders related to excavations and requires safe conditions for workers involved with excavations or working near excavations. California Building Standards Code (Title 24) Energy consumption of new buildings in California is regulated by State Building Energy Efficiency Standards contained in the California Code of Regulations, Title 24, Part 2, Chapter 2-53. Title 24 applies to all new construction of both residential and nonresidential buildings, and regulates energy consumed for heating, cooling, ventilation, water heating, and lighting. The 2016 Building Energy Efficiency Standards have improved efficiency requirements from previous codes and the updated standards are expected to result in a statewide energy consumption reduction. Effective January 1, 2011, CALGreen became California’s first green building standards code. It is formally known as the California Green Building Standards Code, Title 24, Part 11, of the California Code of Regulations. CALGreen establishes mandatory minimum green building standards and includes more stringent optional provisions known as Tier 1 and Tier 2. Cities and counties, at their discretion, may adopt Tier 1 or Tier 2 as mandatory, or adopt and enforce other standards that are more stringent than the CALGreen Code. El Dorado County has adopted several modifications to both the residential and non-residential CALGreen mandatory sections. Where a local jurisdiction has not adopted a more stringent construction and demolition (C&D) ordinance, construction activities are required to implement Section 5.408 of the CALGreen Code. Under Section 5.408, construction activities are required to recycle and/or salvage for reuse a minimum of 65 percent of their nonhazardous C&D waste as of January 1, 2017. Applicable projects are required to prepare and implement a Construction Waste Management Plan, which is submitted to the local jurisdiction prior to issuance of building permits. The City of South Lake Tahoe does not currently have an adopted C&D waste management ordinance. Nevada No Nevada state regulations related to public services and utilities are applicable to the alternatives evaluated in this EIR/EIS/EIS.  LOCAL City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan The City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan (City of South Lake Tahoe 2011) includes goals and policies to ensure the timely maintenance, expansion, and upgrade of public facilities and services for the city (Policy PQP-1.7). In addition, new construction must meet minimum fire flow requirements, as set forth in the California Building and fire codes (Policy HS-2.5). The full text of these goals and policies, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with the goals and policies, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.” Douglas County Master Plan No Douglas County Master Plan goals or policies associated public services and utilities are applicable to the alternatives evaluated in this EIR/EIS/EIS.  3.5.2 Affected Environment WATER STPUD supplies water to the California portion of the study area. Water supplies associated with STPUD are provided by municipal wells to pump groundwater to the district’s service area. In 2015, 5,241 acre-feet of water was delivered to customers (STPUD 2016b:7).  Water is supplied to casino properties in Stateline by the Edgewood Water Company (EWC). Water supplies for EWC are provided from Lake Tahoe and are treated to meet drinking water quality standards. The average daily flow for the EWC, in 2015, was 601,715 gallons per day (gpd; 1.85 acre feet), and the peak daily flow was 1,612,400 gpd (5.0 acre feet; Tahoe Water Suppliers Association 2015:10). Based on the average daily flow for EWC, the estimated annual flow in 2015 was 219 million gallons (674 acre feet). The Lakeside Park Association serves the area along Stateline Avenue and the Lakeside Park area. In 2015, the average daily flow for Lakeside Park Association was 100,000 gpd (0.3 acre-feet) and the peak daily flow was 424,000 gallons (1.3 acre feet). Based on the average daily flow for Lakeside Park Association, the average annual flow in 2015 was 36.5 million gallons (112 acre feet). Existing water supply lines for STPUD in the study area are shown in Exhibit 3.5-1. Water supply lines are located in project site roads, including Pioneer Trail, Moss Road, Montreal Road, Echo Road, Fern Road, US 50, and Lake Parkway. Because Sites 1, 2, and 3 proposed for mixed-use development are located in the STPUD service area, the following discussion related to water supply is limited to the STPUD service area. Water supply is provided by 14 active supply wells. STPUD’s Domestic Water Supply Permit lists a total of 23 wells within its service area. In addition to the supply wells, STPUD maintains several standby wells, several sampling and monitoring wells, and several inactive wells. The storage and distribution system is comprised of 16 booster pump stations, 23 storage tanks, 26 pressure-reducing valves, and 320 miles of potable water pipe (STPUD 2016b:4).  Existing water supply infrastructure in the study area is shown in Exhibit 3.5-1. The Stateline water storage tanks, which supply water to the Rocky Point neighborhood west of Heavenly Village Center, are located off of Lake Parkway near the California-Nevada state line. Water supply infrastructure within the study area includes, but is not limited to, water supply lines, meter boxes, and hydrants.     Exhibit 3.5-1 Existing STPUD Water Supply and   Wastewater Conveyance Infrastructure STPUD water supply is provided by groundwater. Surface water supply agreements and rights have been granted to STPUD from Cold Creek (2,718 acre feet per year [afy]) and the Upper Truckee River and tributaries (4,424 afy); however, these supplies are not currently used because of water quality and supply reliability concerns. Water pumped from groundwater sources has historically been below the basin’s estimated safe yield of 9,528 afy and has been declining since 2007 (STPUD 2016b:12 - 13). Actual water demand in 2015 was 5,241 afy (STPUD 2016b:7). Projected population growth rates in the STPUD service area are based on the City of South Lake Tahoe’s Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP). The UWMP also recognizes that the TRPA Environmental Thresholds provide a growth control mechanism for the region, which in turn impacts projected water demands. Because the groundwater basin is not adjudicated, STPUD is not assigned an available supply. As described in the 2016 UWMP, STPUD will pump sufficient supply to meet the demands during each of the single and multiple dry year scenarios, without requiring a reduction in demand or supplemental supplies. Demand for the single dry year scenario is increased 10 percent as a conservative estimate of increased outdoor water usage during the first dry summer (STPUD 2016b:4, 6, 20). STPUD’s projected water supply and demand is shown in Table 3.5-1. Table 3.5-1 STPUD Water Supply and Demand (afy)    2020  2025  2030  2035  Normal Year   Supply Total  6,019  6,137  6,255  6,373  Total Water Demand  6,019  6,137  6,255  6,373  Single Dry Year   Supply Total  6,621   6,751   6,881   7,010  Total Water Demand  6,621   6,751   6,881   7,010  Multiple Dry Years  Supply Total  6,019  6,137  6,255  6,373  Total Water Demand  6,019  6,137  6,255  6,373  Source: STPUD 2016b:21  WASTEWATER Under the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, all sewage within the Lake Tahoe Basin must be collected, treated, and exported outside of the Basin. STPUD provides wastewater collection and treatment for the California portion of the study area. Wastewater services in the Nevada portion of the study area are provided by the Douglas County Sewer Improvement District (DCSID). The DCSID Sewer Ordinance regulates the installation and maintenance of private and community wastewater collection, treatment, and export.  Currently, the STPUD WWTP treats 4.0 million gallons per day (mgd) and has a total capacity of 7.7 mgd (STPUD 2016a). The wastewater treatment plan has 3.7 mgd of available wastewater treatment capacity. Existing wastewater conveyance infrastructure for STPUD in the study area is shown in Exhibit 3.5-1. There are a number of sewer gravity lines in project site roads, including Pioneer Trail, Moss Road, Montreal Road, Echo Road, Fern Road, US 50, and Lake Parkway. Several sewer maintenance holes are located within roadways throughout the Rocky Point neighborhood west of Heavenly Village Center.  ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS Electrical service to the study area is provided by NV Energy in Nevada and Liberty Utilities in California. Natural gas service is provided to the study area by Southwest Gas Corporation. SOLID WASTE South Tahoe Refuse (STR) provide waste removal services for the South Lake Tahoe area and Douglas County. STR collects more than 100,000 tons of waste each year. This waste is collected and sorted for recycling at the Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) located at STR’s transfer station in South Lake Tahoe, California. The MRF initiates or improves separation of aluminum cans, glass, plastics, cardboard, different grades of paper, tin, metals, appliances, milled wood, green waste, stumps, construction debris, and tires.  Waste collected by STR is delivered to Lockwood Regional Landfill in Storey County, Nevada. Lockwood Regional Landfill presently has a capacity of 302.5 million cubic yards over an area of 856.6 acres. Based on an April 2010 aerial survey, the landfill contained a waste volume of approximately 32.8 million cubic yards (Nevada Division of Environmental Protection [NDEP] 2016). The landfill receives approximately 5,000 tons of waste per day (NDEP 2016).  FIRE PROTECTION Fire protection for the study area is provided by the City of South Lake Tahoe Fire Department (SLTFD) and Tahoe-Douglas Fire Protection District (TDFPD). Each district operates four fire stations. The nearest fire stations to the study area are located at 1252 Ski Run Boulevard in South Lake Tahoe, California, and 702 Kingsbury Grade in Stateline, Nevada.  LAW ENFORCEMENT Law enforcement in South Lake Tahoe is provided by the South Lake Tahoe Police Department. Areas outside of the city limits, within the study area, are served by the Douglas County Sheriff Department. The California and Nevada Highway Patrols have jurisdiction over highways (e.g., US 50) within their respective states.  The Douglas County Sheriff’s Department operates the Tahoe Station, located approximately ½ mile east of the study area at 175 US 50 in Stateline, Nevada. A total of 122 people are employed by the Douglas County Sheriff’s Department, which includes four divisions: Administration, Investigations, Jail, and Patrol.  The South Lake Tahoe Police Department is located at 1352 Johnson Boulevard in South Lake Tahoe, California, approximately 2 miles southwest of the study area. There are currently 37 sworn officers and 11 supporting civilian positions (City of South Lake Tahoe 2016). PUBLIC SCHOOL FACILITIES Public school facilities in the vicinity of the study area that would serve the project are associated with Lake Tahoe Unified School District (LTUSD). The nearest LTUSD schools to the project are South Tahoe High, South Tahoe Middle, and Bijou Community Schools. Schools and enrollment statistics from 2010 through 2015 are provided in Table 3.5-2, as well as the maximum enrollment levels reported for each school since 1996.    Table 3.5-2 Public School Facility Enrollment  School  2010/2011  2011/2012  2012/2013  2013/2014  2014/2015  Maximum Enrollment 1996-20151  Bijou Community  492  521  538  578  582  611  Lake Tahoe Environmental Science Magnet  369  378  374  384  397  397  Mount Tallac High  82  96  93  87  87  109  Sierra House Elementary  450  471  491  503  502  641  South Tahoe High  1,139  1,054  1,001  1,040  984  1,630  South Tahoe Middle  859  820  817  787  817  1,393  Tahoe Valley Elementary  446  458  434  433  474  729  Transitional Learning Center   41  61  45  43  38  173  Total  3,878  3,859  3,793  3,855  3,881  5,683  1 Maximum number of students enrolled during a school year between 1996 and 2015.

Any potential effects of the build alternatives’ transportation improvements on public services and utilities would occur only as a result of construction; operational conditions of the roadways would be the same as existing conditions. Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, could result in impacts from a net increase in population and new residential and commercial uses. These potential effects are discussed further below. The environmental effects of the potential revitalization benefits associated with the project, which could include increased visitation and associated additional demand for public services and utilities, would be considered as part of full buildout of the Tourist Core Area Plan and were previously assessed (City of South Lake Tahoe 2013:6 – 7, 17 – 18). The project alternatives’ projections for utility requirements are based on the following assumptions:  Water supply projections were modeled using typical water demand factors for single-family residential, multi-family residential, and tourist accommodation unit (TAU) development (Coolidge, pers. comm., 2016a).   Projections for wastewater treatment flows were modeled using typical wastewater flow factors for single-family residential and commercial uses (Coolidge and Goligoski, pers. comm., 2016). The overall model is based on buildout identified by the general plans in effect at the time of the model development, which consisted of the City of South Lake Tahoe 1999 General Plan, the 2008 General Plan Housing Element Public Review Draft, and the El Dorado County 2004 General Plan (Coolidge, pers. comm., 2016c). The buildout plan included flows from every parcel that can contribute wastewater. With that said, the Stateline area is unique due to the identified redevelopment in the area, which causes projects to be evaluated at a project level, as has been done for Alternative D. Estimates for existing wastewater flows are based on typical wastewater flows for individual sewer units (Coolidge, pers. comm., 2016a, 2016b). The ability of the STPUD wastewater collection system to convey flows from the mixed-use development was modeled for Alternative D with mixed-use development because this alternative could result in the greatest increase in development over existing conditions and did not account for a reduction in wastewater flows resulting from displaced hotel/motel uses; therefore, the analysis of the mixed-use development wastewater impacts on wastewater collection is conservative because it considers a worst-case scenario. Final design of the alternatives with mixed-use development could result in a smaller number of housing units and amount of commercial floor area than described in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives.”  Solid waste disposal estimates were determined through quantity estimates assumed under the Regional Plan Update EIS. This assumes that new jobs would be retail-based and would generate 1.9 tons of waste per year per employee, and that each new resident would generate 1.39 tons of waste per year (TRPA 2012a:3.13-10). Based on estimates by the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle), 1 cubic yard of waste, compacted in a landfill, weighs 0.75 ton (CalRecycle 2016).   The amount of demolition waste resulting in haul trips was estimated based on assumptions used in the air quality modeling conducted using California Emissions Estimator Model (CalEEMod), such as the amount of square footage of buildings displaced by the project (modeled by Ascent Environmental in 2016). This evaluation provides qualitative information and analysis, to the extent feasible. Many of the impacts discussed below address effects that would be related to construction and operation of mixed-use development, including replacement housing, which are described at a program level as detailed information is not available at this time. As applications for the mixed-use development sites are submitted to the City, additional project-level evaluation would be required, including the necessary documentation under CEQA, NEPA, and TRPA regulations. Impacts on utilities and service systems would be limited to portions of the study area within California; because no changes to population levels would result in Nevada, there would be no impacts on public services and utilities for the Nevada portion of the study area.  SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA NEPA Criteria An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the environmental effects that would be caused by, or result from, the locally preferred action. Under NEPA, the significance of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are encompassed by the TRPA and CEQA criteria used for this analysis. TRPA Criteria The “Public Services” and “Utilities” criteria from the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist (IEC) were used to evaluate the public services and utilities impacts of the build alternatives. The purpose of the TRPA IEC is primarily to determine if an EIS is required and to help define the topics to be evaluated in greater detail. While many of the IEC checklist questions are conducive for use as significance criteria (that is, they include a defined standard, qualitative or quantitative), many are not, such as some of those for public services and utilities. The project would result in a significant impact on public services and utilities if it would:  result in an unplanned effect on, or result in a need to alter, fire or law enforcement protection services;  result in a need for new systems, or substantial alterations to existing systems, for power or natural gas, communication systems, stormwater drainage, or solid waste;  utilize additional water that would exceed the maximum permitted capacity of the service provider; or  utilize additional sewage treatment capacity that would exceed the maximum permitted capacity of the sewage treatment provider. CEQA Criteria Based on Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines, impacts on public services and utilities would be significant if the project would:  result in substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of or need for new or physically altered governmental facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times, or other performance objectives for fire and law enforcement protection;   create a water supply demand in excess of existing entitlements and resources;  result in the determination by the wastewater treatment provider that serves or may serve the project that it does not have adequate capacity to serve the project’s projected demand in addition to the provider’s existing commitments;  exceed wastewater treatment requirements of the applicable regional water quality control board;  require or result in the construction of new water or wastewater treatment facilities or expansion of existing facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental effects;  be served by a landfill with insufficient permitted capacity to accommodate the project’s solid waste disposal needs; or  not comply with federal, state, and local statues and regulations related to solid waste. ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF THE PROJECT ALTERNATIVES Impact 3.5-1: Conflicts with existing utility infrastructure Transportation improvements and construction of mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for Alternatives B, C, and D could result in conflicts with existing utility infrastructure and require relocation of utilities or access points to utility infrastructure (i.e., water, sewer, electrical, and natural gas services). Depending on the alternative, utility infrastructure that could be affected by the build alternatives is generally located at and around the existing US 50/Pioneer Trail and Pioneer Trail/Echo Road intersections and along existing US 50, Fern Road, Moss Road, Montreal Road, and the lake side of Lake Parkway. TTD would be required to coordinate with utility providers to address the project’s conflicts with utility infrastructure. However, the extent to which existing utility infrastructure could be adversely affected, and plans for relocation, have not yet been determined, and plans for any necessary relocation have not yet been determined.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: Mitigation Measure 3.5-1 has been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, D, and E to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to conflicts with existing utility infrastructure; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, D, and E after implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.5-1; No Impact for Alternative A The study area contains utility infrastructure for multiple utility providers in California and Nevada. Utility providers within the California portion of the study area include STPUD (water and wastewater), Lakeside Park Association (water), and Liberty Utilities (electricity). Utility providers within the Nevada portion of the study area include DCSID (wastewater), EWC (water), and NV Energy (electricity). Southwest Gas has natural gas infrastructure in both California and Nevada.  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) With Alternative A, there would be no changes to existing utility lines associated with the project. Thus, there would be no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Utility infrastructure that is located in the project site is related to water, sewer, electricity, natural gas, and communications. Alternative B would include the need to cap off and abandon underground utility lines, including for water, sewer, and natural gas, that serve parcels that would be acquired for the project. These parcels are along portions of Moss Road, Montreal Road, Echo Road, and Lake Parkway.  The realigned US 50 would not follow existing roadway alignments through the Rocky Point neighborhood west of the Heavenly Village Center and would involve construction of a new US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection, widening of existing roads, and displacement of existing residential, commercial, and hotel/motel buildings. These activities would interfere with operation of STPUD infrastructure, including water and sewer lines, sewer manholes, and hydrants shown in Exhibit 3.5-1. For Alternative B transportation improvements, relocation of utility infrastructure could occur at and around the existing US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection and along Moss Road, Montreal Road, and the lake side of Lake Parkway (Cotulla et al., pers. comm., 2016). STPUD has expressed concern about maintaining access to district facilities within the study area. As the project goes through further design refinements, TTD would continue coordination with STPUD to address relocation and reconstruction of specific water and sewer infrastructure within the study area and to ensure that access to district facilities is maintained. Alternative B transportation improvements, including the new US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection, realigned US 50 through the Rocky Point neighborhood west of the Heavenly Village Center, new US 50/Heavenly Village Way intersection, and widening of the existing Montreal Road and Lake Parkway approximately 150 feet northeast of the existing Heavenly Village Way/Lake Parkway intersection, would interfere with operation of Liberty Utility electricity infrastructure. Liberty Utilities has indicated that the project would require realignment of electrical transmission facilities within the study area (Perra, pers. comm., 2016), including the existing 60 kV transmission lines that are located near the existing Montreal Road/Echo Road, the existing Montreal Road/Fern Road intersection, along Pioneer Trail between Echo Road and Primrose Road, and along the mountain side of Montreal Road between Echo Road and approximately 150 feet northeast of the Heavenly Village Way/Lake Parkway intersection.  Natural gas lines serving parcels that would be acquired for the project in the Rocky Point neighborhood west of Heavenly Village Center would need to be capped and abandoned. For Alternative B transportation improvements, relocation of natural gas infrastructure could occur at and around the existing US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection and along existing US 50, Moss Road, Montreal Road, and the lake side of Lake Parkway. As the project goes through further design refinements, TTD would coordinate with Southwest Gas to identify any gas lines that would need to be capped and abandoned within this neighborhood. The transportation improvements and new sidewalk on the lake side of US 50 between Lake Parkway and State Route (SR) 207 would interfere with operation of NV Energy infrastructure. Specifically, overhead electricity lines and associated poles would need to be relocated beyond the edge of the new sidewalk and placed underground. As the project goes through further design refinements, TTD would coordinate with NV Energy to relocate this infrastructure. Alternative B would not interfere with operation of utilities located beyond the edge of the existing sidewalk on the lake side of US 50 northeast of the US 50/Lake Parkway intersection. Other water, wastewater, and natural gas utility infrastructure in the Nevada portion of the study area are anticipated to remain in place, but could require some modifications to maintain access. TTD would be required to coordinate with DCSID, EWC, and Southwest Gas to address potential interference with access to their utility lines in the Nevada portion of the study area. TTD would be required to coordinate relocation of affected utility infrastructure with utility providers prior to construction; however, the extent to which the existing utility infrastructure could be adversely affected, and plans for relocation, have not yet been determined. Thus, this impact would be potentially significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible conflicts with utility infrastructure.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Impacts of Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, related to interference with existing utility lines would be similar to those described above, including relocation of overhead electricity lines and access to water, sewer, and natural gas infrastructure.  With regard to mixed-use development Site 2, STPUD has expressed concern related to water lines and sewer gravity lines along Echo Road and Fern Road that extend through this site (Cotulla et al., pers. comm., 2016). The sewer gravity lines connect to a sewer main located in existing US 50. The conceptual plan for mixed-use development does not identify the locations where buildings would be placed on this site; thus, because the STPUD lines are in place under an encroachment permit, access to these lines could be eliminated. Eliminating access at this point in the water and sewer infrastructure system would require STPUD to install additional infrastructure to convey water and sewer flows around this site. Because mixed-use development, including replacement housing, on Site 2 could conflict with STPUD water and wastewater infrastructure at this location, this would be a potentially significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into construction of the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to conflicts with utility infrastructure. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for conflicts with utility infrastructure as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential impacts related to conflicts with utility infrastructure would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would result in a potentially significant impact from the potential for exposure of construction personnel and the public to recognized environmental conditions or previously undocumented contamination. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into construction of the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to conflicts with utility infrastructure. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Impacts related to interference with existing utility lines would be similar to those described above for Alternative B transportation improvements. For these reasons, implementation of Alternative C transportation improvements would result in a potentially significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible conflicts with utility infrastructure.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Impacts related to interference with existing utility lines would be similar to those described above for Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing. For these reasons, implementation of Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a potentially significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into construction of the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to conflicts with utility infrastructure. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for conflicts with utility infrastructure as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential conflicts with utility infrastructure would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would result in a potentially significant impact from the potential for conflicts with utility infrastructure. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into construction of the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to conflicts with utility infrastructure. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2  Transportation Improvements Impacts related to interference with existing utility lines would be similar to those described above for Alternative B transportation improvements. The US 50 realignment for Alternative D would be shifted north compared to Alternative B, with a resulting shift in utility interference from a portion of Moss Road (with Alternative B) to portions of Echo Road and Fern Road (with Alternative D). For Alternative D transportation improvements, relocation of utility infrastructure could occur at and around the existing US 50/Pioneer Trail and Pioneer Trail/Echo Road intersections and along US 50, Fern Road, Montreal Road, and the lake side of Lake Parkway. In spite of this shift in the locations of utility interference, the impacts of Alternative D on utilities would be similar in nature to those described for Alternative B transportation improvements. For these reasons, implementation of Alternative D transportation improvements would result in a potentially significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative D to further reduce to the extent feasible conflicts with utility infrastructure. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. Impacts related to interference with existing utility lines would be similar to those described above for Alternative B with mixed-use development. Construction of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, on Sites 1B and 2 for Alternative D would result in interference with access to STPUD water and sewer lines along Echo Road and Fern Road, as described above for Alternative B with mixed-use development. For these reasons, implementation of Alternative D with mixed-use development would result in a potentially significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into construction of the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to conflicts with utility infrastructure. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for conflicts with utility infrastructure as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential conflicts with utility infrastructure would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would result in a potentially significant impact from the potential for conflicts with utility infrastructure. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into construction of the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to conflicts with utility infrastructure. Alternative E: Skywalk Impacts related to interference with existing utility lines would be limited to the portion of the project study area within the Tourist Core that extends through the resort casinos. TTD has not yet determined the extent to which the existing utility infrastructure could be adversely affected, and plans for relocation have not yet been determined. However, it is anticipated that some relocation of underground utilities would be required as a result of placement of underground piles to support the raised pedestrian walkway structure. As discussed above for Alternative B transportation improvements, TTD would be required to coordinate with utility providers to address the project’s conflicts with utility infrastructure. However, the extent to which the existing utility infrastructure could be adversely affected by Alternative E and plans for relocation have not yet been determined. For these reasons, this impact would be potentially significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative E to further reduce to the extent feasible conflicts with utility infrastructure.  Impact 3.5-2: Increased demand for water supply  Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would generate water demand for dust suppression during construction that would be met by water trucks as necessary. Implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would require water supplies for operation of residential and commercial uses and for fire suppression. Water demand associated with the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would require additional water supplies; however, projected demand under each alternative would be substantially less than available supplies. Alternative E would generate water demand for dust suppression during construction, which would be met by water trucks as necessary.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize water demand environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; No Impact for Alternative A Alternative A: No Build (No Project) With Alternative A, there would be no project activity and no changes to water supply. There would be no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Alternative B would include construction of the US 50 realignment, intersection improvements, pedestrian overcrossing into Van Sickle Bi-State Park, and pedestrian and bicyclist enhancements. Water would be required during the construction period for dust abatement and fire suppression. Water for dust abatement would be provided by water trucks. Water for fire suppression would be provided by existing hydrants in the study area. During construction activities, a certain number of fire hydrants would have to remain operational at all times, which would be specified in the project’s construction documents. Existing fire hydrants in the Rocky Point neighborhood would be relocated during project construction to coincide with the new alignment. Fire hydrants along the mountain side of Lake Parkway also have the potential to be relocated as part of the project. Implementation of Alternative B without mixed-used development would result in a reduction in water demand during operation because residential, hotel/motel, and commercial uses would be removed and water demand associated with dust abatement would be temporary. Existing water demand associated with these displaced uses is 25,000 gpd (28 afy; see Table 3.5-3). This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the effects related to water demand such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.   Table 3.5-3 Existing Uses and Proposed Uses Water Demand Comparison  Alternative  Existing Water Demand for Displaced Uses1 (gpd/afy)  New Water Demand (gpd/afy)  Change in Water Demand  (+ = increase/- = decrease; gpd/afy)  Transportation Improvements        B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action)  25,000 (28)  0  -25,000 (-28)  C: Triangle One-Way  24,000 (27)  0  -24,000 (-27)  D: PSR Alternative 2  29,000 (32)  0  -29,000 (-32)  With Mixed-Use Development        B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action)  24,100 (27)  117,550 (132)  93,450 (105)  C: Triangle One-Way  24,100 (27)  117,550 (132)  93,450 (105)  D: PSR Alternative 2  8,400 (9)  119,680 (134)  111,280 (125)  1 The numbers of displaced multi-family residential, single-family residential, TAUs, and CFA are identified in Tables 2-2 and 2-4 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives.” Multi-family residential, single-family residential, and TAU water demand factor = 200 gpd/unit. CFA water demand factor = 1.56 gpd/sq. ft. The existing water demand from TAUs is calculated using the average hotel occupancy rate in the City of South Lake Tahoe, which is 43 percent (TTD 2013:14).  Source: Compiled by Ascent Environmental, Inc. in 2016  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. Construction of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would include water demand related to dust abatement and fire suppression. These demands are anticipated to be met through existing water supplies in the study area or by water trucks, as with construction of the project roadway improvements. Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, and the transportation improvements would result in displacement of 88 housing units and 14 businesses, including hotel/motels, which would be replaced with up to 229 new housing units and 46,250 square feet of commercial floor area (CFA). Water demand generated by the mixed-use development is shown in Table 3.5-4. Operation of the residential and commercial uses in the mixed-use development would be anticipated to generate water demand equal to 117,550 gpd (132 afy). After displacement of residences, hotel/motels, and commercial units, this would be a net increase in water demand at the mixed-use development sites of 68,450 gpd (77 afy) after taking into account uses displaced by the mixed-use development and the right-of-way needs for the transportation improvements (see Table 3.5-3). This net increase in water demand represents less than 2 percent of the projected water supply and demand shown in Table 3.5-1 above.  As described above, STPUD would pump sufficient supply to meet the demands during each of the single and multiple dry year scenarios, without requiring a reduction in demand or supplemental supplies. Projected water demand within the STPUD service area (see Table 3.5-1) is well within the estimated safe pumping yield of 9,528 afy in the groundwater basin. Because the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would be subject to density limitations in the Regional Plan and TCAP and would utilize commodity allocations for residential and CFA, it is reasonable to assume that the potential net increase in water demand in the project site resulting from the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, is within the growth assumptions used for determining future water demand in STPUD’s UWMP. Furthermore, STPUD has indicated that sufficient water supply and infrastructure are available to meet the demands of the mixed-use development (Coolidge and Goligoski, pers. comm., 2016). It is important to note that water demand would likely be lower than reported in Table 3.5-4, as new buildings would be equipped with more efficient toilets, water heaters, and other types of residential water uses.  Table 3.5-4 Mixed-Use Development, including Replacement Housing, Estimated Water Demand  Alternative  Multi-Family Residential Units   Commercial Floor Area  (square feet)  Multi-Family Residential Water Demand Factor (gpd/unit)  Commercial Water Demand Factor (gpd/square foot)  Total Multi-Family Residential Water Demand  (gpd/afy)  Total Commercial Water Demand (gpd/afy)  Total Water Demand  (gpd/afy)  A: No Build (No Project)  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action)/ C: Triangle One-Way1  227  46,250  200  1.56  45,400 (51)  72,150 (81)  117,550 (132)  D: PSR Alternative 2  224  48,000  200  1.56  44,800 (50)  74,880 (84)  119,680 (134)  E: Skywalk  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  Notes: NA = not applicable 1 Because Alternatives B and C propose the same amount of mixed-use development, they would result in the same water demand and are shown together. Source: Coolidge, pers. comm., 2016a  TRPA Code Section 32.4 does not allow project approval unless adequate quantity and quality of water for domestic consumption and fire protection are available, which would be demonstrated through the acquisition of a “will serve” letter from the applicable water purveyor, in this case STPUD for the mixed-use development. Because sufficient water supplies and water supply infrastructure, for residential and commercial use and fire flow, are available to meet demand associated with the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development including replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize the effects related to water demand such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar increase in water demand as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential effects related to water demand would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development including replacement housing would result in a less-than-significant impact on water demand. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would minimize effects related to water demand such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Alternative C transportation improvements would be similar to Alternative B, except that the project footprint would be reduced. Water requirements for construction would be similar to those described above, including for fire suppression during construction activities and with implementation of the project. Alternative C would displace fewer total housing units than Alternative B (see Table 2-2 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). Existing water demand associated with these displaced housing units, CFA, and TAUs is 24,000 gpd (27 afy; see Table 3.5-3). Because water demand during construction would be minimal, short term, and likely supplied by water trucks from available sources, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the effects related to water demand such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, and the transportation improvements would result in displacement of 83 housing units and 14 businesses, including hotel/motels, which would be replaced with up to 229 new housing units and 46,250 square feet of CFA. Operation of the residential and commercial uses in the mixed-use development would generate the same water demand described above for Alternative B with mixed-use development. After displacement of residences, hotel/motels, and commercial units, this would be a net increase in water demand at the mixed-use development sites of 69,450 gpd (78 afy) after taking into account uses displaced by the mixed-use development and the right-of-way needs for the transportation improvements (see Table 3.5-3). This net increase in water demand represents less than 2 percent of the projected water supply and demand shown in Table 3.5-1. Because sufficient water supplies and water supply infrastructure are available, as described above for Alternative B with mixed-use development, to meet the water demand from Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development including replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would avoid or minimize the effects related to water demand such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar increase in water demand as described for the mixed-use development sites.

Water requirements for construction would be similar to those described above for Alternative B, including for fire suppression during construction activities and with implementation of the project. Alternative D would displace fewer housing units than Alternatives B and C (see Table 2-2 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). However, Alternative D transportation improvements would result in displacing a greater number of businesses compared to Alternatives B and C. Existing water demand associated with these displaced housing units, CFA, and TAUs is 29,000 gpd (32 afy; see Table 3.5-3). Because water demand for construction would be minimal, short term, and likely supplied by water trucks from available sources, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the effects related to water demand such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, and the transportation improvements would result in displacement of 78 housing units and 10 businesses, including hotel/motels, which would be replaced with up to 224 new housing units and 48,000 square feet of CFA. Operation of the residential and commercial uses in the mixed-use development would generate water demand equal to 119,680 gpd (see Table 3.5-3). After displacement of residences, hotel/motels, and commercial units, this would be a net increase in water demand at the project site of 82,280 gpd (92 afy) after taking into account uses displaced by the mixed-use development and the right-of-way needs for the transportation improvements (see Table 3.5-3). This net increase in water demand represents less than 2 percent of the projected water supply and demand shown in Table 3.5-1. Because sufficient water supplies and water supply infrastructure are available to meet the water demand from Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as described above for Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development including replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would avoid or minimize the effects related to water demand such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar increase in water demand as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential effects related to water demand would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development including replacement housing would result in a less-than-significant impact on water demand. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would minimize effects related to water demand such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative E: Skywalk With Alternative E, water requirements for construction would be similar to those described above for Alternative B transportation improvements including for fire suppression during construction activities and with implementation of this alternative. Because water demand would be minimal, short term, and likely supplied by water trucks from available sources, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative E would avoid or minimize the effects related to water demand such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Impact 3.5-3: Increased demand for wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment  Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements and Alternative E would not result in an increased demand on wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment because construction workers would use portable toilets rather than public wastewater facilities.  Construction of mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for Alternatives B, C, and D would require additional wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment to serve the additional residential and commercial development. Adequate capacity is available in the wastewater treatment plant to serve the wastewater flows generated by the mixed-use development, including replacement housing. However, the addition of wastewater flows from the mixed-use development would exceed the capacity of one segment of pipe in the wastewater collection and conveyance system near the McDonald’s on Lake Tahoe Boulevard and contribute flows to another segment of pipe on Lakeshore Boulevard south of Park Avenue that is already over capacity.  Because no project activity would be implemented with Alternative A, there would be no change in demand for wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment. NEPA Environmental Consequences: Mitigation Measure 3.5-3 has been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to demand for wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment; No Impact for Alternatives A and E CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, and D after implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.5-3; Less Than Significant for Alternative E; No Impact for Alternative A Alternative A: No Build (No Project) With Alternative A, the project would not be implemented. Thus, there would be no impact on demand for wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements With Alternative B transportation improvements, construction workers would be served by portable toilets. There would be no increase in wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment needed to implement this scenario. There would be no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. Alternative B with mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in displacement of 88 housing units and construction of up to 227 new housing units. Wastewater flows generated by the mixed-use development are shown in Table 3.5-5. Operation of the residential and commercial uses in the mixed-use development would generate wastewater flows equal to 99,935 gpd. After displacement of residences, hotel/motels, and commercial units for the mixed-use development and the right-of-way needs for the roadway improvements, Alternative B would result in an estimated net increase in wastewater generated at the project site of approximately 60,920 gpd (see Table 3.5-6).  Table 3.5-5 Mixed-Use Development Estimated Wastewater Flows  Alternative  Multi-Family Residential Units   Commercial Floor Area  (square feet)  Multi-Family Residential Wastewater Demand Factor (gpd/unit)   Commercial Wastewater Demand Factor (gpd/square feet)   Total Multi-Family Residential Wastewater Flows (gpd)  Total Commercial Wastewater Flows (gpd)  Total Wastewater Flows (gpd)  A: No Build (No Project)  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action)/ C: Triangle One-Way1  227  46,250  155  1.40  35,185  64,750  99,935  D: PSR Alternative 2  224  48,000  155  1.40  34,720  67,200  101,920  E: Skywalk  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA = not applicable 1 Because Alternatives B and C propose the same amount of mixed-use development they would result in the same wastewater flows and are shown together here. Source: Coolidge, pers. comm., 2016a   As described above, the STPUD WWTP has 3.7 mgd of available treatment capacity to meet future demand. The net increase in wastewater flow from Alternative B with mixed-use development, including replacement housing, represents less than 2 percent of the available WWTP capacity. Sufficient wastewater treatment capacity is available to meet the demands of Alternative B with mixed-use development. The mixed-use development sites are located in areas that are currently served by wastewater collection infrastructure. Construction of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would be able to connect to this existing infrastructure. STPUD has indicated that the wastewater infrastructure in the Rocky Point neighborhood west of Heavenly Village Center is operating well (Cotulla et al., pers. comm., 2016). Preliminary modeling results provided by STPUD for the increase in wastewater flows from the project indicate that the existing sewer system has available capacity to serve the project, with the exception of a 105-foot long section of pipe in the parking lot of McDonald’s on Lake Tahoe Boulevard southwest of Wildwood Avenue, between sanitary sewer manhole (SSMH) BJ182 and SSMH BJ181 (Coolidge and Goligoski, pers. comm., 2016:3 – 4). The modeling indicates that with the addition of flows from the project, this section of pipe would surcharge. (Note: surcharging is an indicator of a potential sanitary sewer overflow condition.) Additionally, mixed-use development at Site 3 would contribute wastewater flows to an existing surcharge condition in SSMH BJ25 near Lakeshore Boulevard and Park Avenue. Table 3.5-6 Existing Uses and Proposed Uses Wastewater Demand Comparison  Alternative  Existing Wastewater Flows for Displaced Parcels1 (gpd)  New Wastewater Flows (gpd)  Change in Wastewater Flows (+ = increase/- = decrease; gpd)  Transportation Improvements  B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action)   11,780  0  -11,780  C: Triangle One-Way  11,005  0  -11,005  D: PSR Alternative 2  21,202  0  -21,002  With Mixed-Use Development  B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action)   18,234  99,935  60,921  C: Triangle One-Way  18,234  99,935  70,696  D: PSR Alternative 2  7,262  101,920  73,456  1 Wastewater demand for existing uses was determined based on the estimated amount of commercial floor area (CFA) and housing units displaced by the alternatives. These estimates do not take into account the change in use of water from existing TAUs that would be displaced in order to be consistent with analysis conducted by STPUD; therefore, the estimated net change in wastewater flows are conservative.

Because capacity of the wastewater collection/conveyance infrastructure in one section of sewer pipe would be exceeded with the addition of wastewater flows from Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, and would contribute wastewater flows to an existing surcharge condition in another section of sewer pipe this impact would be potentially significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the construction of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to demand for wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar demand for wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential wastewater impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a potentially significant impact on wastewater demand. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to demand for wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements With Alternative C transportation improvements, construction workers would be served by portable toilets.

After displacement of residences, hotel/motels, and commercial units for the mixed-use development and the right-of-way needs for the roadway improvements, Alternative C would result in an estimated net increase in wastewater generated at the mixed-use development sites of approximately 70,700 gpd (see Table 3.5-6). The net increase in wastewater flow from Alternative C represents less than 2 percent of the available WWTP capacity.

During operation, the residential and commercial uses in the mixed-use development would generate wastewater flows equal to 101,920 gpd. After displacement of residences, hotel/motels, and commercial units for the mixed-use development and the right-of-way needs for the roadway improvements, Alternative D would result in an estimated net increase in wastewater generated at the mixed-use development sites of approximately 73,460 gpd (see Table 3.5-6). The net increase in wastewater flow from Alternative D represents less than 2 percent of the available wastewater treatment plant capacity.

There would be no increase in wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment needed to implement this scenario. There would be no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Impact 3.5-4: Increased generation of solid waste  Under the build alternatives, waste generated during land clearing, grubbing, scraping, excavation, land leveling, grading, cut and fill, and demolition activities would require disposal. Under Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, scenarios, solid waste generation would increase over the long term as a result of new housing units and commercial units. However, the Lockwood Regional Landfill presently has a capacity of approximately 280 million cubic yards. Waste generated as part of the project would not represent a substantial proportion of remaining capacity at the landfill. Additionally, Alternatives B, C, D, and E would implement a Construction Waste Management Plan and divert a minimum of 65 percent of construction and demolition waste from the landfill.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize solid waste demand environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; No Impact for Alternative A Alternative A: No Build (No Project) With Alternative A, the project would not be constructed. Thus, there would be no increase in population that could result in changes to solid waste generation. There would be no impact for purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Implementation of Alternative B transportation improvements would require land clearing, grubbing, scraping, excavation, land leveling, grading, cut and fill, and demolition activities. These activities are anticipated to generate approximately 5,700 cubic yards of solid waste, based on preliminary analysis (modeled by Ascent Environmental in 2016). Waste from demolition and site preparation activities would be hauled to and disposed of at Lockwood Regional Landfill in Storey County, Nevada, which has approximately 280 million cubic yards of available capacity (NDEP 2016). However, in accordance with Section 5.408 of the CALGreen Code, the project would submit and complete a Construction Waste Management Plan to the City of South Lake Tahoe and would recycle and/or salvage for reuse a minimum of 65 percent of construction and demolition (C&D) debris generated during project construction. Because adequate capacity is available to serve Alternative B transportation improvements and activities would be carried out in compliance with regulations pertaining to solid waste disposal and diversion of C&D waste, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to solid waste disposal and C&D diversion such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements.  As described above, Alternative B transportation improvements would generate 5,700 cubic yards of solid waste during construction and demolition of the roadway alignment. The addition of mixed-use development would result in construction of up to 46,250 square feet of commercial space and 227 housing units, for a net increase of 139 housing units. As discussed in Section 3.4, “Community Impacts,” on average this additional development would generate approximately 186 new jobs and a net increase of 317 residents. The net increase in waste generated by the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for each alternative is shown in Table 3.5-7. Given assumptions made in the Regional Plan Update EIS (see “Methods and Assumptions” above), Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would generate approximately 440 tons of waste per year from new residents and approximately 350 tons of waste per year from new jobs, for a total of approximately 790 tons (1,060 cubic yards) of waste per year. It is important to note that the amount of solid waste generated by Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, is substantially overestimated because the assumptions do not account for diversion of recyclable materials or waste reduction requirements, and assumes that retail uses would be placed in all new commercial units. This alternative would result in a small increase in solid waste generated (0.0004 percent) per year of the remaining approximately 280 million cubic yards of space available at Lockwood Regional Landfill. Additionally, prior to issuance of building permits, the mixed-use development proponents would be required to prepare and implement a Construction Waste Management Plan, which would result in diverting a minimum of 65 percent of C&D waste from the landfill. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Table 3.5-7 Estimated Solid Waste Generated by Mixed-Use Development  Alternative  Net Increase in Residents  Net Increase in Employees  Total Residential Waste1 (tons/year)  Total Commercial Waste1 (tons/year)  Total Waste (tons/year)  Total Waste (cubic yard/year)  A: No Build  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action)  317  186  441  353  794  1,059  C: Triangle One-Way  328  186  456  353  809  1,079  D: PSR Alternative 2  333  210  463  339  862  1,149  E: Skywalk  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  1 The solid waste generation factors used in the analysis of total solid waste generated are 1.39 tons per resident per year and 1.9 tons per employee per year. NA = not applicable  Source: TRPA 2012a:3.13-10; CalRecycle 2016; compiled by Ascent Environmental in 2016   For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to solid waste disposal such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar demand for solid waste disposal and C&D diversion as described for the mixed-use development sites.

Waste from demolition and site preparation activities could be hauled to and disposed of at Lockwood Regional Landfill in Storey County, Nevada, which has approximately 280 million cubic yards of available capacity (NDEP 2016). However, some materials would be reused or recycled, including wood, concrete, and other types of masonry and drywall. While the amount of material diverted is unknown at this time, it is reasonable to assume that reuse and recycling of materials would occur to the extent feasible.

This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to solid waste disposal such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar demand for solid waste disposal and C&D diversion as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential solid waste impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on solid waste disposal. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative D would minimize the solid waste environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative E: Skywalk Implementation of Alternative E would require land clearing, grubbing, scraping, excavation, land leveling, grading, cut and fill, and demolition activities. The disturbance area for construction of Alternative E is smaller than that for Alternative B, and implementation of Alternative E would not involve the displacement of residential, hotel/motel, and commercial buildings that would occur with Alternative B. For these reasons, construction activities for Alternative E are anticipated to generate less solid waste than Alternative B. Wastes from demolition and site preparation activities could be hauled to and disposed of at Lockwood Regional Landfill, which has approximately 280 million cubic yards of available capacity (NDEP 2016). As described above for Alternative B, Alternative E would implement a Construction Waste Management Plan and divert a minimum of 65 percent of C&D waste from the landfill. Because adequate capacity is available to serve Alternative E and activities would be carried out in compliance with regulations pertaining to solid waste disposal, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative E would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to solid waste disposal and C&D diversion such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Impact 3.5-5: Inefficient and wasteful consumption of energy The energy used for project construction would not require substantial additional power generation capacity or substantially increase peak or base-period demand for electricity and other forms of energy. New housing units associated with Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would be required to meet Title 24 standards for energy efficiency. The mixed-use development sites would be concentrated within walking distance of retail, restaurants, and services. In addition, vehicle trips generated by the project would not be considered inefficient, wasteful, or unnecessary in comparison to other similar developments in the Region.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to inefficient or wasteful consumption of energy; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; No Impact for Alternative A Alternative A: No Build (No Project) With Alternative A, the project would not be constructed. Thus, there would be no increase in population that could result in changes to energy consumption. There would be no impact for purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Energy would be required to construct project elements, operate and maintain construction equipment, and produce and transport construction materials. The one-time energy expenditure required to construct the physical infrastructure associated with Alternative B transportation improvements would be non-recoverable. Most energy consumption would result from operation of construction equipment, and actual indirect energy consumption (e.g., waste transport and disposal) may vary from the modeled values, depending on the final design of individual structures. The energy used for project construction would not require substantial additional capacity or substantially increase peak or base-period demand for electricity and other forms of energy. The project has no unusual characteristics that would necessitate the use of construction equipment that would be less energy efficient than typical equipment used at comparable construction sites in other parts of the state. Non-renewable energy would not be consumed in a wasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary manner when compared to other construction sites in the Region. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to inefficient or wasteful consumption of energy such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements.  Alternative B mixed-used development, including replacement housing, would result in a net increase in the number of housing units within the study area and, therefore, an increase in the amount of electricity and natural gas needed. Project operation would be typical of residential and commercial uses, requiring electricity and natural gas for lighting, climate control, and day-to-day activities. Operational energy use would also include landscape maintenance, snow removal equipment, and groundwater well operation. Indirect energy use would include wastewater treatment and solid waste removal. Electricity and natural gas supplies, from Liberty Energy and Southwest Gas Corporation, would be available to serve the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, proposed for Alternative B (Perra, pers. comm., 2016; Echeverria, pers. comm., 2016).  The project would be required to meet Title 24 standards for energy efficiency. Identified housing and commercial areas would be concentrated within walking distance of retail, restaurants, and services. The demolition and replacement of housing within the study area would provide an opportunity to update outdated infrastructure and improve energy-efficiency of buildings. Fuel consumption associated with vehicle trips generated by the project would not be considered inefficient, wasteful, or unnecessary in comparison to other similar developments in the Region. The project is located near public transportation and in an urban area, consistent with sustainable community design practices. As discussed further in Impact 3.14-1 in Section 3.14, “Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change,” the project would meet the GHG efficiency standard established in the 2020 statewide GHG emissions target.  Appendix F of the State CEQA Guidelines requires consideration of the potentially significant energy implications of a project. CEQA requires mitigation measures to reduce “wasteful, inefficient, and unnecessary” energy usage (Public Resources Code Section 21100[b][3]). While the project would increase the overall energy demand in the study area, new construction would provide an opportunity to decrease per capita energy usage compared to the existing housing through design considerations. In addition, due to the location of the project near an urban center, mixed-use development would be consistent with sustainable community design practices, which are generally intended to reduce GHG emissions associated with fuel consumption. Thus, Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not result in an inefficient or wasteful consumption of energy. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to inefficient or wasteful consumption of energy such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for inefficient or wasteful consumption of energy as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential impacts related to inefficient or wasteful consumption of energy would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on inefficient or wasteful consumption of energy. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative B would minimize the environmental consequences of inefficient or wasteful consumption of energy such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Energy use with Alternative C transportation improvements would be the same as with Alternative B. For the reasons discussed above for Alternative B, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to inefficient or wasteful consumption of energy such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. Energy use for Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would be the same as for Alternative B. For the reasons discussed above for Alternative B, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to inefficient or wasteful consumption of energy such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential for inefficient or wasteful consumption of energy as described for the mixed-use development sites.

For the reasons discussed above for Alternative B, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to inefficient or wasteful consumption of energy such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

For the reasons discussed above for Alternative B, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative E would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to inefficient or wasteful consumption of energy such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Impact 3.5-6: Increased demand for law enforcement and fire and emergency services Multiple local, state, and federal agencies provide police, fire, and emergency services to the study area throughout high and low tourist seasons. Because Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would not result in an increased population, there would be no increase in demand for police, fire, or emergency services. With Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, population increases would not be substantial enough to require additional police, fire, or emergency services. Demand for law enforcement, fire, and emergency services would not increase with Alternatives A and E.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, and D would avoid or minimize environmental consequences related to demand for law enforcement, fire, and emergency services such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; No Impact for Alternatives A and E CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, and D; No Impact for Alternatives A and E  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) With Alternative A, the project would not be constructed. Thus, there would be no increase in population that could result an increased demand for law enforcement or fire and emergency services. There would be no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements The study area is located in a tourist destination, marked by a variety of active recreational opportunities, including boating, hiking, cycling, skiing, and passive forms of recreation. Multiple local, state, and federal agencies provide police, fire, and emergency services to the study area throughout high and low tourist seasons. Areas within the study area are currently developed and are served by the South Lake Tahoe Police Department, SLTFD, and TDFPD. Without construction of new mixed-use development, including replacement housing, the permanent population within the study area would decrease with demolition of housing units; however, fluctuations in population related to tourism would not be altered by the project and would continue to occur on a seasonal basis. Furthermore, displaced residents are expected to relocate within the City of South Lake Tahoe (see discussion under “Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing” below), thus, the population levels served by law enforcement and fire and emergency services would not substantially change. Because Alternative B transportation improvements would not result in an increase in the population, there would be no increase in demand for police, fire, or emergency services and, therefore, no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements.  Construction of mixed-use development, including replacement housing, with Alternative B would result in the construction of up to 212 residential units and removal of 92 housing units. While the City of South Lake Tahoe is not subject to a performance standard regarding law enforcement levels (City of South Lake Tahoe 2010:4.11-12), the ratio of sworn officers to housing units is approximately 1:419 (37 sworn officer:15,500 residential units). Given a net increase of up to 139 housing units, new facilities to support additional law enforcement needs would not be required. Likewise, the SLTFD does not have a standard ratio goal for fire and emergency services. Population increases associated with 139 housing units would not be substantial compared to the more than 15,500 housing units currently served. Regardless, Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would be required to analyze the effects related to fire protection, law enforcement, and emergency response services, including consultation with these service providers. This impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for Alternative B would avoid or minimize the effects related to demand for fire protection, law enforcement, and emergency response services such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar demand for fire protection, law enforcement, and emergency response services as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential effects related to increased demand for fire protection, law enforcement, and emergency services would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on demand for fire protection, law enforcement, and emergency response services. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative B would minimize the effects related to demand for fire protection, law enforcement, and emergency response services such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Because Alternative C transportation improvements would not result in an increase in the population, there would be no increase in demand for police, fire, or emergency services.

For the reasons described above for Alternative B, there would be no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Likewise, the SLTFD does not have a standard ratio goal for fire and emergency services. Population increases associated with 146 housing units would not be substantial compared to the more than 15,500 housing units currently served.

No residents would be displaced with Alternative E and no new residences would be constructed. For these reasons, Alternative E would not result in an increase in the population or associated demand for police, fire, or emergency services. Furthermore, Alternative E would not require additional personnel or construction of new facilities associated with police, fire, or emergency services. For these reasons, there would be no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Impact 3.5-7: Increased demand for public schools  Implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would result in a decrease in population due to the removal of housing units. This is likely to reduce the number of students in the study area and would not require the construction of additional public schools. With Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, the number of additional students would be minimal compared to the total student population of the school district and typical fluctuation in enrollment at nearby public schools. Schools would not be affected with Alternative A and E.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, and D would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to demand for schools; No Impact for Alternatives A and E CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, and D; No Impact for Alternatives A and E Alternative A: No Build (No Project) With Alternative A, the project would not be constructed. Thus, there would be no increase in population that could result in additional enrollment at public schools. There would be no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements With Alternative B transportation improvements, population would decrease due to demolition of housing units. Thus, new schools would not be required and there would be no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. With Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, a net increase of 139 housing units could be constructed. Public schools in the project vicinity include Bijou Community School, South Tahoe Middle School, and South Tahoe High School (see Table 3.5-2 for a complete list of schools in the Lake Tahoe Unified School District). No specific data related to student generation rates exist for the South Lake Tahoe area; however, the El Dorado County estimated rate is 0.338 students per household. According to this rate, the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, could result in approximately 47 new students. This increase would not be substantial compared to the currently enrolled 3,881 students (2014/2015 school year); would not be substantial compared to the fluctuations in enrollment over the past 5 years (3,793 to 3,881 students); and would not exceed levels observed in the district in the past (Table 3.5-2). As described in Impact 3.4-3 and shown in Table 3.4-9, the small potential increase in permanent employment would be met by the existing local workforce and, thus, would not be expected to increase the population or result in an increase in demand for schools. Thus, no new school facilities would be required and this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to demand for schools such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar demand for schools as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential school demand impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative B would minimize the environmental consequences related to demand for schools such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements With Alternative C transportation improvements, population would decrease due to demolition of housing units.

Thus, new schools would not be required and there would be no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. With Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, a net increase of 146 housing units could be constructed. According to the El Dorado County estimated student generation rate, the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, could result in approximately 49 new students. This increase would not be substantial compared to the currently enrolled 3,881 students (2014/2015 school year); would not be substantial compared to the fluctuations in enrollment over the past 5 years (3,793 to 3,881 students); and would not exceed levels observed in the district in the past (Table 3.5-2). Thus, no new school facilities would be required and this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to demand for schools such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in a similar potential demand for schools as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential school demand impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative D would minimize the environmental consequences related to demand for schools such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alternative E: Skywalk Implementation of Alternative E would be limited to construction of a raised pedestrian walkway over US 50 through the resort-casino portion of the Tourist Core. No residents would be displaced by Alternative E and no new residences would be constructed. As described in Impact 3.4-3 and shown in Table 3.4-9, the small potential increase in permanent employment would be met by the existing local workforce and, thus, would not be expected to increase the population or result in an increase in demand for schools. Alternative E would not generate additional demand for school services, and no new school facilities would be required to be constructed. For these reasons, there would be no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  3.5.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures Mitigation Measure 3.5-1: Prepare and implement a Utility Relocation Plan This mitigation measure is required for Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, and Alternative E, for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Before the start of construction-related activities, including demolition of displaced residential, hotel/motel, and commercial buildings, the TTD (and the project proponent for the mixed-use development) shall coordinate with STPUD, DCSID, EWC, Lakeside Park Association, Liberty Utilities, NV Energy, and Southwest Gas Corporation to relocate utility infrastructure, which is dependent on the alternative and could include infrastructure at and near the existing US 50/Pioneer Trail and Pioneer Trail/Echo Road intersections and along US 50, Fern Road, Moss Road, Primrose Road, Montreal Road, and the lake side of Lake Parkway. The final design plans for the transportation improvements submitted to Caltrans and NDOT shall identify all utility relocations affected by the transportation improvements. To minimize disruption to utility services, relocation of the utility lines shall occur after any required clearing and demolition within the study area and before construction of the realigned US 50 and other transportation improvements. Actions needed to comply with this mitigation measure include coordination with each affected utility company to prepare a utility relocation plan that would, at a minimum, include the following:  plans that identify the utility infrastructure elements that require relocation as a result of constructing the project transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing;   safety measures to avoid any human health hazards or environmental hazards associated with capping and abandoning some utility infrastructure, such as natural gas lines or sewer lines;  timing for completion of the utility infrastructure relocation as part of construction of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, which shall be scheduled to minimize disruption to the utility companies and their customers;   reparations, if required, and certification of necessary additional environmental evaluations and pertinent processes (e.g., CEQA, NEPA, and/or TRPA documents and requirements), all of which shall be completed, as necessary, before final plans for the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, are permitted;   preparation and approval by a licensed civil engineer; and   approval as adequate by the affected utility companies and Caltrans, NDOT, TTD, and TRPA, as necessary.  Significance after Mitigation Implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.5-1 would reduce potentially significant impacts related to interference with utility infrastructure because TTD would coordinate with affected utility companies, engineering studies, and environmental analyses to ensure that all utility realignment and/or relocation plans are feasible and compliant with federal, state, and local regulations. Because the utility relocations would occur simultaneously with construction of the project and would be within the project disturbance area (i.e., the study area), the effects of the utility line relocations on the environment would be similar to, and not greater than, the environmental effects of the project, which are assessed throughout the resource sections in this document. Implementation of this measure would reduce impacts to a less-than-significant level for all build alternatives for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the environmental consequences related to interference with utility infrastructure from implementing the build alternatives with Mitigation Measure  3.5-1 would not be adverse. Mitigation Measure 3.5-3: Ensure sufficient capacity in the STPUD wastewater collection and conveyance system This mitigation measure is required for Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Prior to completion of project-level environmental review for the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, the project applicant shall coordinate with STPUD to determine the wastewater conveyance demand for a detailed project design, including the number of housing units and square footage of commercial floor area. If STPUD finds that the project-generated peak wastewater flows cause the STPUD line between SSMH BJ182 and SSMH BJ181 to surcharge, then STPUD and the project applicant shall develop plans for and construct improvements that would allow for conveyance of buildout wastewater flows. The project applicant shall be responsible for covering the cost of improvements that would be needed to serve the mixed-use development. The improvements shall be constructed to meet peak wet weather flows in the sewer line between SSMH BJ182 and SSMH BJ181, located near McDonald’s and Lake Tahoe Vacation Resort on Lake Tahoe Boulevard. The plans shall identify the timing of the improvements, and that the capacity of the line will be available when needed by the mixed-use development. Replacement of this sewer line shall be completed prior to occupancy of the mixed-use development.  If STPUD finds that project-generated peak wastewater flows contribute to an existing surcharge condition at SSMH BJ25, then STPUD and the project applicant shall either develop plans for and construct improvements that would allow for the conveyance of buildout wastewater flows. Alternatively, the project applicant would be required to pay their fair share towards improvements at SSMH BJ25.  The project applicant shall provide a will-serve letter from STPUD that indicates their wastewater treatment collection and conveyance infrastructure has adequate capacity to serve the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, and that any necessary improvements to the system have been completed prior to the issuance of occupancy permits by the City of South Lake Tahoe.  Significance after Mitigation Implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.5-3 would reduce potentially significant impacts related to sufficient capacity in the STPUD wastewater collection and conveyance system because the project applicant would coordinate with STPUD to determine whether the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in surcharging a segment of pipe in the collection system. If the mixed-use development would require replacement of a 105-foot segment of sewer pipe between SSMH BJ182 and SSMH BJ181 then the applicant would construct, in consultation with STPUD, and pay for the necessary improvement prior to when the capacity would be needed for the mixed-use development. Additionally, if the mixed-use development would require improvements to be made at SSMH BJ25 to serve the project, then the project applicant and STPUD would coordinate the completion of these improvements and/or the project applicant would pay their fair share towards improvements at SSMH BJ25. Replacement of the 105-foot segment of sewer pipe between SSMH BJ182 and SSMH BJ181 would likely include trenching activities within the parking lot of McDonald’s on Lake Tahoe Boulevard, which is outside of the study area for the project. The pipe replacement would not result in ground disturbance of any previously undisturbed areas. Because the construction activities would adhere to standard construction practices (including construction outside of noise-sensitive times of day), no unique noise impacts would occur. No new above ground structures would be constructed, thus there would be no significant effects on views from a scenic roadway. Improvements that could be required at SSMH BJ25, located near Lakeshore Boulevard and Park Avenue outside of the project site, would likely include trenching activities. Infrastructure replacement, which could include sewer pipe, would not result in ground disturbance of any previously undisturbed areas. Because the construction activities would adhere to standard construction practices (including construction outside of noise-sensitive times of day), no unique noise impacts would occur. No new above ground structures would be constructed, thus there would be no significant effects on views from a scenic roadway. Implementation of this measure would reduce impacts to a less-than-significant level for Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the environmental consequences on capacity of the STPUD wastewater collection and conveyance system from implementing Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, with Mitigation Measure 3.5-3 would not be adverse. 3.6 TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION This section evaluates the impacts on the vehicular, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian components of the transportation system that may result from implementation of each of the alternatives. The traffic and transportation regulatory framework and existing environmental setting are described, and the impacts of each alternative are identified and assessed.  The build alternatives involve improvements to existing transportation infrastructure that are scheduled to be constructed by 2020 (or shortly thereafter) and are evaluated for impacts in that year (opening day). Daily trip increases on opening day are the result of trips generated by currently planned development in the project area that is anticipated to be completed by 2020, and by a year-over-year traffic growth rate applied to the region. The adopted Tourist Core Area Plan (TCAP) includes planned development for the vicinity of the project. Total development in that plan area and the Lake Tahoe Region would be controlled by the Lake Tahoe Regional Plan and its limits on land use commodities, such as tourist accommodation units (with or without the project). The proposed transportation improvements are intended to help support revitalization of the tourist core area in a manner consistent with existing plans by enhancing the quality of vehicular and non-vehicular mobility in the area. No new daily trips would be created as a direct result of the transportation improvements under any of the alternatives because the project is a traffic operations project and does not increase overall highway system capacity. The project would accommodate traffic generated by full build out of the TCAP, anticipated to occur by 2040. Because the primary controlling factors on the amount of development in the tourist core area at buildout are the local and regional plans and their limits on land use commodities and because the overall capacity of the highway system would not be increased, indirect growth or inducement of trips beyond those included in the transportation modeling would not occur. Construction of the mixed-use development sites as a relocation opportunity for displaced uses is proposed with Alternatives B, C, and D. It would be constructed after opening day (2020) and before the long-term planning Design Year (2040). The generation of new daily trips would occur only after occupancy of the mixed-use development, so it is evaluated in the 2040 Design Year analysis presented in this section and is summarized in Section 3.19, “Cumulative Impacts,” of the EIR/EIS/EIS.  Several scoping comments were received that related to issues or topics addressed in this section. The City of South Lake Tahoe requested that the EIR/EIS/EIS analyze impacts at all affected intersections and road segments, including surrounding local streets; impacts on bicycle and pedestrian traffic and transit service; and short-term impacts during construction, including construction traffic routing and potential impacts on business access and parking. Other comments requested analysis of vehicle and pedestrian access, traffic flow for businesses in the US 50/Casino Corridor area, impacts on parking, and the potential impact of a roundabout configuration on large semi-trucks traveling through the area. One TRPA and two CEQA threshold topics are dismissed from further evaluation in this section. Because the project involves improvements to existing transportation infrastructure without providing access to previously unserved property or increasing the overall highway system capacity, no new daily trips are anticipated to occur as a result of implementation of the project in this time frame. Thus, the generation of new daily vehicle trips would not occur with project implementation in 2020 and this topic is not discussed further. No alternative would result in increasing, creating, or interfering with waterborne, rail traffic, or air traffic. The project alternatives would have no impact on waterborne or rail traffic and these issues are not discussed further in the EIR/EIS/EIS. None of the build alternatives would install sharp curves or dangerous intersections, or result in incompatible uses, such as farm equipment. Thus, impacts related to increased traffic safety hazards because of a design feature are not discussed further in the EIR/EIS/EIS. In addition, impacts related to recreation access are addressed in Section 3.3, “Parks and Recreational Facilities.” The primary source of information referenced for this section is the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization (Stateline) Project – Caltrans Project Report Traffic Operations Analysis Update (Wood Rodgers 2016a; included as Appendix I of this EIR/EIS/EIS).  3.6.1 Regulatory Setting FEDERAL Federal environmental laws or regulations related to traffic or transportation are applicable to the alternatives evaluated in this EIR/EIS/EIS. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) directs that full consideration should be given to the safe accommodation of pedestrians and bicyclists during the development of federal-aid highway projects (see 23 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 652). It further directs that the special needs of the elderly and the disabled must be considered in all federal-aid projects that include pedestrian facilities. When current or anticipated pedestrian and/or bicycle traffic presents a potential conflict with motor vehicle traffic, every effort must be made to minimize the detrimental effects on all highway users who share the facility.  In July 1999, the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) issued an Accessibility Policy Statement pledging a fully accessible multimodal transportation system. Accessibility in federally assisted programs is governed by the USDOT regulations (49 CFR Part 27) implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 United States Code [USC] 794). FHWA has enacted regulations for the implementation of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), including a commitment to build transportation facilities that provide equal access for all persons. These regulations require application of the ADA requirements to Federal-aid projects, including Transportation Enhancement Activities. TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY  Revised Tahoe Regional Planning Compact (Public Law 09-551) The Tahoe Regional Planning Compact originally adopted in 1969 was revised in 1980, which provided TRPA with the mission to lead the cooperative effort to preserve, restore, and enhance the unique natural and human environment of the Lake Tahoe Region. In addition to providing direction for TRPA to adopt Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities (thresholds) among other duties and operating requirements, the Compact also includes prescriptions for transportation planning as part of the regional plan. As identified by the Compact, the goal of the transportation plan is to reduce dependency on the automobile by making more effective use of existing transportation modes and public transit. Additionally, Article V(2) of the Compact specifically requires consideration of “completion of the Loop Road in the States of California and Nevada.” Lake Tahoe Regional Plan The Regional Plan describes the needs and goals of the Lake Tahoe Region and provides statements of policy to guide decision making as it affects the region’s resources and remaining capacities (TRPA 2012c). The intent of the Regional Plan is to help guide decision making as it affects the growth and development of the Lake Tahoe Region. The Regional Plan directs the planning activities of numerous governmental jurisdictions and utility service districts within the Region. In addition to the Goals and Policies, TRPA’s authority to regulate growth and development in the Region is carried out through implementation of the thresholds, Code of Ordinances, and other guidance documents that include plan area statements (PASs), community plans, and area plans.  Level of Service Requirements Chapter 3, Transportation Element, of the Regional Plan provides goals and policies that are intended to establish a safe, efficient, and integrated transportation system that provides quality mobility options for all sectors of the population, supports the region’s economic base, enhances quality of life, and maximizes opportunities for environmental benefits. The Transportation Element includes transportation goals, policies, and implementation measures that address multiple aspects of transportation planning and interact to create a successful multi-modal transportation system. TRPA’s Goals and Policies set standards for vehicle level of service (LOS) (defined in “Affected Environment” below). The TRPA Goals and Policies require that peak-period traffic flow not exceed the following:   LOS C on rural recreational/scenic roads;  LOS D on rural developed area roads;  LOS D on urban developed area roads;  LOS D for signalized intersections; and  LOS E may be acceptable during peak periods in urban areas, not to exceed four hours per day. Code of Ordinances Changes in daily vehicle trips as a result of a change in project operation are discussed in Section 65.2, Traffic and Air Quality Mitigation Program, of the TRPA Code of Ordinances. A trip is defined as one directional vehicle movement to or from a project area. The Code does not address transportation or traffic related to construction activities. Chapter 65: Air Quality/Transportation of the TRPA Code provides the following definitions related to traffic volumes:  Significant Increase - an increase of more than 200 daily vehicle trips, as determined from the TRPA trip table or other competent technical information;  Minor Increase - an increase of more than 100 but not more than 200 daily vehicle trips, as determined from the TRPA trip table or other competent technical information; and  Insignificant Increase - an increase of 100 or fewer daily vehicle trips, as determined from the TRPA trip table or other competent technical information. If a project results in a significant increase in daily vehicle trips, all traffic and air quality impacts must be mitigated consistent with the environmental thresholds, the Goals and Policies, the Regional Transportation Plan, and the 1992 Air Quality Plan. Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities In August 1982, TRPA adopted Resolution No. 82-11, which included the thresholds related to a variety of resource topics for the Lake Tahoe Region. Although threshold standards are not assigned specifically to transportation, two air quality standards are set forth in terms of basin-wide vehicle miles traveled (VMT) that are applicable to transportation analyses. VMT is a computed value that correlates with the extent of an area’s reliance on the private automobile for trip-making. The TRPA TransCad Transportation Demand model provides a forecast of the number of trips made on the highway network and the distance between trip origins and destinations for each trip purpose. Total VMT is the sum of all these trip lengths.  The TRPA threshold standards includes two air quality standards that relate to transportation in the Region: (1) the reduction in VMT by 10 percent from 1981 base year conditions to reduce nitrate deposition; and (2) the reduction in VMT by 10 percent from 1981 base year conditions to improve visibility. Since the threshold standards were established, and continuing through completion of the most recent TRPA Threshold Evaluation Report (TRPA 2012b), traffic volumes in the Tahoe Basin have continued an overall declining trend, indicating that the basin-wide VMT threshold is currently in attainment. While in attainment, TRPA is mandated to maintain attainment status or develop control measures that will achieve attainment.  Regional Transportation Plan The Tahoe Metropolitan Planning Organization (TMPO) and TRPA jointly developed the Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan and Sustainable Communities Strategy: Mobility 2035 (TMPO and TRPA 2012c) as Lake Tahoe’s blueprint for a regional transportation system that enhances the quality of life in the Tahoe Region, promotes sustainability, and offers improved mobility options for people and goods. Important objectives of the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) are to reduce the overall environmental impact of transportation in the Region, create walkable and vibrant communities, and provide real alternatives to driving. The RTP update included a Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS), in accordance with California Senate Bill 375, statutes of 2008 (Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act). The RTP presents 14 goals consistent with regional and federal requirements that focus on reducing dependency on the automobile and giving preference to projects that increase the capacity of the Region’s transportation system through public transportation projects and programs. TMPO is updating the 2012 RTP in 2016; the update will include a review of the actions included to carry out the existing goals, so it reflects the same overall direction for transportation in the Region and is a refinement of the current plan’s implementation approach. Level of Service Requirements The RTP focuses on long-range transportation planning and has established LOS criteria consistent with those in the Regional Plan. These vehicle LOS standards may be exceeded when provisions for transit, bicycling, and walking facilities would provide a mobility level proportional to the mobility level that would be provided in the existing plus project condition on affected roadways.  Parking Requirements The RTP identifies parking-related policies to encourage shared parking (Policy 8.1), parking management programs with incentives to improvements benefiting transit users, pedestrians, and bicyclists (Policy 8.2), and parking management strategies that are tailored to the needs of each specific location and promote pedestrian and transit use (Policy 8.3). Bicycle and Pedestrian Requirements The RTP identifies a goal to encourage bicycle and pedestrian movement as viable and significant modes of transportation in Lake Tahoe. The adopted policies to support this overarching goal are designed to promote walkable, mixed-use centers and bicycle- and pedestrian-friendly communities. RTP Policy 2.4 states that intersections and driveways shall be designed and sited to minimize impacts on public transportation, adjacent roadways and intersections, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities. Transit Access The RTP provides goals and policies that increase the viability of transit systems through improvement of mass transit (Policy 4.1), inter- and intra-regional transportation (Policies 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3), and intermodal transportation facilities (Policy 7.1). Policy 7.2 requires major commercial interests and employers to provide or participate in joint shuttle services or provide transit use incentives to their guests, patrons, and employees. Such programs could include carpool and vanpool matching programs, employee shuttles, on-site secure bicycle storage and shower facilities, flexible work hours, and parking and transit use incentives. Safety The RTP places heavy significance on safety along regional roadways as demonstrated through the stated goals and policies. The overall goal of upgrading regional roadways as necessary to improve safety, and provide for a more efficient, integrated transportation system is supported by Policy 10.4, which minimizes the number of driveways and access points to parking lots from major travel routes and major local roadways. Linking Tahoe: Active Transportation Plan The Linking Tahoe: Active Transportation Plan (ATP), formerly the Lake Tahoe Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan, presents a guide for planning, designing, constructing, and maintaining a regional active transportation network that includes innovative infrastructure, support facilities, and awareness programs. The infrastructure network includes on-street bicycle lanes and bicycle routes, and off-street paths and sidewalks. The ATP depicts existing and planned, shared-use paths, bike lanes, bike routes, and sidewalks within the study area in addition to the rest of the Tahoe Basin (TMPO and TRPA 2016:4-31). The existing network includes 120 miles of bicycle and pedestrian shared-use paths, bicycle lanes, bicycle routes, and sidewalks and proposes another 68 miles of new bicycle and pedestrian facilities. The built-out bicycle and pedestrian network is estimated to reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by 8,500 miles on a peak summer day (TMPO and TRPA 2016:1-20). The ATP also identifies goals, policies, actions, and performance measures for local governing bodies and transportation agencies. The policies relevant to the locally preferred action pertain to the active transportation network design, facility maintenance, multi-modal connections, and project implementation. STATE California California Department of Transportation Caltrans is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the state highway system in California. Caltrans has the following concept LOS for Caltrans facilities in the study area:  Concept LOS D: The concept LOS for US 50 is LOS D in rural areas (east of the community of Cedar Grove in El Dorado County) Additionally, Caltrans staff has indicated that LOS E is acceptable on Caltrans facilities, if such operations meet the TRPA standard of LOS E for no more than four hours per day (Wood Rodgers 2016a).  Caltrans, as assigned by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), directs that full consideration should be given to the safe accommodation of pedestrians and bicyclists during the development of federal-aid highway projects (see 23 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 652). It further directs that the special needs of the elderly and the disabled must be considered in all federal-aid projects that include pedestrian facilities. When current or anticipated pedestrian and/or bicycle traffic presents a potential conflict with motor vehicle traffic, every effort must be made to minimize the detrimental effects on all highway users who share the facility. Nevada Nevada Department of Transportation NDOT is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the state highway system in Nevada. NDOT defines a significant impact on traffic operations as deterioration of state highway facility operations (intersections, state highways, and ramp terminals) beyond LOS D. LOCAL Local plans that are relevant to the portion of the project in California are the TCAP and the City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan. For the portion of the project located in Nevada, the South Shore Area Plan (SSAP) and the Douglas County Master Plan are the relevant local plans. A summary of relevant policies from these planning documents are included below.  Tourist Core Area Plan Level of Service Requirements Section 6, “Traffic and Circulation,” of the TCAP (City of South Lake Tahoe 2013) sets forth goals and policies for transportation and recommends strategies to enhance mobility patterns by enabling users to satisfy their travel needs while supporting the area’s environmental, social, and recreational goals. Policy T-1.2 sets a standard of LOS D or better on all arterials, collectors and at signalized intersections, with limited exceptions for peak-periods for up to 4 hours per day when provisions for multi-modal amenities and/or services are adequate to provide mobility for users. Parking Requirements The TCAP presents the goal of providing adequate parking facilities that are integrated with and support a walkable, vibrant tourist core. Policies supporting this goal include encouraging underground, shared, and on-street parking to promote a pedestrian-friendly main street (Policy T-6.1) and to reducing the parking requirement for projects in pedestrian areas, areas with concentration of overnight accommodations, and in areas served by transit (Policy T-6.2). Bicycle and Pedestrian Requirements The TCAP encourages the provision of adequate pedestrian and bicycle facilities, such as continuous sidewalks, bike paths, and bike lanes throughout the plan area that connect commercial, entertainment and recreation areas of the plan (Policy T-2.2). The TCAP is also guided by the principle of creating complete streets in the South Shore Area that allow for multiple uses including automobiles, bikes and pedestrian (Goal 5 and Policy T-5.1). Transit Access The TCAP provides transit-related goals and policies that promote the use and expansion of multi-modal transportation options, including transit for visitors and residents. Policies include ensuring that the TCAP is served by frequent bus service along US 50 and along routes that provide access to the lake and other recreation opportunities and ensuring that adequate bus shelters and bus pullout are installed throughout the tourist core (Policy T-4.1). South Shore Area Plan The SSAP (Douglas County and TRPA 2013a) was developed consistent with the Goals and Policies of the Lake Tahoe Regional Plan and includes four separate components that are integrated into Douglas County planning documents: the Douglas County Master Plan, Zoning Map, Development Code, and Design Criteria and Improvement Standards.  Parking Requirements The SSAP includes design standards and guidelines (Douglas County and TRPA 2013b) in Section 2.3, “Parking Structures,” that encourage structured parking as a means of reducing overall site coverage where parking demand necessitates such a solution. Additionally, the SSAP encourages such structures to be intuitively located without visually dominating a project. Bicycle and Pedestrian Requirements and Transit Access The design standards and guidelines included within the SSAP encourages that separate vehicular and pedestrian systems be provided (Section 2.5.2). Additionally, the SSAP states that pedestrian linkages within developments, and linkages to surrounding developments and trails/bikeways should be provided and emphasized. The design standards and guidelines promote alternative transportation modes such as walking, bicycling, transit use, and shared parking strategies that, at a minimum, shall include continuous sidewalks or other pedestrian paths and bicycle facilities along both sides of all highways with connections to other major activity centers (Section 2.5.8). City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan Level of Service Requirements The Transportation and Circulation Element of the City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan (City of South Lake Tahoe 2011) provides the policy context for the City of South Lake Tahoe to achieve its vision for future transportation and circulation. The General Plan contains goals and policies designed to create a well‐connected transportation network that serves all residents and visitors. Policy TC-1.2 identifies LOS D as the minimum level for all city streets and intersections, with up to four hours per day of LOS E being acceptable.  Bicycle and Pedestrian Requirements The Transportation and Circulation Element of the City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan provides goals and policies that encourage the improvement of bicycle and pedestrian connections between all neighborhoods and communities, and the integration and linking of existing city bicycle paths with the regional bicycle network. Douglas County Master Plan The Transportation Element of the Douglas County Master Plan (Douglas County 2011) describes existing conditions and highlights current and future issues related to transportation and traffic in the county. It identifies proposed roadway projects required to maintain target LOS and describes both vehicular transportation and transit, as well as bicycle, pedestrian, trail, and aviation systems.  The Transportation Element contains specific references to the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Plan. Lake Tahoe Transportation (LTT) Policy 1 commits Douglas County to participate in and support transportation projects at Lake Tahoe consistent with the Tahoe Revitalization initiative. LT T Action 1.1 specifically commits the county to participate in the US 50/South Shore project. Transit Access / Bicycle and Pedestrian Requirements Through a set of goals, policies, and actions, the Douglas County Master Plan encourages alternative modes of transportation to reduce VMT and improve the Lake Tahoe experience. These policies include the implementation of planned bicycle and pedestrian paths and the continual development of bicycle and pedestrian plans and facilities throughout the area covered by the Douglas County Master Plan. Under LT T Policy 1, LT T Action 1.2 commits Douglas County to continual participation in efforts to complete the Nevada Stateline-to-Stateline Bikeway Project and other identified bicycle and multi-use trail projects within Douglas County at Lake Tahoe.  3.6.2 Affected Environment The project site is within a 1.1-mile-long corridor encompasses the casino tourist core in the Stateline area, the Heavenly Village area, and adjacent commercial, lodging, and residential areas. The study area is defined by the following boundary points:  US 50, 1,800 feet west of its intersection with Pioneer Trail;  Pioneer Trail, 1,400 feet south of its intersection with US 50;  The “Loop Road,” consisting of Pine Boulevard to the west and Lake Parkway to the east; and  US 50, 200 feet north of its intersection with Kingsbury Grade (Nevada State Route 207) See Exhibit 3.6-1 for a map of the project vicinity and the intersections analyzed in this section.  EXISTING TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES US Highway 50 (US 50) is a State and trans-continental highway that traverses east-west through the study area. Caltrans District 3’s US 50 Transportation Concept Report and Corridor System Management Plan (Caltrans 2014a) categorizes the study corridor segment of US 50 as a “4-lane conventional urban arterial with a center turn lane.” The US 50 study corridor segment is functionally classified as a “Freeway & Expressway” and Terminal Access Route. The corridor is considered a National Highway System route and an Interregional Road System route, but not a scenic route or lifeline route.  Regionally, US 50 connects the Sacramento metropolitan region in California to Carson City in Nevada and beyond. Within the study area, US 50 is a four-lane arterial with a continuous two-way left-turn median lane that transitions to dedicated left-turn pockets at major intersections. In the vicinity, US 50 has signal-controlled intersections at Kingsbury Grade (Nevada State Route 207), Lake Parkway, Stateline Avenue, Friday Avenue, Park Avenue, Pioneer Trail, and Wildwood Avenue. Based on a review of Caltrans 2014 traffic count data, the US 50 segment east of Pioneer Trail and west of Park Avenue experiences AADT of 27,500 vehicles and a peak month ADT of 34,500 vehicles (Caltrans 2015). Based on 2014 NDOT traffic counts, the AADT on US 50 was 21,500 vehicles approximately 300 feet east of the California-Nevada border (NDOT 2015a).     Exhibit 3.6-1 Project Vicinity and Study Intersections   Pioneer Trail is a two-lane arterial that connects US 50 in the unincorporated community of Meyers to US 50 (Lake Tahoe Boulevard) near Stateline. Within the study area, Pioneer Trail intersects US 50 at a signalized intersection east of its intersection with Ski Run Boulevard. As the only east-west parallel alternative route to US 50, Pioneer Trail currently carries approximately 10,800 vehicles per day according to the most recent 2014 traffic counts from El Dorado County’s Hourly Traffic Count Reports database (El Dorado County 2015). Lake Parkway is a two-lane bi-directional loop road that intersects Stateline Avenue and Pine Boulevard on the west side of US 50 and intersects Heavenly Village Parkway on the east side of US 50. The posted speed limit on Lake Parkway varies from 25 to 35 miles per hour (mph). Lake Parkway West forms the secondary access loop roadway on the west (Lake Tahoe) side of US 50 in Nevada, providing access to/from the Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course, a bank building, and the rear of Harvey’s and the Hard Rock Hotel on the Nevada side of Stateline. At the state line, it connects to Pine Boulevard, which extends farther west to connect with Park Avenue. Lake Parkway East is the loop roadway on the east (mountain) side of US 50 and on the Nevada side. It provides access to/from the rear of Montbleu Resort and Casino and Harrah’s and connects to Montreal Road at Heavenly Village Way. Lake Parkway West and East intersect with US 50 at a signalized intersection that provides protected left-turn movements from US 50. Stateline Avenue is a two-lane local roadway in the Stateline area that is aligned immediately adjacent to the California/Nevada border in California. Land uses along Stateline Avenue consist mainly of hotel and motel lodging units, with some single-family residences on the north end near Lake Tahoe. Stateline Avenue intersects US 50 at a signalized intersection that operates with protected left-turn movements from US 50. The fourth (southern) leg of this intersection provides an entrance-only driveway access to the Lake Tahoe Resort Hotel. Park Avenue/Heavenly Village Way is a two-lane local roadway serving the Stateline area. Park Avenue serves residential traffic, as well as recreational traffic associated with the various hotel/casino and retail uses in the Stateline area. The Park Avenue intersection with US 50 is signalized, with protected east-west left-turn movements from US 50. Heavenly Village Way forms the southeast leg of this intersection and provides direct access to the Heavenly Village redevelopment area south of US 50. Heavenly Village Way continues southeast and connects with Montreal Road/Lake Parkway East. Pine Boulevard is a two-lane bi-directional roadway with a posted speed limit of 25 mph that runs west of and parallel to US 50. Pine Boulevard runs north/south within South Lake Tahoe and becomes Lake Parkway West when it crosses the Nevada/California state line to the north. The predominant land uses along this roadway consist of hotel/motel and residential land uses.  Montreal Road is a two-lane local roadway that extends from Chonokis Road on the west to Heavenly Village Way on the east and continues as Lake Parkway East farther east to connect to US 50. Montreal Road is an alternate route to US 50 for the critical segment between Pioneer Trail and Heavenly Village Way. Montreal Road currently carries approximately 6,000-7,000 vehicles per day (Hauge Brueck Associates 2015).  Local roads within/near the study area include Chonokis Road, Moss Road, and Echo Road. These two-lane residential roadways are located east of Pioneer Trail just south of the Heavenly Village Center. These three local roads provide access between Pioneer Trail and Montreal Road and are heavily used as “cut-through” routes to access Lake Parkway East from Pioneer Trail, bypassing congestion on US 50 through the tourist core. Because of the large volume of cut-through traffic, these local roadways experience higher-than-typical daily traffic volumes and speeds.  HISTORIC AND EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUMES Historic Traffic Trends Caltrans and NDOT- AADT count data from 1992 through 2014 were reviewed for the study segments of US 50 that extend from west of Pioneer Trail to east of Stateline Avenue. Table 3.6-1 illustrates the US 50 study segment traffic volumes from 1992 through 2014. Table 3.6-1 US 50 Segments through Study Intersections - Recent Traffic Trends (1992-2014)  Year  US 50 Two-Way AADT Volumes  Just west of  Pioneer Trail   Between Pioneer Trail and Park Avenue  Just east of  Park Avenue  Just west of Stateline Avenue  Just east of Stateline Avenue  Just east of  Kingsbury Grade  1992  40,000  47,000  46,000  34,000  31,100  n/a  1993  40,000  47,000  46,000  34,000  29,300  n/a  1994  40,000  47,000  46,000  34,000  29,070  n/a  1995  38,000  44,000  44,000  33,000  28,740  n/a  1996  35,500  41,000  44,500  33,000  27,900  n/a  1997  35,500  41,000  44,500  33,000  27,900  n/a  1998  35,500  41,000  44,500  33,000  26,700  n/a  1999  35,500  41,000  44,500  29,500  26,700  n/a  2000  35,500  41,000  44,500  28,000  27,800  n/a  2001  35,500  41,000  44,500  29,000  27,300  n/a  2002  35,500  41,000  34,000  33,000  27,600  n/a  2003  32,000  37,500  34,000  33,000  30,500  n/a  2004  32,500  37,500  33,500  33,000  30,800  n/a  2005  32,500  36,000  32,000  33,000  28,900  27,700  2006  32,500  35,500  29,000  30,500  26,500  23,700  2007  32,500  35,000  29,000  30,500  25,000  20,000  2008  31,500  33,000  28,500  28,000  25,000  20,000  2009  31,500  31,500  27,500  27,500  24,000  21,000  2010  31,500  28,500  26,500  26,500  24,000  22,000  2011  31,500  29,000  26,500  26,000  27,000  24,000  2012  31,500  29,000  26,500  25,500  22,500  21,000  2013  31,500  29,000  26,500  25,500  21,500  22,000  2014  31,500  27,500  24,600  25,000  21,500  25,000  Notes: At certain locations, Caltrans and NDOT counts may have been actually conducted only once in every 3 years. AADT = average annual daily traffic; n/a = data not available Sources: Caltrans 2015, NDOT 2015a   As seen in Table 3.6-1, traffic volumes along the identified US 50 study segments have been decreasing, for the most part, over the last 22 years. However, AADT on US 50 east of Kingsbury Grade Road has increased by approximately 20 percent between 2012 and 2014. This is likely because of increased “cut-through” traffic using Montreal Road and Lake Parkway East to bypass US 50 near the casinos. “Cut-through” traffic refers to the travel patterns of vehicles through the Rocky Point neighborhood throughout the year to move quickly around the tourist core. Travelers knowledgeable about the local street network tend to use back streets as diversion routes to bypass the tourist core that are faster than using US 50. Based on 5-year AADT counts on Pioneer Trail, AADT on Pioneer Trail at South Lake Tahoe city limit has increased from 9,218 in 2011 to 10,772 in 2014 (approximately 17 percent growth). This growth in traffic on Pioneer Trail west of the study area and on US 50 near Kingsbury Grade, combined with the decrease in volumes on US 50 through the tourist core, also suggests that vehicles are likely bypassing US 50 near the casinos by using Montreal Road and Lake Parkway East. Existing Traffic Volumes As stated above, this traffic analysis relies on the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization (Stateline) Project – Caltrans Project Report – Traffic Counts, Forecasts and Operations Update (Wood Rodgers 2016a). Several development and highway projects were being evaluated during the timeframe for preparation of this EIR/EIS/EIS; to provide a level of consistency in the various traffic analyses, the Wood Rodgers study relied initially on traffic counts conducted for the Heavenly Mountain Resort Epic Discovery Project EIR/EIS (Hauge Brueck Associates 2015). Although those traffic counts were conducted in December 2013, a comparison of the data to Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) data from summer 2013 and 2015 indicates that, for the most part, the differences between those periods were minimal (+/- 1 percent). Minor adjustments were made in some cases where current conditions warranted them. (See the Wood Rodgers traffic study [Appendix I of this EIR/EIS/EIS] for a more detailed description of these adjustments.) Therefore, the existing traffic volumes discussed in this analysis reflect 2015 conditions. Summer peak hour is defined as the highest one-hour traffic volume between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. in July and/or August. Existing (2015) annual average peak hour and summer peak hour traffic volumes for study area roadway intersections are presented in Exhibit 3.6-2. EXISTING INTERSECTION AND ROADWAY SEGMENT LEVELS OF SERVICE Intersection traffic operations were quantified for the study area intersections under existing traffic conditions, as presented in this section. Note that for traffic operational analysis purposes, US 50 is considered an east-west route and all intersecting cross-streets are regarded as north-south streets.  Intersection Operations Table  3.6-2 summarizes intersection traffic operations in the study area for existing traffic volumes (shown in Exhibit 3.6-2) and current intersection geometrics and controls. As shown in Table 3.6-2, all study area intersections are operating at annual average and summer peak hour LOS D or better under existing conditions.  Table 3.6-2 Intersection Traffic Operations for Existing Conditions  #  Intersection  Control Type  Annual Average Peak Hour  Summer Peak Hour  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  1  Park Avenue / Pine Boulevard  TWSC1  9.9  A  10.3  B  2  Pine Boulevard / Stateline Avenue  AWSC2  8.1  A  8.5  A  3  US 50 / Pioneer Trail  Signal2   18.7  B   37.5  D  4  US 50 / Park Avenue / Heavenly Village Way  Signal   15.6  B   22.8  C  5  US 50 / Friday Avenue  Signal   5.0  A   7.5  A  6  US 50 / Stateline Avenue  Signal   8.1  A   11.1  B  7  US 50 / Lake Parkway  Signal   14.8  B   19.9  B  8  Lake Parkway / Heavenly Village Way  AWSC  10.5  B  12.6  B  9  Lake Parkway / Harrah’s Road  TWSC  14.3  B  17.1  C  Notes: AWSC = all-way stop controlled; LOS = level of service; S/V = seconds per vehicle; TWSC = two-way stop-controlled. 1 “Worst case” control delays (in seconds/vehicle [S/V]) are indicated for two-way stop-controlled (TWSC) intersections. 2 “Average” control delays (in seconds/vehicle] S/V]) are indicated for signal-controlled and all-way stop-controlled (AWSC) intersections. Source: Wood Rodgers 2016a      Exhibit 3.6-2 Existing Traffic Volumes (Year 2015)   Roadway Segment Operations Table 3.6-3 shows peak hour operations by directional segment for arterials/highways in the study area under existing conditions. Table 3.6-3 Arterial/Highway Segment Traffic Operations under Existing Conditions  Arterial Segment  Arterial Class1  Direction  Annual Average Peak Hour  Summer Peak Hour  Speed2  LOS  Speed2  LOS  US 50 (between Pioneer Trail and Lake Parkway)  III  EB  22.2  C  19.1  C  US 50 (through Pioneer Trail and Lake Parkway)  III  WB  21.6  C  20.5  C  Notes: EB = eastbound; LOS = level of service; WB = westbound. 1 With a free-flow speed of approximately 35 mph for US 50, the study area roadway segments are regarded as a Class III Arterial as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual, 2010 edition (Transportation Research Board 2010). 2 Speed = average travel speed in miles per hour. Source: Wood Rodgers 2016a  As shown in Table 3.6-3, segment operations (progression) at study area arterials are currently LOS C or better under both annual average and summer peak-hour conditions.  TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS Caltrans provided accident data for the study area’s US 50 roadway segments within California for the 3-year period between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2013. NDOT provided accident data for the 3-year period from October 1, 2012, through October 1, 2015. As shown in Table 3.6-4, at the US 50 and Pioneer Trail, Park Avenue, and Stateline Avenue intersections, the accident rates are lower than the state average accident rates for fatal, fatal + injury (F+I), and total accidents. The US 50/Lake Parkway Loop intersection had the most reported accidents (14), as well as the most reported injury accidents (4). The US 50/Lake Parkway Loop intersection had accident rates higher than the state average accident rates for F+I and total accidents. Of the 14 accidents at the US 50/Lake Parkway Loop intersection, most (10) were collisions between multiple vehicles. “Rear-end” (6) was the most commonly reported type of collision. Table 3.6-4 Accident Data Summary (Intersections)  Intersection Location (Post Mile) – Jurisdiction  Number of Accidents  Persons  Actual Accident Rates  (# of accidents / MV)  Average Accident Rates (# of accidents / MV)  Tot  Fat  Inj  F+I  Multi Veh  Wet  Dark  Kld  Inj  Fat  F+I  Tot  Fat  F+I  Tot  US 50/ Pioneer Trail  (PM 80.015) – Caltrans1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.001  0.09  0.21  US 50/ Park Avenue (PM 80.140) – Caltrans1  2  0  1  1  1  0  0  0  2  0.00  0.02  0.04  0.001  0.11  0.27  US 50/Stateline Avenue (PM 80.439) – Caltrans1  2  0  0  0  1  0  2  0  0  0.00  0.00  0.06  0.001  0.11  0.27  US 50/Lake Parkway Loop - NDOT2  14  0  4  4  10  6  8  0  5  0.00  0.13  0.46  0.001  0.11  0.27  Note: Caltrans = California Department of Transportation; Fat = fatalities; F+I = fatalities + injuries; Inj = injuries; Kld = killed; MV = million vehicles; NDOT = Nevada Department of Transportation; PM = post mile; Tot = total; Veh = vehicles. 1 Caltrans District 3 accident data covers the period from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2013.

The Stateline Transit Center is located at the intersection of US 50 and Transit Way, within the study area. Three BlueGO bus routes operate within the study area:   Route 50 operates between the South Y and Kingsbury Transit Centers from 5:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. with 1-hour headways.  Route 53 operates between the South Y and Kingsbury Transit Centers at 1-hour headways from about 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Monday through Saturday with special hours offered on Sundays, holidays, and late nights.  Route 23 operates between the Stateline and Kingsbury Transit Centers and The Ridge Resort/Heavenly Mountain Resort from approximately 7:00 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. at 1-hour headways with extended service hours on Fridays and Saturdays.  BlueGO offers wintertime ski shuttle routes from Heavenly Mountain Resort to various South Shore and ski destinations. TTD offers a Demand Response Service to serve patrons under the Americans with Disabilities Act throughout the area, available during fixed-route service hours. Additionally, TTD offers two commuter routes with the Lake and Valley Express:  Route 20x operates between South Lake Tahoe and Gardnerville on the Kingsbury Grade. Weekday service is provided from 5:15 a.m. to 9:40 a.m. and from 3:40 p.m. to 6:40 p.m. Weekend service is provided from 5:25 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and from 2:35 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.  Route 21x operates between South Lake Tahoe and Carson City on US 50. Weekday service is provided from 5:30 a.m. to 9:33 a.m. and from 2:05 p.m. to 7:43 p.m. Weekend service is provided from 5:30 a.m. to 9:28 a.m. and from 2:30 p.m. to 7:28 p.m. Since 2000, ridership on the BlueGo has been somewhat declining (see Table 3.6-5). Between 2002 and 2006, ridership peaked with approximately one million to 1.2 million riders (Norberg, pers. comm., 2016). In 2013, BlueGo had approximately 765,000 riders. Table 3.6-5 South Shore BlueGo Ridership  Year  Total Riders  Year  Total Riders  2000  975,998  2007  831,384  2001  939,127  2008  984,134  2002  1,009,720  2009  752,699  2003  1,222,548  2010  846,795  2004  1,123,825  2011  826,738  2005  1,160,166  2012  808,826  2006  1,048,906  2013  765,348  Source: Norberg, pers. comm., 2016  BIKEWAYS AND PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES The study area currently includes bicycle and pedestrian facilities through much of the Lake Tahoe perimeter area. In South Lake Tahoe, bike lanes exist on Heavenly Village Parkway and Pioneer Trail. A separated Class I facility is provided within the linear park along the northwest side of US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Ski Run Boulevard.  Caltrans classifies bikeways as follows:   Class I Bikeway (Bike Path) provides a completely separated right-of-way for the exclusive use of bicycles and pedestrians with crossflow by motorists minimized.   Class II Bikeway (Bike Lane) provides a striped lane for one-way bicycle travel on a street or highway.  Class III Bikeway (Bike Route) provides for shared use by bicycle or motor vehicle traffic, typically on lower volume roadways.   Class IV Bikeway (Separated Bikeway/Cycle Track) is a bikeway for the exclusive use of bicycles and includes a separation required between the separated bikeway and the through vehicular traffic; the separation may include, but is not limited to, grade separation, flexible posts, inflexible physical barriers, or on-street parking. Exhibit 3.6-3 shows the existing bicycle facilities in the area.  Within the study area, some segments of sidewalks are present on US 50 and Heavenly Village Way east of US 50. A pedestrian underpass beneath US 50 between Harvey’s Hotel and Casino and Harrah’s Resort allows pedestrians to travel between the casino buildings. Protected pedestrian crossing of US 50 is provided at Pioneer Trail, Park Avenue, Friday Avenue, Stateline Avenue, and Lake Parkway. A pedestrian scramble is provided on US 50 east of Stateline Avenue, between Montbleu Resort and Casino and Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. Sidewalks are limited along most local street within the study area and have frequent discontinuities.  3.6.3 Environmental Consequences ANALYSIS METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS Traffic operations have been quantified through the determination of LOS. LOS is a qualitative measure of traffic operating conditions, whereby a letter grade (A through F) is assigned to an intersection or roadway segment, representing progressively worsening traffic operations.  LOS in the study area was calculated for all intersection control types using methods documented in the Transportation Research Board publication Highway Capacity Manual, Fifth Edition, 2010 (HCM-2010). For signalized and all-way-stop-controlled (AWSC) intersections, the intersection delay and corresponding LOS were determined for each approach and the average calculated for the entire intersection. For roundabouts and two-way-stop-controlled (TWSC) intersections, delay and corresponding LOS for each approach was determined. The delay-based HCM-2010 LOS criteria for signalized and stop-controlled intersections are outlined in Table 3.6-6.  The roadway segment analysis uses average travel speed to determine LOS. Table 3.6-7 shows the speed-based LOS threshold for different types of urban street classifications. The Caltrans’ Guide for the Preparation of Traffic Impact Studies (2002) states: Caltrans endeavors to maintain a target LOS at the transition between LOS “C” and LOS “D” on State highway facilities, however, Caltrans acknowledges that this may not be always feasible and recommends that the lead agency consult with Caltrans to determine the appropriate target LOS. During completion of the US 50 Bypass Project Study Report Development, March 18, 2009, Caltrans staff indicated that LOS E is acceptable on Caltrans facilities if such operations meet the TRPA standard of LOS E for no more than four hours per day (Wood Rodgers 2016b).    Exhibit 3.6-3 Existing Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities    Table 3.6-6 LOS Definitions and Criteria for Intersections  LOS  Flow Type  Operational Characteristics  Intersection Control Delay (seconds/vehicle)  Signal Control  Roundabouts or Two-Way-Stop or All-Way Stop Control  A  Stable Flow  Free-flow conditions with negligible to minimal delays.

These are the intersection LOS targets used for this environmental analysis. TRPA-defined vehicle LOS standards may be exceeded when provisions for multi-modal amenities and/or services (such as transit, bicycling, and walking facilities) are adequate to provide mobility for users at a level that is proportional to the project-generated traffic in relation to overall traffic conditions on affected roadways.  Synchro and SimTraffic 8 operational analysis software was used to implement the HCM-2010 analysis procedures for intersection and arterial segment operations, respectively. SIDRA Version 6.0 software was used to evaluate roundabout operations. For LOS analysis, a general suburban peak-hour factor of 0.92 (as recommended by HCM-2010) has been used in the study area intersection analyses under all scenarios. Based on a review of Caltrans and NDOT AADT and truck counts for 2007-2014, a heavy-vehicle factor of 3 percent in the peak-hour periods was applied to US 50 east-west through approaches at the study area intersections and a 2 percent peak-hour heavy-vehicle factor was used for the north-south local street approaches. The heavy-vehicle percentages mentioned are based on truck AADT volumes and are representative of the AADT conditions.  Saturation flow rates of 1,300 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) for summer peak hour, and 1,500 vphpl for annual average peak hour, were used for eastbound and westbound movements at the US 50 study area intersections west of and including the US 50/Stateline Avenue intersection. A saturation flow rate of 1,750 vphpl was used for all other study area intersections and turning movements, including facilities on Pine Boulevard and Lake Parkway. Saturation flow rate represents the number of vehicles that can pass through an intersection during an hour of green time. The saturation flow rates were reduced for the purpose of this analysis to reflect the observed conditions of low travel speeds and significant queueing along US 50 during the peak period. The low travel speed and queueing are caused by a variety of factors, including high volumes of bicycle and pedestrian crossings, the large number of high-volume driveways along the corridor, and smaller-than-typical lane widths in some locations.  TRAFFIC FORECAST METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS This discussion explains the methods and assumptions used in development of the 2020 and 2040 traffic forecasts and the resulting roadway and intersection operational analyses. Assumptions and Analysis Techniques Analysis Timeframes Construction of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project is scheduled for completion by 2020, or shortly thereafter. As described above, the proposed transportation improvements in the build alternatives would not directly result in the generation of new traffic trips in the study area; however, 2020 (opening day) conditions for this analysis does include trips generated by planned development in the project area that is anticipated to be completed by 2020 and by a year-over-year traffic growth rate applied to the region, as well as trips lost as a result of residential and business acquisitions required under Alternatives B, C, and D. The traffic analysis addresses the traffic effects of redistributing existing and forecasted traffic in the study area with implementation of the build alternatives. To do so, the traffic analysis developed 2020 forecasted traffic volumes and distributions.  TTD has committed to constructing replacement housing for displaced residents associated with Alternatives B, C, and D before initiating right-of-way acquisition and constructing transportation improvements in California. For the purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that a portion or all of one or more of the mixed-use development sites would be constructed before 2020. The remainder of the mixed-use development sites are expected to be constructed subsequent to the completion of the transportation improvements (opening day), but before 2040. The analysis focuses on Site 3, because redevelopment of Site 1 before the transportation improvements is not feasible given its location on existing US 50, and Site 2 is located at the edge of the existing Rocky Point neighborhood and would displace businesses that generate similar traffic volumes where the impact on existing intersection operations is expected to be minimal. The trip generation at Site 3 is evaluated for a period leading up to opening day—a time when Site 3 is developed on the existing roadway network—and before completion of the transportation improvements. This analysis is compared with the Alternative A: No Build condition when the residents located in their existing homes in the Rocky Point Neighborhood. Complete buildout of the mixed-use development sites would be expected by 2040, so trip generation for the three sites is included in the long-term buildout analysis. Intersection operations for the build alternatives are discussed in comparison to Alternative A: No Build (No Project); the analysis focuses on intersection operations, rather than roadway segment operations, because they have a higher likelihood of being adversely impacted. Traffic operations for major transportation improvement projects are typically evaluated over a 20-year planning/design horizon. With the proposed US 50 transportation improvements anticipated to be complete by 2020, 2040 is regarded as the long-term planning horizon and design year. The 2040 (design year) traffic conditions were developed by assuming full build-out of the TCAP by 2040 in a manner that is consistent with the Regional Plan. The 2040 conditions also assumed the full build-out of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, so that the transportation improvements would accommodate the traffic of this redevelopment.  Pedestrian Conflicts The analysis conducted for the study area accounts for pedestrian conflicts by incorporating pedestrian volumes and pedestrian signal phases, with estimated calls per hour, for the existing pedestrian crossings at each study area intersection. Pedestrian conflicts per hour at each study area intersection were estimated based on proximity to the commercial/retail core of the study area network (i.e., the US 50/Stateline Avenue intersection). Additionally, the existing signalized intersection with pedestrian scramble located between Harrah’s Hotel and Casino and Hard Rock Hotel and Casino was modeled for those alternatives under which it continues to exist which includes Alternatives A, B, C, and D.  LOS E Conditions For study area facilities that are under local agency jurisdiction, TRPA-defined LOS D operations were used as the minimum acceptable threshold; however, peak-hour LOS E is regarded as acceptable if the duration of such operations do not exceed four hours per day. Caltrans staff has indicated that LOS E is acceptable on Caltrans facilities if such operations meet the TRPA standard of LOS E for no more than four hours per day. To determine whether a location is projected to operate at LOS E for more than four hours per day, hourly traffic volumes were obtained from the PeMS database for Fridays and Saturdays during summer 2015 on US 50 near Midway Road (closest available count station to the study area). It was determined from the summer hourly counts that the fifth highest hour of traffic volumes throughout a summer day was typically about 6 percent lower than the traffic volumes during the peak hour. Therefore, any facilities projected to operate at LOS E during the peak hour were reanalyzed with 6 percent lower volumes (i.e., analyzed under the fifth highest hour traffic conditions). If these 6 percent lower volumes still resulted in the facility operating at LOS E, it was determined that the LOS E conditions lasted for more than four hours. Year 2020 (No Build) Traffic Forecasts Year 2020 (No Build) traffic forecasts were calculated by estimating trips that would be generated by local projects that are expected to be completed by 2020 and distributing/adding those trips onto the 2015 annual average and summer peak traffic counts. Approved projects that are currently under construction, or scheduled to begin construction prior to 2020, were identified based on information from local business owners and TRPA staff, knowledge of the study area, and projects coded into the TRPA travel demand model. The following development projects were assumed to be completed under 2020 conditions:  Edgewood Lodge Development: approximately 154 hotel rooms and 40 timeshare residences, as well as a health spa, restaurant, and conference center;  Zalanta Resort at the Village: 30 condominiums;  Beach Club redevelopment: approximately 143 single family detached homes as well as a recreational beach, swim club, and pier;  Sierra Colina Village development: 42 townhouse units in 21 duplex buildings and eight single family detached homes; and  pedestrian scramble at US 50/Stateline Avenue intersection. More information about these future improvements is provided in Appendix I (Wood Rodgers 2016a). Trip Generation Trip generation rates from the Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition (ITE 2012) were used to estimate trips generated by the future developments listed above. A detailed summary of all trip generation rates, reduction factors, and total estimated trips for each project alternative are shown in the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization (Stateline) Project – Caltrans Project Report Traffic Operations Analysis Update (Appendix I; Wood Rodgers 2016a).  Trip Distribution Existing (2015), 2020 No Build, and 2040 No Build traffic volumes were redistributed as necessary to calculate “with project” traffic forecasts for Alternatives B (Triangle), C (Triangle One-Way), and D (PSR Alt 2). Alternatives B and D have the same traffic volume forecasts because the only major difference between the two is the location of the realigned US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection (farther west of the existing intersection under Alternative B because of right-of-way considerations). Alternative E (Skywalk) utilizes No Build forecasts because the only proposed changes are pedestrian improvements, which have minimal impact on vehicular volume forecasts.  2020 (No Build) Intersection and Roadway Segment LOS Estimated 2020 (No Build) trips were developed using trip generation rates from the Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition (ITE 2012). A detailed summary of all trip generation rates, reduction factors, and total estimated trips for the proposed local projects is shown in the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization (Stateline) Project – Caltrans Project Report Traffic Operations Analysis Update (Appendix I; Wood Rodgers 2016a). 2020 (No Build) lane geometrics and traffic volume forecasts are shown in Exhibit 3.6-4 and Exhibit 3.6-5, respectively. Intersection Operations 2020 (No Build) intersection traffic operations were quantified using 2020 traffic volumes (Exhibit 3.6-4), which have taken into account planned projects and transportation improvements, and are summarized in Table 3.6-8. Table 3.6-8 2020 (No Build) Intersection Traffic Operations  #  Intersection  Control Type  Annual Average Peak Hour  Summer Peak Hour  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  1  Park Avenue/Pine Boulevard  TWSC1  10.1  B  10.6  B  2  Pine Boulevard/Stateline Avenue  AWSC2  8.3  A  8.7  A  3  US 50/Pioneer Trail  Signal2   18.9  B   45.1  D  4  US 50/Park Avenue/Heavenly Village Way  Signal   13.3  B   39.4  D  5  US 50/Friday Avenue  Signal   5.1  A   9.4  A  6  US 50/Stateline Avenue  Signal   27.9  C   56.9  E*  7  US 50/Lake Parkway  Signal   18.1  B   22.7  C  8  Lake Parkway/Heavenly Village Way  AWSC2  10.7  B  13.0  B  9  Lake Parkway/Harrah’s Road  TWSC1  14.5  B  17.5  C  Notes: AWSC = all-way stop-controlled; LOS = level of service; MUTCD = Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices; S/V = seconds per vehicle; TWSC = two-way stop-controlled. *Projected to operate at LOS E for less than 4 hours per day based on analysis of fifth highest hour, which is considered acceptable in accordance with TRPA standards. 1 “Worst case” delays are indicated for two-way stop-controlled (TWSC) intersections. 2 “Average” control delays (in seconds/vehicle [S/V]) are indicated for signal-controlled and all-way stop-controlled (AWSC) intersections. Source: Wood Rodgers 2016a  As shown in Table 3.6-8, all study area intersections are projected to operate at acceptable annual average and summer peak-hour LOS under 2020 No Build conditions.     Exhibit 3.6-4 2020 (No Build) Lane Geometrics     Exhibit 3.6-5 2020 (No Build) Traffic Volumes   Roadway Segment Operations Table 3.6-9 shows peak-hour arterial/highway directional segment operations under 2020 No Build traffic conditions.  Table 3.6-9 2020 (No Build) Arterial/Highway Segment Traffic Operations  Arterial Segment  Arterial Class1  Direction  Annual Average Peak Hour  Summer Peak Hour  Speed2 (mph)  LOS  Speed2 (mph)  LOS  US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Lake Parkway  III  EB  20.1  C  17.3  D  US 50 through Pioneer Trail and Lake Parkway  III  WB  20.2  C  13.3  E*  Notes: EB = eastbound; LOS = level of service; WB = westbound. *Projected to operate at LOS “E” for less than 4 hours per day based on analysis of 5th highest hour, which is considered acceptable per TRPA standards. 1 With a free flow speed of approximately 35 mph for US 50, the study area roadway segments are regarded as an HCM-2010 Class III Arterial. 2 Average travel speed in miles per hour. Source: Wood Rodgers 2016a   As shown in Table 3.6-9, all study area arterial/highway segments are projected to operate at acceptable annual average and summer peak-hour LOS under 2020 No Build conditions.  2040 (No Build) Traffic Forecasts Estimated 2040 traffic forecasts were calculated by estimating trips that would be generated by local projects that are expected to be completed between 2020 and 2040 and distributing/adding those trips onto the 2020 No Build forecasts. Additionally, it was assumed that traffic on US 50 in the Stateline area would grow at a rate of up to approximately 0.5 percent per year, based on projections from the US 50 Transportation Concept Report and Corridor System Management Plan (Caltrans 2014a) and is consistent with the TRPA travel demand model. Additional growth in through traffic was assumed on top of the local growth as necessary to achieve an overall growth rate of approximately 0.5 percent per year on US 50 in the study area. Projects likely to be completed by 2040 were identified based on discussions with local business owners and TRPA staff, knowledge of the study area, and projects included in the TRPA travel demand model. In addition to the recently approved development projects considered to be completed under 2020 conditions, the following long-term projects were considered completed under 2040 conditions:  Gondola Vista: 22 townhouse units in 10 duplex buildings  Chateau/Zalanta development (full buildout): up to an additional 287 hotel rooms, 20,000 square feet of retail, and 60 recreational condominiums More information about these future improvements is provided in Appendix I (Wood Rodgers 2016a). 2040 (No Build) Intersection and Roadway Segment LOS Estimated 2040 project trips were calculated using trip generation rates from the Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition (ITE 2012).

All remaining study area arterial segments are projected to operate at annual average and summer peak-hour LOS E for less than four hours per day or better under Year 2040 No Build volumes and existing capacity configurations.  2040 (Design Year) Traffic Forecasts Under Alternatives B, C, and D, some existing residences and businesses would be acquired and removed to provide right-of-way for the proposed new alignment of US 50. Three sites have been identified that could be developed with a mixture of multi-family residential, including for replacement housing, and commercial land uses to replace the residences and businesses removed. All three proposed mixed-use development sites combined could contain up to approximately 150 more housing units and 40,000 square feet more of commercial area than would be removed.  The 2040 (Design Year) analysis includes the mixed-use component, including replacement housing. This scenario considers the traffic impacts of the proposed mixed-use development, assuming all three sites are built to accommodate the maximum size and density allowed by current City of South Lake Tahoe land use and zoning ordinances and TRPA thresholds (Exhibits 3.6-7 through 3.6-9).  Methodology Trip generation rates from the Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition (ITE 2012) were used to estimate trips generated by the mixed-use development. Trips generated by the land uses to be removed were subtracted from the trips generated by the mixed-use development to calculate net new trips generated by the mixed-use development. It was determined that the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would generate approximately 1,400–1,700 net new trips per day.  Net new trips generated by the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, were assigned to the scenario with the highest traffic volumes (i.e., 2040 with project conditions) under Alternatives B, C, and D to generate estimates for 2040 with project and mixed-use development including replacement housing.  SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA NEPA Criteria An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the locally preferred action. Under NEPA, the significance of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and intensity of its effects are encompassed by the TRPA and CEQA criteria used for this analysis. The 20-year minimum acceptable LOS for US 50 through the study area is LOS D for NDOT facilities and LOS E for no more than four hours per day for Caltrans and local agency facilities. TRPA Criteria The “Transportation/Circulation” criteria from the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist for Determination of Environmental Impact (TRPA 2014) were used to evaluate the transportation impacts of the alternatives for TRPA compliance. The project would result in a significant impact if it would result in:  generation of 100 or more new DVTE during operation;  changes to existing parking facilities, or demand for new parking;  substantial impact on existing transportation systems, including highway, transit, bicycle, or pedestrian facilities;  alteration of present patterns of circulation or movement of people and/or goods;  alteration of waterborne, rail, or air traffic; or  increased traffic hazards to motor vehicles, bicyclists, or pedestrians.     Exhibit 3.6-7 2040 Alternative B (Triangle) New Development Only Traffic Volumes     Exhibit 3.6-8 2040 Alternative C (Triangle One-way)  New Development Only Traffic Volumes    Exhibit 3.6-9 2040 Alternative D (PSR) New Development Only Traffic Volumes   For study area facilities that fall under local agency jurisdiction, TRPA-defined LOS D is used as the minimum acceptable threshold for operations; however, peak-hour LOS E is regarded as acceptable if the duration of such operations does not exceed four hours per day. TRPA vehicle LOS standards may be exceeded when provisions for multi-modal amenities and/or services (such as transit, bicycling, and walking facilities) are adequate to provide mobility for users at a level that is proportional to the project-generated traffic in relation to overall traffic conditions on affected roadways. Vehicle miles traveled (VMT) are the miles traveled by vehicles within a specific region over a certain period. VMT per capita is defined as total VMT in a region divided by the total population of the region. Total VMT and VMT per capita are both measures of efficiency of the transportation system. As stated above, TRPA has a total VMT standard of reducing overall VMT within the Region to at least 10 percent below 1981 levels. Achievement of the VMT standard is addressed in the 2012 Regional Plan Update through a combination of transportation improvements and land use policies that incentivize redevelopment in urban centers and mixes of urban uses that help reduce VMT. Total VMT has been analyzed for the Regional Plan in Impact 3.3-3 of its EIS. The 2012 Regional Plan Update EIS concluded a less-than-significant effect on total regional VMT after implementation of land use and transportation policies, along with Mitigation Measure 3.3-3, Implement Additional VMT Reduction (TRPA 2012a). Therefore, a project that would be consistent with the Regional Plan, would not have an adverse effect on regional VMT. If a project results in a net decrease in regional VMT or VMT per capita, it is regarded as having a beneficial effect helping attain the mobility and air quality goals for the Region.  CEQA Criteria Based on the Appendix G Environmental Checklist of the State CEQA Guidelines, an alternative would have a significant impact on traffic and transportation if it would:  conflict with an applicable plan, ordinance or policy establishing measures of effectiveness for the performance of the circulation system, taking into account all modes of transportation including mass transit and non-motorized travel and relevant components of the circulation system, including but not limited to intersections, streets, highways and freeways, pedestrian and bicycle paths, and mass transit;  conflict with an applicable congestion management program, including, but not limited to, LOS standards and travel demand measures, or other standards established by the county congestion management agency for designated roads or highways;  result in a change in air traffic patterns, including either an increase in traffic levels or a change in location that results in substantial safety risks;  substantially increase hazards because of a design feature (e.g., sharp curves or dangerous intersections) or incompatible uses (e.g., farm equipment);  result in inadequate emergency access; or  conflict with adopted policies, plans, or programs regarding public transit, bicycle, or pedestrian facilities, or otherwise decrease the performance or safety of such facilities.   ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF THE PROJECT ALTERNATIVES  Impact 3.6-1: Impacts on intersection operations related to the redevelopment of the mixed-use development sites to accommodate replacement housing (Before Opening Day) Redevelopment of the mixed-use development sites to accommodate displaced residents would not affect intersection operations on the existing roadway network. For Alternatives B, C, and D, TTD would construct replacement housing and relocate residents before initiating construction of the transportation improvements in California. This analysis focuses on Site 3, because redevelopment of Site 1 before the transportation improvements is not feasible given its location on existing US 50, and Site 2 is located at the edge of the existing Rocky Point neighborhood and would displace businesses that generate similar traffic volumes where the impact on existing intersection operations is expected to be minimal. The Site 3 redevelopment potential would be the same under all three alternatives. Modeled intersections operations would remain at acceptable levels for Alternatives B, C, and D. Alternatives A and E would not displace residents and would not include any residential displacement or redevelopment. Intersection operations under Alternatives A and E would remain unchanged.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, and D would avoid or minimize the impacts on intersection operations such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; No Impact for Alternatives A and E CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations: Less Than Significant for Alternative B, C, and D; No Impact for Alternatives A and E Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Under Alternative A the no-build condition, existing residents within the Rocky Point neighborhood would not be displaced. They would remain in their existing homes, and the mixed-use development sites would not be redeveloped. Table 3.6-12 below shows that under Alternative A the analyzed intersections would all continue to operate at acceptable LOS within the existing roadway network. Because operations at all modeled intersections would be unchanged, Alternative A would result in no impact to intersection operations for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA and TRPA.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements This impact discussion contemplates short-term adverse impacts resulting from the redevelopment of the mixed-use development sites to accommodate replacement housing before completion of the right-of-way acquisition and transportation improvements in California. This analysis focuses on Site 3, because redevelopment of Site 1 before the transportation improvements is not feasible given its location on existing US 50, and Site 2 is located at the edge of the existing Rocky Point neighborhood and would displace businesses that generate similar traffic volumes where the impact on existing intersection operations is expected to be minimal. For Site 3, Table 3.6-12 compares shows how the three modeled intersections near the Rocky Point neighborhood would operate with redevelopment of Site 3 to accommodate displaced residents, with the existing roadway network and with the proposed transportation improvements. As shown in the last column of Table 3.6-12, with Alternative B the analyzed intersections would all continue to operate at acceptable LOS with the proposed transportation improvements. Notably the delay at each of the modeled intersections would be reduced, and the LOS improved with implementation of the proposed transportation improvements. For the reasons stated above, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  For the purposes of NEPA, the Alternative B transportation improvements would avoid or minimize impacts on intersection operations under this scenario such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing TTD has committed to constructing replacement housing for displaced residents associated with Alternative B before initiating right-of-way acquisition and constructing transportation improvements in California. For the reasons described above, this analysis focuses on the impacts of redevelopment of Site 3 if it were to be constructed before 2020. The trip generation at Site 3 is evaluated for a period leading up to opening day—a time when Site 3 is developed on the existing roadway network—and before completion of the transportation improvements. Table 3.6-12 shows that study intersections would continue to operate at acceptable LOS with the existing roadway network and the development at Site 3 and prior to completion of the transportation improvements. Thus, because intersection operations would remain at an acceptable LOS for studied intersections, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  For the purposes of NEPA, with Alternative B, the redevelopment of one or more of the mixed-use development sites on the existing roadway network would avoid or minimize impacts on intersection operations under this scenario such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the mixed-use development sites could result in similar impacts on intersection operations as described above. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential for short-term intersection operational impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and redevelopment of one or more of the redevelopment sites to include replacement housing would result in a less-than-significant impact on intersection operations on the existing roadway network. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and redevelopment of one or more of the mixed-use development sites to include replacement housing with Alternative B would minimize the impacts on intersection operations on the existing roadway network such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements This impact discussion contemplates short-term adverse impacts resulting from the redevelopment of the mixed-use development sites to accommodate replacement housing before completion of the right-of-way acquisition and transportation improvements in California.

Thus, because intersection operations would remain at an acceptable LOS for studied intersections, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  Table 3.6-12 Intersection Traffic Operations with Replacement Housing Constructed at Site 3  No.  Intersection  Alternatives A and E Current Location in Rocky Point Neighborhood with Existing Roadway Network (Before Opening Day)  Alternatives B, C, and D Relocated Residents at Site 3 Under Existing Roadway Network (Before Opening Day)  Alternatives B, C, and D Relocated Residents at Site 3 with Proposed Transportation Improvements (Opening Day)  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  3  US 50/Pioneer Trail  45.1  D  45.6  D  22.5  C  4  US 50/Park Avenue-Heavenly Village  39.4  D  39.4  D  22.7  C  8  Lake Parkway/Heavenly Village Way  13.0  C  13.0  B  10.5  B  Notes: LOS = level of service; S/V = seconds per vehicle. Source: Wood Rodgers 2016c   For the purposes of NEPA, with Alternative D, the redevelopment of one or more of the mixed-use development sites on the existing roadway network would avoid or minimize impacts on intersection operations under this scenario such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the mixed-use development sites could result in similar impacts on intersection operations as described above. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential for short-term intersection operational impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and redevelopment of one or more of the mixed-use development sites to include replacement housing would result in a less-than-significant impact on intersection operations on the existing roadway network. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and redevelopment of one or more of the mixed-use development sites to include replacement housing with Alternative D would minimize the impacts on intersection operations on the existing roadway network such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E would not include right-of-way acquisition or displace any residents in the Rocky Point neighborhood, nor would it include redevelopment of mixed-use development. Similar to Alternative A, under Alternative E the modeled intersections would remain unchanged. For this reason, Alternative E would result in no impact to intersection operations for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA and TRPA. Impact 3.6-2: Impacts of transportation improvements on intersection operations – 2020 (Opening Day) The US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project would not generate additional 2020 (opening day) vehicle trips that could affect intersection operations; rather, it would implement improvements to existing transportation infrastructure and change circulation patterns within the study area. For Alternatives B, C, and D, US 50 would be realigned to connect to and approximately follow the existing Lake Parkway East alignment. Under Alternatives A and E, the existing US 50 roadway alignment would remain the same as existing conditions. Under Alternative E, LOS intersection operations would remain at acceptable levels in 2020 and LOS at the intersection of Old US 50/Stateline Avenue would improve substantially. Under Alternatives B and D, LOS would improve at several intersections compared to existing conditions. All intersections would operate at acceptable LOS under Alternative A. The implementation of Alternative C would result in unacceptable intersection LOS at the new US 50/Pioneer Trail/Old US 50, Old US 50/Park Avenue/Heavenly Village Way, and new US 50/Lake Parkway/Old US 50 (roundabout option) intersections during summer peak-hour conditions. Exhibits 3.6-10 through 3.6-18 show the lane geometry and study area volumes associated with each of the project alternatives. Because redevelopment of one or more of the mixed-use development sites would not generate new trips as it would provide replacement housing for displaced residents and the remaining site(s) would be constructed between 2020 and 2040, the Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development sites were not analyzed under this 2020 (opening day) scenario. NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives A, B, D, and E would avoid or minimize the impacts on intersection operations in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; Mitigation Measure 3.6-2 has been incorporated into Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to impacts on intersection operations in 2020.  CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations: Beneficial for Alternatives B, D, and E; Less Than Significant for Alternative A; Less Than Significant for Alternative C after implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.6-2 Alternative A: No Build (No Project) As shown in Table 3.6-13, all Alternative A intersections are projected to operate acceptable levels in 2020. Because all intersections would operate at acceptable LOS under 2020 conditions, Alternative A would have a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative A would avoid or minimize the impacts on intersection operations in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Exhibit 3.6-12 shows the study area intersection volumes associated with Alternative B transportation improvements on opening day. As shown in Table 3.6-13, all study area intersections are projected to operate at annual average and summer peak-hour LOS C or better under opening day conditions. Alternative B is projected to improve LOS compared to Alternative A at the following intersections during summer and/or annual average peak-hour conditions:  Park Avenue/Pine Boulevard;  New US 50/Pioneer Trail/Old US 50 (both roadway geometry options);   Old US 50/Park Avenue/Heavenly Village Way (both roadway geometry options);  Old US 50/Stateline Avenue;  New US 50/Lake Parkway/Old US 50 (signal and roundabout options); and  New US 50/Heavenly Village Way. Thus, because intersection operations would remain at acceptable LOS for all study area intersections and would improve for the intersections listed above, implementation of transportation improvements included in Alternative B on opening day would result in a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the impacts on intersection operations in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Because redevelopment of one or more of the three mixed-use development sites would not generate new trips as it would provide replacement housing for displaced residents and the remaining site(s) would be constructed between 2020 and 2040, this condition is not analyzed under the 2020 (opening day) scenario. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Exhibit 3.6-14 shows the study area intersection volumes associated with Alternative C transportation improvements on opening day. As shown in Table 3.6-13, two study area intersections are projected to operate at unacceptable LOS during opening day peak-hour operations:  New US 50/Pioneer Trail/existing US 50;   New US 50/Lake Parkway/existing US 50 (signal option);  New US 50/Lake Parkway/existing US 50 (roundabout option). The heavy left-turn movements for the eastbound approach of the new US 50/Pioneer Trail/existing US 50 intersection are the primary cause of the LOS degradation at this intersection. The LOS of the signalized new US 50/Lake Parkway/Old US 50 intersection degrades to LOS F primarily due to the high volume of left-turn movements of the westbound approach. The new US 50/Lake Parkway/Old US 50 roundabout option fails (LOS F) due to the high volume of circulating left turns that would be made from westbound US 50 onto the new US 50 Loop. For these reasons, in the development of the alternatives, the Project Development Team (PDT) dismissed a roundabout as an option at new US 50/Lake Parkway/Old US 50 for Alternative C.  Thus, because of LOS intersection operations exceeding acceptable levels at the intersections detailed above, implementation of Alternative C transportation improvements on opening day would result in a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to unacceptable LOS during opening day peak-hour operations. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Because redevelopment of one or more of the three mixed-use development sites would not generate new trips as it would provide replacement housing for displaced residents and the remaining site(s) would be constructed between 2020 and 2040, this condition is not analyzed under the 2020 (opening day) scenario. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements  Exhibit 3.6-16 shows the study area intersection volumes associated with Alternative D transportation improvements on opening day. As shown in Table 3.6-13, all Alternative D study area intersections are projected to operate at annual average and summer peak-hour LOS C or better under opening day conditions. This alternative is projected to reduce delay compared to Alternative A at the following intersections during summer and/or annual average peak-hour conditions:  Park Avenue/Pine Boulevard;  New US 50/Pioneer Trail/Old US 50;   Old US 50/Park Avenue/Heavenly Village Way;   Old US 50/Stateline Avenue;  New US 50/Lake Parkway/Old US 50 (signal and roundabout options); and  New US 50/Heavenly Village Way. Thus, because operations would be at acceptable LOS for all study area intersections and would improve for the intersections listed above, implementation of transportation improvements included in Alternative D on opening day would result in a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the impacts on intersection operations in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Because redevelopment of one or more of the three mixed-use development sites would not generate new trips as it would provide replacement housing for displaced residents and the remaining site(s) would be constructed between 2020 and 2040, this condition is not analyzed under the 2020 (opening day) scenario. Alternative E: Skywalk Exhibit 3.6-18 shows the study area intersection volumes associated with Alternative E on opening day. As shown in Table 3.6-13, all Alternative E study area intersections are projected to operate at annual average and summer peak-hour LOS D or better under opening day conditions. Under Alternative E, several intersections would experience substantial LOS improvements; most notably, the US 50/Stateline Avenue intersection would improve from LOS E for up to 4 hours per day under Alternative A during the summer peak hour to LOS B: Alternative E is projected to reduce delay compared to Alternative A at the following intersections during summer and/or annual average peak-hour conditions:  US 50/Park Avenue/Heavenly Village Way;  US 50/Stateline Avenue; and  US 50/Heavenly Village Way. Thus, because all study area intersections would operate at acceptable LOS and LOS at several intersections would improve, implementation of Alternative E on opening day would result in a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize the impacts on intersection operations – 2020 (opening day) such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Table 3.6-13 2020 (Opening Day) Intersection Traffic Operations  #  Intersection  Control Type  Alternative A (No Build)  Alternative B (Triangle)  Alternative C (Triangle One-Way)  Alternative D (PSR Alt 2)  Alternative E (Skywalk)  Annual Avg  Summer Pk  Annual Avg  Summer Pk  Annual Avg  Summer Pk  Annual Avg  Summer Pk  Annual Avg  Summer Pk  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  1  Park Avenue/Pine Boulevard  TWSC1  10.1  B  10.6  B  9.5  A  9.8  A  9.6  A  10.0  B  9.5  A  9.8  A  10.1  B  10.6  B  2  Pine Boulevard/Stateline Avenue  AWSC2  8.3  A  8.7  A  8.3  A  8.7  A  8.5  A  8.9  A  8.3  A  8.7  A  8.3  A  8.7  A  3  New US 50/Pioneer Trail/Old US 503  Signal A   18.9  B   46.1  D   19.9  B   24.5  C   60.1  E*   99.2  F   19.8  B   22.4  C   20.0  C   46.1  D  Signal B  -  -  -  -   20.5  C   23.6  C  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  4  Old US 50/Park Avenue/Heavenly Village Way4  Signal A   13.3  B   39.4  D   17.4  B   21.2  C  13.6  B  16.7  B   18.1  B   22.2  C   17.2  B   31.9  C  Signal B  -  -  -  -   21.2  C   27.7  C  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  Old US 50/Friday Avenue  Signal2   5.1  A   9.4  A   9.1  A   10.0  A  3.9  A  16.3  B   7.7  A   9.9  A   5.0  A   6.9  A  6  Old US 50/Stateline Avenue  Signal   27.9  C   56.9  E*   16.1  B   22.4  C  7.0  A   54.5  D   16.7  B   20.5  C   8.6  A   11.2  B  7  New US 50/Lake Parkway/Old US 505  Signal   18.1  B   22.7  C   16.3  B   20.0  B  40.5  D   82.4  F   16.1  B   19.8  B   16.3  B   25.7  C  Rndabt6,7,10  -  -  -  -  7.4 (13.9)  A (B)  7.9 (15.5)  A (C)  21.5 (41.7)  C  104.4 (219.6)  F (F)  7.4 (13.9)  A (B)  7.9 (15.5)  A (C)  -  -  -  -  8  New US 50/Heavenly Village Way  Signal (AWSC8)  14.5  B  17.5  C   8.9  A   11.1  B   4.4  A  5.1  A   9.3  A   10.3  B  10.7  B  13.0  B  9  New US 50/Harrah’s Road  Signal (TWSC9)   5.1  A   9.4  A   4.3  A   4.8  A   1.6  A   4.9  A   4.4  A   4.9  A  14.5  B  17.5  C  Notes: AWSC = all-way stop-controlled; EB = eastbound; LOS = level of service; SB = southbound; S/V = seconds per vehicle; TWSC = two-way stop-controlled.

Alternative E would actually improve roadway segment LOS for both roadway study segments during summer peak conditions. However, with Alternative C, three roadway segments within the study area (eastbound and westbound existing US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Park Avenue and one-way eastbound US 50 between Park Avenue and Lake Parkway) would be reduced to unacceptable roadway segment LOS. LOS segment operations would remain at acceptable levels for all study area arterial segments with Alternative A. Because redevelopment of one or more of the mixed-use redevelopment sites would not generate new trips as it would provide replacement housing for displaced residents and the remaining site(s) would be constructed between 2020 and 2040, the Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development sites were not analyzed under this 2020 (opening day) scenario. NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives A, B, D, and E would avoid or minimize the impacts on roadway segment operations in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; Mitigation Measure 3.6-3 has been incorporated into Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the impacts on roadway segment operations in 2020. CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Beneficial for Alternative E; Less Than Significant for Alternative A and for Alternatives B and D; Significant and Unavoidable for Alternative C after implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.6-3 Project-generated traffic volumes were added to 2020 (No Build) traffic volumes along the study segments to obtain LOS estimates for road segment operations under 2020 (opening day) with project conditions. Table 3.6-14 shows the peak-hour arterial/highway directional segment operations under 2020 with project conditions for all project alternatives.  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) As shown in Table 3.6-14, all study area arterial segments under Alternative A are projected to operate at LOS E for less than 4 hours per day or better during the annual average and summer peak under opening day conditions. Thus, because LOS segment operations would remain at acceptable levels for all study area arterial segments, implementation of Alternative A would result in a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative A would avoid or minimize the impacts on roadway segment operations in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements As shown in Table 3.6-14, all study area arterial segments after implementation of Alternative B transportation improvements are projected to operate at annual average and summer peak-hour LOS D or better under opening day conditions.

The opportunity for community revitalization would be a source of reduced VMT, because visitor uses could be concentrated in a compact, pedestrian/bicycle/transit-served urban core, decreasing the need to take vehicle trips to reach some tourism destinations (e.g., hotel to restaurant or entertainment venue trip, retail shopping trips). The realignment, itself, would cause a small, localized increase in VMT for through traffic with Alternatives B, C, and D, because the route of US 50 would be slightly longer around the tourist core than through it; however, its mobility enhancements and support of planned development in an urban center would be consistent with attaining the regional total VMT threshold (as required by the Lake Tahoe Regional Plan and evaluated in the Regional Plan Update EIS). The realignment of US 50, would remain consistent with the VMT per capita goal of RTP/SCS EIR/EIS Alternative 3 and would support achievement of the Regional Plan VMT requirements, so the beneficial impact of the RTP on regional VMT would be sustained. Alternative A would affect VMT because it would not support revitalization of the tourist core and would retain the same length of US 50 in the corridor. For Alternative E, the existing roadway alignment would remain the same with separation of pedestrians on an elevated structure. It would not support revitalization in the tourist core as effectively as the realignment alternatives and the through-traffic trip length on US 50 would be unchanged. Because redevelopment of one or more of the three mixed-use development sites would not generate new trips as it would provide replacement housing for displaced residents and the remaining site(s) would be constructed between 2020 and 2040, the Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development sites are not analyzed under the 2020 (opening day) scenario. NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives A, B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the impacts on VMT in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Beneficial for Alternatives B, C, and D; Less Than Significant for Alternatives A and E VMT is a measure of the efficiency of the transportation system and its level of integration with planned land use patterns. For the Tahoe Region, VMT may be influenced by variables such as land use location, emphasis on personal motor vehicle travel modes compared to other modes (such as walking, cycling, or transit), walking and bicycling opportunities in compact urban centers, and implementation of vehicle trip reduction strategies. Environmental consequences are indirectly related to a change in the volume or efficiency of VMT. Motor vehicle travel involves air pollutant emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, and noise generation; therefore, VMT increases result in indirect environmental impacts related to air pollutant, GHG, and noise emissions.  The US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project is a part of several transportation strategy packages and alternatives proposed and analyzed in the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS (TMPO and TRPA 2012a). Alternative 3 of the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS was selected and approved by the TRPA Governing Board as the alternative that would best achieve TRPA’s regional transportation objectives. The RTP/SCS EIR/EIS Alternative 3 involved construction of various transportation improvement projects, including the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project, as well as reduced development in the Region, plus highly incentivized redevelopment in Town Centers, Regional Center, and the High Density Tourist District. The RTP/SCS EIR/EIS found that Alternative 3 would have a beneficial impact on VMT, because it would cause VMT per capita to decrease from 36.4 in 2010 to 35.3 in 2035, a 3.1 percent reduction. The RTP/SCS Final EIR/EIS addresses VMT issues in Master Response 11 (TMPO and TRPA 2012b:3-57 to 3-61). Realignment of US 50 to create the opportunity for community revitalization in the Stateline/South Lake Tahoe tourist core is also consistent with the Lake Tahoe Regional Plan, including its attainment of the regional VMT threshold of total VMT that is at least 10 percent below 1981 levels. The Lake Tahoe Regional Plan Update EIS (RPU EIS) addresses the VMT issue in Impact 3.3-3 and includes adoption of Mitigation Measure 3.3-3, Implement Additional VMT Reduction, to achieve a less-than-significant impact outcome (TRPA 2012a).  Because the project is included in and consistent with RTP Alternative 3, which was shown to reduce VMT per capita during environmental review of the RTP, the regional VMT quantitative projections prepared for the RTP are applicable to this project. A separate quantitative analysis is not needed for this EIR/EIS/EIS, because the project would be consistent with RTP Alternative 3. Instead, a qualitative analysis was prepared based on the following information:  Alternatives B, C, and D would implement the realignment of US 50 around the tourist core to provide the opportunity for community revitalization, consistent with the approved RTP. One of the intended outcomes of the revitalization of the tourist core addressed in the RTP would be a compact, mixed-use, urban center with strong walking, bicycling, and transit connections to reduce the need to use motor vehicles for trips that would begin and end in or near the tourist core. For instance, trips between a hotel and a restaurant, for retail shopping, and to reach entertainment venues could be accomplished without using personal vehicles. This urban center concept is one of the foundations of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project’s contribution to reduced regional VMT, which was the conclusion of the RTP’s regional VMT modeling analysis.   Alternatives B, C, and D would result in lengthening the localized trip distance for through trips in the Stateline area for both eastbound and westbound traffic, because the distance around the tourist core is slightly longer than through the center of the core area (i.e., about 0.4 miles longer). This increase in route length would require vehicles on US 50 to travel a longer distance through the Stateline area, which would lead to a small increase in regional VMT. This localized increase was also incorporated into the regional VMT modeling when the RTP was reviewed and determined to result in beneficial future VMT reductions.  A significant number of induced trips would not occur as a result of improved levels of service, because the project only involves a little over 1 mile of travel corridor and the difference in travel time would not be sufficient for motorists to decide that more trips should be taken. Also, regional induced trips would not occur, recognizing that the capacity of the overall highway system would not be changed as a result of the project, because the number of lanes and the intersection configurations on US 50 east and west of the project vicinity would be unchanged. Based on this assessment, it is reasonable to conclude that the 2020 (opening day) condition for Alternatives A and E would result in a less-than-significant change to the existing VMT; Alternatives B, C, and D would result in a VMT benefit, because of consistency with the RTP (TMPO and TRPA 2012a:3.3-50). Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Alternative A assumes that the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project, which is included in RTP/SCS EIR/EIS Alternative 3, would not be constructed. Therefore, the community revitalization opportunity of the highway realignment would not be realized, including the reduction of VMT made possible by revitalization of a more walkable, bikable, and transit-served urban center. Because RTP/SCS EIR/EIS Alternative 3 was determined to have a beneficial impact on VMT based on such reduction of trips, Alternative A would not substantially change VMT nor contribute toward the Region reaching its goal of reducing VMT below 1981 levels. Thus, Alternative A in 2020 would have an adverse and less-than-significant impact on VMT for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative A would avoid or minimize impacts on VMT in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Alternative B transportation improvements would implement the realignment of US 50 around the tourist core, providing the opportunity for community revitalization that is consistent with the approved RTP. One of the intended outcomes of the revitalization of the tourist core addressed in the RTP would be a compact, mixed-use, urban center with strong walking, bicycling, and transit connections to reduce the need to use motor vehicles for trips that would begin and end in or near the tourist core. This would be accomplished by the close proximity of mixed, visitor-serving facilities in the tourist core area, the interconnections of pedestrian paths and bicycle facilities, and access to enhanced transit facilities. For instance, trips between a hotel and a restaurant, for retail shopping, and to reach entertainment venues could be accomplished without using personal vehicles. This urban center concept is one of the foundations of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project’s contribution to reduced regional VMT, which was the conclusion of the RTP’s regional VMT modeling analysis.  Because US 50 would be aligned around the tourist core area, the length for through trips on US 50 in the Stateline area for both eastbound and westbound traffic would increase by approximately 0.4 mile. This increase in roadway length would require vehicles on US 50 to travel a longer distance through the Stateline area, which would lead to a small increase in local VMT. This increased through trip length was considered during the VMT modeling for the RTP, and is accounted for in the determination of a beneficial reduction in per capita VMT for the approved RTP. While the highway realignment in Alternative B would result in a small increase in VMT when through trips are analyzed on their own, it is consistent with the community revitalization objectives of the approved RTP Alternative 3, which results in a beneficial reduction in regional VMT. Because RTP/SCS EIR/EIS Alternative 3 was determined to have a beneficial impact on VMT, implementation of Alternative B would support the Region’s pursuit of its goal of reducing VMT below 1981 levels. Thus, implementation of transportation improvements included in Alternative B on opening day would have a beneficial impact on VMT for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize impacts on VMT in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Because redevelopment of one or more of the three mixed-use development sites would not generate new trips as it would provide replacement housing for displaced residents and the remaining site(s) would be constructed between 2020 and 2040, this condition is not analyzed under the 2020 (opening day) scenario. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements As described for Alternative B, the RTP implementation includes a version of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project (Alternative 3) similar to this Alternative C. One of the intended outcomes of the revitalization of the tourist core addressed in the RTP would be a compact, mixed-use, urban center with strong walking, bicycling, and transit connections to reduce the need to use motor vehicles for trips that would begin and end in or near the tourist core. This would be accomplished by the close proximity of mixed, visitor-serving facilities in the tourist core area, the interconnections of pedestrian paths and bicycle facilities, and access to enhanced transit facilities. Thus, implementation of transportation improvements included in Alternative C would support the RTP’s beneficial impact on VMT for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize impacts on VMT in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Because redevelopment of one or more of the mixed-use development sites would not generate new trips as it would provide replacement housing for displaced residents and the remaining site(s) would be constructed between 2020 and 2040, this condition is not analyzed under the 2020 (opening day) scenario. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements As described for Alternative B, the RTP implementation includes a version of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project (Alternative 3) similar to this Alternative D. One of the intended outcomes of the revitalization of the tourist core addressed in the RTP would be a compact, mixed-use, urban center with strong walking, bicycling, and transit connections to reduce the need to use motor vehicles for trips that would begin and end in or near the tourist core. This would be accomplished by the close proximity of mixed, visitor-serving facilities in the tourist core area, the interconnections of pedestrian paths and bicycle facilities, and access to enhanced transit facilities. Thus, implementation of transportation improvements included in Alternative D would support the RTP’s beneficial impact on VMT for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize impacts on VMT in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Because redevelopment of one or more of the three mixed-use development sites would not generate new trips as it would provide replacement housing for displaced residents and the remaining site(s) would be constructed between 2020 and 2040, this condition is not analyzed under the 2020 (opening day) scenario.  Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E would result only in pedestrian improvements on the deck above US 50. Alternative E assumes that a realigned US 50, which is included in RTP/SCS EIR/EIS Alternative 3, would not be constructed. Therefore, the community revitalization opportunity of the highway realignment would not be realized as effectively as one of the realignment alternatives, including the reduction of VMT made possible by revitalization of a more walkable, bikable, and transit-served urban center. Because RTP/SCS EIR/EIS Alternative 3 was determined to have a beneficial impact on VMT based on such reduction of trips from the community revitalization component, which would not be realized as effectively for Alternative E, it would not substantially change VMT nor contribute toward the Region reaching its goal of reducing VMT below 1981 levels. Thus, Alternative E in 2020 would have a less-than-significant impact on VMT for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features Alternative E would avoid or minimize impacts on VMT in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Impact 3.6-5: Impacts on bicycle and pedestrian facilities – 2020 (Opening Day) Because of their design, Alternatives B, C, D, and E would not disrupt or interfere with existing or planned bicycle/pedestrian facilities; rather, they would enhance the existing infrastructure and create a bicycle and pedestrian network with enhanced connectivity. Furthermore, Alternatives B, C, D, and E would not create an inconsistency with any adopted policies related to bicycle or pedestrian systems. No modifications to the existing bicycle or pedestrian infrastructure would occur under Alternative A. Because redevelopment of one or more of the three mixed-use development sites would not generate new trips as it would provide replacement housing for displaced residents, relocated residents would have access to the same pedestrian and bicycle facilities as under existing conditions, and the remaining site(s) would be constructed between 2020 and 2040, the Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development sites were not analyzed under this 2020 (opening day) scenario. NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the impacts on bicycle and pedestrian facilities in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Beneficial for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; No Impact for Alternative A Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Because no modifications to the existing conditions would occur, implementation of Alternative A would result in no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Implementation of transportation improvements for Alternative B under opening day conditions would include minimum 5-foot-wide shoulders/bicycle lanes and minimum 6-foot-wide pedestrian sidewalks along Lake Tahoe Boulevard (existing US 50) for the full length of the study segment. In some sections, the sidewalks could be constructed up to 20 feet wide. The realigned US 50 would include construction of 5-foot-wide bicycle lanes/shoulders, along with 6-foot-wide sidewalks on at least one side of the roadway.  A pedestrian bridge would be constructed over the realigned US 50 near the California/Nevada state line connecting Van Sickle Bi-State Park to the Stateline area. Additionally, a new traffic signal at the Van Sickle Bi-State Park entrance would provide a dedicated pedestrian crossing phase where none exists today.  The Alternative B cycle track option would replace the proposed bicycle lanes described above with a cycle track path along the lake side of existing US 50. The two-way cycle track would be separated from vehicular traffic by a barrier and would connect with the Linear Park that extends from Ski Run Boulevard to the end of the Tahoe Meadows District. This dedicated bike path with barrier separation from vehicular traffic would provide a more desirable bicycle environment along the study segment of US 50, as well as providing connectivity to the existing Class I Bike Path at the west end of the study segment.  Bicycles would be able to navigate the Eastbound US 50/Lake Parkway/Westbound US 50 roundabout with vehicular traffic or use the pedestrian/bicycle crossings that would be provided on all legs of the roundabout. Alternative B includes an option to restripe the lake side of Lake Parkway, resulting in removing existing bike lanes and shoulders. Bicycle traffic would be Class 3 or shared travel lane with vehicular traffic.  Alternative B would improve existing bicycle/pedestrian infrastructure and improve connectivity within the study area. Furthermore, Alternative B would not create an inconsistency with any adopted policies related to bicycle or pedestrian systems. Therefore, the impact of Alternative B transportation improvements on opening day would be beneficial for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize any inconsistencies with adopted policies related to bicycle or pedestrian systems such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Because redevelopment of one or more of the three mixed-use development sites would not generate new trips as it would provide replacement housing for displaced residents, relocated residents would have access to the same pedestrian and bicycle facilities as under existing conditions, and the remaining site(s) would be constructed between 2020 and 2040, this condition is not analyzed under the 2020 (opening day) scenario. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Alternative C would add minimum 5-foot-wide shoulders/bicycle lanes and minimum 6-foot-wide pedestrian sidewalks along eastbound US 50 for the full length of the study segment. In some sections, the sidewalks could be constructed up to 20 feet wide.  Five-foot-wide bicycle lanes/shoulders would be constructed along the new US 50 westbound alignment, along with 6-foot-wide sidewalks on at least one side of the roadway. A pedestrian bridge would be constructed over the new US 50 westbound alignment near the California/Nevada state line connecting Van Sickle Bi-State Park to the Stateline area. A new traffic signal at the Van Sickle Bi-State Park entrance would provide a dedicated pedestrian crossing phase where none exists today. The proposed additions and improvements to the existing pedestrian and bicycle facilities would increase pedestrian and bicycle connectivity throughout the study area. Although Alternative C includes an option to restripe the lake side of Lake Parkway, resulting in removing existing bike lanes, the shoulder would continue to be wide enough for bicycle travel. Alternative C would improve existing bicycle/pedestrian infrastructure and improve connectivity within the study area. Furthermore, Alternative C would not create an inconsistency with any adopted policies related to bicycle or pedestrian systems. Therefore, the impact of Alternative C transportation improvements on opening day would be beneficial for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize any inconsistencies with adopted policies related to bicycle or pedestrian systems such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Because redevelopment of one or more of the three mixed-use development sites would not generate new trips as it would provide replacement housing for displaced residents, relocated residents would have access to the same pedestrian and bicycle facilities as under existing conditions, and the remaining site(s) would be constructed between 2020 and 2040, this condition is not analyzed under the 2020 (opening day) scenario.  Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements Alternative D would add minimum 5-foot-wide shoulders/bicycle lanes and minimum 6-foot-wide pedestrian sidewalks along Lake Tahoe Boulevard (existing US 50) for the full length of the study segment. In some sections, the sidewalks could be constructed up to 20 feet wide.  Five-foot-wide bicycle lanes/shoulders would be constructed along the realigned US 50, along with 6-foot-wide sidewalks on at least one side of the roadway.

Furthermore, Alternative D would not create an inconsistency with any adopted policies related to bicycle or pedestrian systems. Therefore, the impact of Alternative D transportation improvements on opening day would be beneficial for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize any inconsistencies with adopted policies related to bicycle or pedestrian systems such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Because redevelopment of one or more of the three mixed-use development sites would not generate new trips as it would provide replacement housing for displaced residents, relocated residents would have access to the same pedestrian and bicycle facilities as under existing conditions, and the remaining site(s) would be constructed between 2020 and 2040, this condition is not analyzed under the 2020 (opening day) scenario.  Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E would involve construction of a new pedestrian skywalk between the Montbleu Resort and Casino and Stateline Avenue through the resort-casino portion of the tourist core and replace the existing at-grade pedestrian scramble at this location. Furthermore, the project would not create an inconsistency with any adopted policies related to bicycle or pedestrian systems. Thus, implementation of Alternative E would result in a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize any inconsistencies with adopted policies related to bicycle or pedestrian systems such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Impact 3.6-6: Impacts on transit – 2020 (Opening Day) Alternatives B, C, D, and E would not disrupt or interfere with existing transit facilities and would enhance the existing transit infrastructure. Furthermore, the build alternatives would be consistent with adopted policies related to transit systems. No modifications to the existing transit infrastructure would occur under Alternative A. Because Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development would be constructed between 2020 and 2040, this condition is not analyzed under the 2020 (opening day) scenario. However, replacement housing for these alternatives would be constructed at one or more of the three mixed-use development sites prior to implementation of the transportation improvements in California and is analyzed here for the 2020 scenario. Transit demand associated with the replacement housing could shift within the project site, but there would be no net increase in the number of residents in the project site that would result in an increase in demand for transit. NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives A, B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the impacts on transit in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement  CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Beneficial for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; Less Than Significant for Alternative A  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Because no modifications to the existing conditions would occur, implementation of Alternative A would result in no new transit facilities. However, the projected increase in vehicular traffic through the study area would result in LOS degrading. The segment of US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Park Avenue would experience a reduction of speed as result, as shown below:   Eastbound US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Park Avenue – average vehicular speed would degrade as follows:  Annual average peak hour: Reduction from 22.2 mph to 20.1 mph  Westbound US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Park Avenue – average vehicular speed would degrade as follows:  Annual average peak hour: Reduction from 21.6 mph to 20.2 mph The reduction in average mph anticipated with Alternative A would increase travel times along US 50, however, the overall increased travel time would be minimal. Thus, this would result in a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features Alternative A would avoid or minimize the impacts on transit in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Implementation of transportation improvements included in Alternative B would not alter existing transit circulation. Transit operations would be improved as a result of wider shoulders and the potential provision of bus pullouts, resulting in safer bus stop operations. The decreased traffic volumes through the tourist core anticipated under Alternative B would enhance safety and improve transit service by reducing travel times and delays associated with congestion in the area. Alternative B would also include the construction of new bus shelters at bus stop locations where existing features are limited to signs and, in some cases, benches. Alternative B would improve transit service and facilities within the study area. Furthermore, Alternative B would be consistent with adopted policies related to transit systems. Therefore, the impact of Alternative B transportation improvements on transit on opening day would be beneficial for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the impacts on transit in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Because Alternative B mixed-use development would be constructed between 2020 and 2040, this condition is not analyzed under the 2020 (opening day) scenario. However, replacement housing with Alternative B would be constructed at one or more of the three mixed-use development sites prior to implementation of the transportation improvements in California and is analyzed here for the 2020 scenario. Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements.  The replacement housing located at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B for the 2020 scenario would be limited to the number of housing units that would be displaced by the project. Therefore, there would be no net increase in the number of residents in the project site that would result in an increase in demand for transit. Depending on the location of the replacement housing units, it is possible that the demand for transit could shift to different transit stops within the project site. Therefore, Alternative B replacement housing at one or more of the three mixed-use development sites for the 2020 scenario would have a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the replacement housing at Site 3 as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize the impacts on transit in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar impacts on transit in 2020 as described for the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential impacts on transit in 2020 would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a beneficial impact on transit in 2020. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would minimize the impacts on transit in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Implementation of transportation improvements included in Alternative C would reroute westbound transit circulation along the new US 50 alignment. Eastbound transit circulation would remain along existing US 50. Transit operations would be improved through the creation of wider shoulders and the potential provision of bus pullouts, resulting in safer bus stop operations. Alternative C would also include the construction of new bus shelters at bus stop locations where existing features are limited to signs and, in some cases, benches. Alternative C would improve transit infrastructure and safety within the study area. Furthermore, Alternative C would be consistent with adopted policies related to transit systems. Therefore, the impact of Alternative C transportation improvements on opening day would be beneficial for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the impacts on transit in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Because Alternative C mixed-use development would be constructed between 2020 and 2040, this condition is not analyzed under the 2020 (opening day) scenario.

Depending on the location of the housing units, it is possible that the demand for transit could shift to different transit stops within the project site. Therefore, Alternative C replacement housing at the three mixed-use development sites for 2020 would have a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the replacement housing at Site 3 as part of Alternative C would avoid or minimize the impacts on transit in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar impacts on transit in 2020 as described for the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites.

Transit operations would be improved as a result of wider shoulders and the potential provision of bus pullouts, resulting in safer bus stop operations. The decreased traffic volumes through the tourist core anticipated under Alternative D would enhance safety and improve transit service by reducing travel times and delays associated with congestion in the area.

Therefore, Alternative D replacement housing at the three mixed-use development sites for 2020 would have a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would avoid or minimize the impacts on transit in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar impacts on transit in 2020 as described for the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential impacts on transit in 2020 would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents.  Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a beneficial impact on transit in 2020. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would minimize the impacts on transit in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative E: Skywalk Under Alternative E, there would be no changes to transit facilities in the study area; however, the existing pedestrian scramble between the Montbleu Resort and Casino and Hard Rock Hotel and Casino would be replaced by a pedestrian skywalk, resulting in improved safety for pedestrians and vehicles, including transit. Thus, the impact of Alternative E on opening day would be beneficial for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize the impacts on transit in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Impact 3.6-7: Construction-related traffic impacts – 2020 (Opening Day) Construction of the transportation improvements for Alternatives B, C, D, and E would result in construction-related traffic and temporary disruption to traffic circulation in the area of construction. The transportation improvements could be constructed over three construction seasons. In accordance with Caltrans requirements, the construction phase of the project would include a Transportation Management Plan (TMP) that would be implemented during construction operations. The TMP would be completed in coordination with Caltrans, TTD, TRPA, NDOT, City of South Lake Tahoe, and Douglas County. Implementation of the TMP would minimize transportation disruptions during construction. No construction would occur under Alternative A. Lane closures and temporary full closure of US 50 would occur with construction of Alternative E. The replacement housing would be constructed at one or more of the mixed-use development sites prior to construction of transportation improvements. Construction activities for the replacement housing would maintain access to businesses and residences and would conform with City of South Lake Tahoe standards, as applicable. Because construction of mixed-use development at the remaining site(s) would be constructed after 2020, Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development were not analyzed under the 2020 (opening day) scenario. NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the construction-related traffic impacts in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; The design features of Alternative E would minimize the construction-related traffic impacts in 2020, but there are no other feasible mitigation, avoidance, or minimization measures that could further reduce construction-related traffic impacts; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, and D; No Impact for Alternative A; Significant and Unavoidable for Alternative E Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Because no modifications to the existing conditions would occur, implementation of Alternative A would result in no impact regarding construction-related traffic for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Construction of Alternative B transportation improvements is expected to occur over three construction seasons. The first phase would include right-of-way acquisition, building demolition, and utility improvements. The second phase would include construction of the realigned US 50. The last phase would include construction on existing US 50 through the tourist core. Each of these phases is expected to require one construction season. Traffic on affected roadways would either be carried through or detoured onto other roadways. Construction of the roundabout at US 50/Lake Parkway would be phased to allow through access during construction.  In accordance with Caltrans requirements, any project impacting or occurring within the State Highway System requires the preparation of a TMP. Prior to construction activities, a TMP would be developed in coordination with Caltrans, TRPA, the City of South Lake Tahoe, Douglas County, NDOT, and other agencies as appropriate. During the project planning phase, Caltrans would review the project to determine which traffic management strategies would need to be deployed based on project conditions and the anticipated work zone safety and mobility impacts. Implementation of the TMP would minimize traffic flow disruption through the construction work zones and enhance the safety of the work zones for the traveling public and workers, in accordance with Caltrans standards. Because implementation of the TMP would minimize transportation disruptions and maintain safe travel conditions during the construction seasons in accordance with Caltrans standards, impacts would be maintained at a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the construction-related traffic impacts in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing at one or more of the mixed-use development sites (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at one of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements.  Construction of the replacement housing at one or more of the mixed-use development sites for Alternative B could result in construction-related traffic and temporary disruption to traffic circulation in the area of construction. The construction activities would be limited to the mixed-use development site and the construction staging would be located on-site, on right-of-way acquired for the project, or through agreement with a private property owner for use of their land.  Access to businesses and residences would be maintained during construction of the replacement housing. Furthermore, project construction would be scheduled in late spring or early fall, rather than the summer peak tourist season, to reduce effects on businesses, residents, and visitors. All construction activities would be implemented in conformance with City of South Lake Tahoe standards, as applicable. However, specific construction details for the replacement housing are not known at this time. As part of approval and permitting process, the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for Alternative B would be required to undergo project-level environmental review and would be subject to all applicable jurisdictional regulations and permit requirements. Because construction of the replacement housing on one or more of the mixed-use development sites would occur in existing developed areas and would avoid or minimize construction-related traffic impacts, construction-related traffic impacts from Alternative B replacement housing would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the replacement housing at one or more of the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the construction-related traffic impacts in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than one of the mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential for construction-related traffic impacts in 2020 as described for the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential construction-related traffic impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Because Alternative B mixed-use development on the remaining site(s) would be constructed after 2020, the construction-related traffic impacts of this development is not analyzed under the 2020 (opening day) scenario.  Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and replacement housing at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would result in a less-than-significant construction-related traffic impact. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and replacement housing at one or more of the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would minimize the construction-related traffic impacts such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Implementation of Alternative C transportation improvements would result in the same construction-related traffic effects as Alternative B because it would include similar construction elements as described for Alternative B. Implementation of Alternative C transportation improvements on construction-related traffic impacts on opening day would result in a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the construction-related traffic impacts in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses at one or more of the mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements.  Construction of the replacement housing at one or more of the mixed-use development sites for Alternative C could result in construction-related traffic similar to that described above for Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing. As described above for Alternative B, as part of approval and permitting process, the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for Alternative C would be required to undergo project-level environmental review and would be subject to all applicable jurisdictional regulations and permit requirements. Because construction of the replacement housing on one or more of the mixed-use development sites would occur in an existing developed area and would avoid or minimize construction-related traffic impacts, construction-related traffic impacts from Alternative C replacement housing would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the replacement housing at one or more of the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the construction-related traffic impacts in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than one of the mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential for construction-related traffic impacts in 2020 as described for the replacement housing at one of the mixed-use development sites.

Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Because Alternative C mixed-use development on the remaining site(s) would be constructed after 2020, the construction-related traffic impacts of this development is not analyzed under the 2020 (opening day) scenario. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and replacement housing at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would result in a less-than-significant construction-related traffic impact. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and replacement housing at one or more of the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would minimize the construction-related traffic impacts such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements Implementation of Alternative D transportation improvements would result in the same construction-related traffic effects as Alternative B because it would include similar construction elements as described for Alternative B. Implementation of Alternative D transportation improvements on construction-related traffic impacts on opening day would result in a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the construction-related traffic impacts in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses at one or more of the mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements.  Construction of the replacement housing at one or more of the mixed-use development sites for Alternative D could result in construction-related traffic similar to that described above for Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing. As described above for Alternative B, as part of approval and permitting process, the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for Alternative D would be required to undergo project-level environmental review and would be subject to all applicable jurisdictional regulations and permit requirements. Because construction of the replacement housing on one or more of the mixed-use development sites would occur in an existing developed area and would avoid or minimize construction-related traffic impacts, construction-related traffic impacts from Alternative D replacement housing would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the replacement housing at one or more of the mixed-use development sites included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the construction-related traffic impacts in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than one of the mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential for construction-related traffic impacts in 2020 as described for the replacement housing at one of the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential construction-related traffic impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Because Alternative D mixed-use development on the remaining site(s) would be constructed after 2020, the construction-related traffic impacts of this development is not analyzed under the 2020 (opening day) scenario. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and replacement housing at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would result in a less-than-significant construction-related traffic impact. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and replacement housing at one or more of the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would minimize the construction-related traffic impacts such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E would require a TMP per Caltrans requirements similar to Alternatives B, C, and D. However, construction of Alternative E would require full closure of existing US 50 through the affected area at times during construction. Additionally, it is likely that Alternative E would require construction outside of the established daytime hours to minimize traffic conflicts. Construction of Alternative E would occur in a single phase. The implementation of Alternative E would result in temporary delays during construction as a result of the lane closures and periodic full closures. Lane closures during construction would exacerbate this existing condition. In addition, weather conditions and noise requirements constrain the timing of construction to hours that would generally be subject to reduced traffic flow rates. Therefore, there is no feasible mitigation to reduce significant construction-related traffic impacts under Alternative E. Thus, construction-related traffic impacts would be significant and unavoidable under Alternative E for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would minimize the construction-related traffic impacts in 2020. However, there are no other feasible mitigation, avoidance, or minimization measures that could further reduce construction-related traffic impacts. Impact 3.6-8: Impacts on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety – 2020 (Opening Day) Alternatives B, C, D, and E would enhance the existing infrastructure and improve safety throughout the vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian network within the study area. No modifications to the existing vehicular, bicycle, or pedestrian infrastructure would occur under Alternative A, however vehicular traffic would increase within the study area thus impacting bicycle safety and the existing above state average traffic accidents and injuries occurring at the US 50/Lake Parkway Loop intersection. Construction of replacement housing at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would not substantially alter vehicular travel within the study area and would have no effect on bicycle or pedestrian infrastructure. Mixed-use development at the remaining site(s) would be constructed between 2020 and 2040; therefore, the Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development at these sites is not analyzed under the 2020 (opening day) scenario. NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the impacts on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; There would be no mechanism by which to implement or enforce avoidance or mitigation measures to minimize impacts on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2020 from Alternative A  CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Beneficial for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; Significant and Unavoidable impact for Alternative A  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Alternative A would result in no modifications to the existing conditions. The existing US 50/Lake Parkway Loop intersection had accident rates higher than the state average accident rates for fatalities plus injuries, and total accidents (see Table 3-6.4). The most commonly reported type of collision was of the “rear-end” variety, which is frequently associated with signalized intersections and stop-and-go traffic conditions. Under Alternative A, this intersection would remain as it is today, and vehicular traffic through the intersection would increase. Increased traffic through the US 50/Lake Parkway Loop intersection would likely exacerbate the number of vehicular accidents at this location. Additionally, the absence of continuous striped bicycle facilities along US 50, combined with the increase in traffic along this roadway segment would expose bicyclists to higher volumes of vehicles. Because with the no build alternative (Alternative A) there would be no mechanism by which to implement or enforce mitigation, this impact would remain significant and unavoidable for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, adverse effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2020 from Alternative A could not be reduced because there would be no mechanism by which to implement or enforce avoidance or mitigation measures.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements In 2020, implementation of transportation improvements included in Alternative B would reduce vehicular traffic along existing US 50 in the tourist core area, thus reducing bicycle, pedestrian, and vehicular exposure to safety hazards along this roadway segment and reducing the potential for vehicular accidents to occur.  Pedestrian and bicyclist exposure to vehicular traffic would be reduced with the improvements associated with Alternative B, including a pedestrian bridge over the new US 50 alignment connecting Van Sickle Bi-State Park to the Stateline area; shoulders/bicycle lanes and pedestrian sidewalks along Lake Tahoe Boulevard (existing US 50) for the full length of the study segment; and bicycle lanes/shoulders along the new US 50 alignment with sidewalks on at least one side of the roadway. The cycle track option would further reduce bicyclist exposure to vehicular traffic and enhance bicyclist safety. The cycle track option includes a two-way bike path separated from vehicular traffic by a barrier along the westbound side of Lake Tahoe Boulevard.  Safety of the existing pedestrian crossings along US 50 would be improved because of reduced traffic volumes and shorter crossing lengths associated with the narrowing of the existing US 50 roadway geometry. Additionally, Alternative B would include a new traffic signal at the Van Sickle Bi-State Park entrance that would provide a dedicated pedestrian crossing phase where none exists today.  The new US 50/Lake Parkway/Lake Tahoe Boulevard intersection could be constructed as either a roundabout or a signalized intersection. The existing US 50/Lake Parkway Loop intersection had accident rates higher than the state average accident rates for fatalities plus injuries, and total accidents (see Table 3-6.4). Roundabouts tend to reduce the severity of traffic accidents because the geometric design of the entry points eliminates right-angle collisions and high-entry speeds as well as reducing conflict points. Thus, implementation of the roundabout option for this intersection would reduce the severity of the traffic accidents occurring at this location, and in turn reduce the number of fatalities and injuries.  Thus, because the proposed design features would improve vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety, implementation of Alternative B transportation improvements on opening day would result in a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize environmental consequences related to vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The construction of replacement housing at one or more of the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B prior to construction transportation improvements would not affect the implementation of any of the planned roadway, bicycle, or pedestrian improvements. Prior to permit approval of the replacement housing, plans would be submitted to the City of South Lake Tahoe for review and approval. This process would include ensuring that all new development has adequate vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle access, in compliance with existing regulations. Therefore, Alternative B replacement housing would have a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential for effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2020 as described for the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites.

Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and replacement housing at one or more of the three mixed-use sites would result in a beneficial impact on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2020. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and replacement housing at one of the three mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would minimize the impacts on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements In 2020, implementation of transportation improvements included in Alternative C would reduce pedestrian and bicyclist exposure to vehicular traffic because improvements would include a new pedestrian bridge over the new US 50 alignment connecting Van Sickle Bi-State Park to the Stateline area; shoulders/bicycle lane and pedestrian sidewalks along eastbound US 50 for the full length of the study segment; and bicycle lanes/shoulders along the new westbound US 50 alignment with sidewalks on at least one side of the roadway. Additionally, Alternative C would include a new traffic signal at the Van Sickle Bi-State Park entrance that would provide a dedicated and safe pedestrian crossing phase where none exists today.  The new US 50/Lake Parkway/Lake Tahoe Boulevard intersection would be constructed as a signalized intersection. The existing US 50/Lake Parkway Loop intersection had accident rates higher than the state average accident rates for fatalities plus injuries, and total accidents (see Table 3-6.4). Because Alternative C would not change the type of intersection at this location, a change in accident rates or severity of accidents would not be anticipated to change at this intersection over existing conditions.  Because the proposed design features would improve vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety, implementation of Alternative C transportation improvements on opening day would result in a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize environmental consequences related to vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant).

Prior to permit approval of the replacement housing, plans would be submitted to the City of South Lake Tahoe for review and approval. This process would include ensuring that all new development has adequate vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle access, in compliance with existing regulations. Therefore, Alternative C replacement housing would have a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential for effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2020 as described for the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites.

Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents.  Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and replacement housing at one or more of the three mixed-use sites would result in a beneficial impact on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2020. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and replacement housing at one of the three mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would minimize the impacts on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements In 2020, implementation of transportation improvements included in Alternative D would reduce vehicular traffic along existing US 50 in the tourist core area, thus reducing pedestrian and bicycle exposure to safety hazards along this roadway segment and reducing the potential for vehicular accidents to occur. Existing pedestrian crossings along US 50 would be maintained; however, reduced traffic volumes and shorter crossing lengths associated with the narrowing of the existing US 50 roadway geometry would enhance bicycle and pedestrian safety. Additionally, Alternative D would include a new traffic signal at the Van Sickle Bi-State Park entrance that would provide a dedicated and safe pedestrian crossing phase where none exists today.  Pedestrian and bicyclist exposure to vehicular traffic would be reduced because Alternative D would provide a pedestrian bridge over the new US 50 alignment connecting Van Sickle Bi-State Park to the Stateline area; shoulders/bicycle lanes and pedestrian sidewalks along Lake Tahoe Boulevard (existing US 50) for the full length of the study segment; and bicycle lanes/shoulders along the new US 50 alignment, with sidewalks on at least one side of the roadway.  The new US 50/Lake Parkway/Lake Tahoe Boulevard intersection could be constructed as either a roundabout or a signalized intersection. The existing US 50/Lake Parkway Loop intersection had accident rates higher than the state average accident rates for fatalities plus injuries, and total accidents (see Table 3-6.4). Roundabouts tend to reduce the severity of traffic accidents because the geometric design of the entry points eliminates right-angle collisions and high-entry speeds as well as reducing conflict points. Thus, implementation of the roundabout option for this intersection would reduce the severity of the traffic accidents occurring at this location, and in turn reduce the number of fatalities and injuries.  Thus, because the proposed design features would improve traffic, bicycle, and pedestrian safety, implementation of Alternative D transportation improvements on opening day would result in a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize environmental consequences related to vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant).

Prior to permit approval of the replacement housing, plans would be submitted to the City of South Lake Tahoe for review and approval. This process would include ensuring that all new development has adequate vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle access, in compliance with existing regulations. Therefore, Alternative D replacement housing would have a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential for effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2020 as described for the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2020 would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents.  Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and replacement housing at one or more of the three mixed-use sites would result in a beneficial impact on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2020. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and replacement housing at one of the three mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would minimize the impacts on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative E: Skywalk In 2020, Alternative E would construct a pedestrian skywalk over the entire width and length of existing US 50 within the tourist core between approximately 100 feet south of Stateline Avenue and near the northern end of the Montbleu Resort (about 450 feet south of Lake Parkway) and removal of the existing pedestrian scramble. This alternative would not result in any other transportation-related changes.  The construction of a new pedestrian skywalk over existing US 50 between Stateline Avenue and Montbleu Resort and Casino would provide complete grade separation of pedestrians and bicyclists from vehicular traffic, thus reducing pedestrian and bicyclist exposure to vehicular traffic. Additionally, elimination of the at-grade pedestrian crossing, which requires motorists to stop, reduces the potential for rear-end vehicular accidents at this location.  Thus, because the proposed design features would improve traffic, bicycle, and pedestrian safety, implementation of Alternative E on opening day would result in a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize environmental consequences related to vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Impact 3.6-9: Impacts on emergency access – 2020 (Opening Day)  The build alternatives could affect police services, fire protection, and emergency medical services response times and delivery of emergency services. Alternatives B, D, and E would reduce congestion along existing US 50 and thereby improve long-term emergency access within the study area. There would be no changes under Alternative A. Alternative C would result in increased congestion and reduced emergency access to a segment of existing US 50 due to the new circulation patterns. Because mixed-use development would be constructed between 2020 and 2040, Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development were not analyzed under this 2020 (opening day) scenario. Replacement housing constructed at one of the three mixed-use development sites under the 2020 scenario would not interfere with existing emergency access and would be constructed to meet City requirements for emergency access. NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives A, B, D, and E would avoid or minimize the impacts on emergency access in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; Mitigation Measure 3.6-9 has been incorporated into Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to emergency access in 2020 CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives A, B, D, and E; Significant and Unavoidable for Alternative C with implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.6-9 Alternative A: No Build (No Project) No modifications to the existing conditions would occur under Alternative A, and emergency access routes would be maintained. However, during summer peak hours, traffic operations along US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Lake Parkway would experience degraded LOS and reduced speeds compared to existing conditions. However, the reduced speeds would be minimal, even during the summer peak hours. Thus, the no build alternative would result in a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative A would avoid or minimize the impacts on emergency access in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements US 50, with Alternative B transportation improvements, would remain four lanes wide and provide improved traffic flow, allowing emergency vehicles to travel from Pioneer Trail to Lake Parkway as quickly as today. Emergency access to the parcels along existing US 50 between Park Avenue and Lake Parkway would be maintained and, although the roadway would be narrowed, traffic flow would be improved during the summer peak. Back and side street access to the parcels between Park Avenue and Lake Parkway would remain, thus providing multiple emergency routes.  Additionally, as required by Caltrans, the TMP for the construction phase of the project would be coordinated with emergency services and all emergency service entities would be notified of any lane or road closures during construction to ensure adequate access for emergency vehicles throughout the construction period.  Therefore, Alternative B would maintain current emergency access routes and points to existing land uses in the study area and even with the narrowing of existing US 50, the improved traffic flow would at least maintain emergency response time. Additionally, emergency access during the construction phase would be coordinated and ensured as an element of the TMP. Thus, the impact on emergency access from Alternative B transportation improvements would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the emergency access environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Because Alternative B mixed-use development would be constructed between 2020 and 2040, this condition is not analyzed under the 2020 (opening day) scenario. However, replacement housing with Alternative B would be constructed at one of the three mixed-use development sites prior to implementation of the transportation improvements in California and is analyzed here for the 2020 scenario. Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. Construction of the replacement housing at one of the three mixed-use development sites for Alternative B would not interfere with any existing emergency access. The replacement housing would require local jurisdictional review and approval. This process would include ensuring that the replacement housing has adequate emergency access, in compliance with existing regulations. Emergency access during construction would be subject to all applicable jurisdictional construction rules and regulations and would be addressed on a project specific level during the project permitting process. Thus, the impact on emergency access for Alternative B replacement housing would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the replacement housing at one of the three mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize the impacts on emergency access in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential for impacts on emergency access in 2020 as described for the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential emergency access impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and replacement housing at Site 3 would result in a less-than-significant impact on emergency access in 2020. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and replacement housing at one of the three mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would minimize the impacts on emergency access in 2020 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Alternative C transportation improvements would result in increased congestion along the existing US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Park Avenue in the westbound direction. The increase in study area congestion would result in emergency services response times declining. Additionally, the conversion of existing US 50 to a one-way street in the eastbound direction would result in emergency access from the Nevada side no longer being an option for the section of existing US 50 between Stateline Avenue and Lake Parkway. For this roadway segment, back and side streets along with parking lots would need to be used as emergency access routes. This change in circulation patterns would result in increased emergency response times due to indirect emergency access routes for some areas and increased congestion along multiple roadway segments. Thus, this would be a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to the emergency access.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Because Alternative C mixed-use development would be constructed between 2020 and 2040, this condition is not analyzed under the 2020 (opening day) scenario. However, replacement housing with Alternative C would be constructed at one of the three mixed-use development sites prior to implementation of the transportation improvements in California and is analyzed here for the 2020 scenario. Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Emergency access to the parcels along existing US 50 between Park Avenue and Lake Parkway would be maintained and although the roadway would be narrowed, traffic flow would be improved during the summer peak. Back and side street access to the parcels between Park Avenue and Lake Parkway would remain, thus providing multiple emergency routes.  Additionally, as required by Caltrans, the TMP for the construction phase of the project would be coordinated with emergency services and all emergency service entities would be notified of any lane or road closures during construction to ensure adequate access for emergency vehicles throughout the construction period.  Therefore, Alternative D would maintain current emergency access routes and points to existing land uses in the study area and even with the narrowing of existing US 50, the improved traffic flow would at least maintain emergency response time.

Therefore, emergency access would be maintained as it currently exists and emergency services response times would improve. However, construction of Alternative E would require full closure of existing US 50 through the affected area at times. As required by Caltrans, the TMP for the construction phase of the project would be coordinated with emergency services and all emergency service entities would be notified of any lane or road closures during construction to ensure adequate access for emergency vehicles throughout the construction period. Thus, Alternative E would result in a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize the emergency access environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.    Impact 3.6-10: Construction-related parking impacts  Construction staging areas for transportation improvements associated with Alternatives B, C, D, and E could be located on one or more parking lots at Harvey’s Lake Tahoe, Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, and Montbleu Resort and Casino. These property owners have indicated there is sufficient parking in their parking garages. A construction staging area on the Harvey’s parking lot would not interfere with the annual summer concert series. The use of any of these sites would be implemented through a willing agreement between the property owner and construction contractor. Construction impacts on parking associated with project construction would be temporary in nature and would only occur leading up to 2020 (opening day). Although construction details associated with the mixed-use component, including replacement housing, of each of the build alternatives where it is proposed (Alternatives B, C, and D) are not known at this time; it is anticipated that these alternatives with mixed-use development would meet their needs for a construction staging area on-site, on right-of-way acquired for the project, or through agreement with a private property owner for use of their land. The mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would be subject to all applicable regulations and permit requirements. Construction staging for Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at Site 3 would result in the amount of parking at the Heavenly Village Center to be below city parking requirements. Construction staging for Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at Sites 1 and 2 would not result in temporary loss of parking beyond the loss of parking located at the businesses that would be displaced, which would no longer be required. There would be no construction activities as part of Alternative A. NEPA Environmental Consequences: Mitigation Measure 3.6-10 has been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to temporary loss of parking; The design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize construction-related parking environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less than Significant for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; No Impact for Alternative A Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Because no modifications to the existing conditions would occur, implementation of Alternative A for the 2040 design year would result in no impact on supply of parking for purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements One or more parking lots at Harvey’s Lake Tahoe, Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, and Montbleu Resort and Casino may be temporarily closed during construction periods for Alternative B transportation improvements for use as a construction staging area. The parking stalls closed at Harvey’s Lake Tahoe are the same parking stalls that are closed every summer for the Lake Tahoe Outdoor Arena. It is anticipated that only one or two of the sites would be used for staging, but all three sites are potential staging areas. All parking would be reopened at the end of construction. In consultation with South Tahoe Association of Resorts, which includes the casino properties, during outreach in 2014 and 2015, they acknowledged that there is substantial available parking in their parking garages. The use of any of these sites would be implemented through a willing agreement between the property owner and construction contractor. If the Harvey’s parking lot would be used for construction staging, the use of the parking lot would only occur outside of the period during which the parking lot is used for the annual summer concert series (in general, before July and after mid-September). Table 3.6-15 shows the total number of parking stalls at each location that may be impacted. Table 3.6-15 Temporary Parking Impacts  Location  Temporary Parking Stalls Removed  Total Existing Parking Stalls  Maximum Percent of Lost Parking Stalls  Harvey’s Lake Tahoe  415  415  100%  Hard Rock Hotel and Casino  415  510  82%  Montbleu Resort and Casino  155  760  20%  Note: Parking stall total and lost parking stall percentage does not include parking stalls available within onsite parking garages. Source: compiled by Wood Rodgers in 2016   Construction impacts to parking are temporary in nature and would only occur leading up to opening day (2020) for Alternative B transportation improvements. Thus, temporary impacts on parking during construction of the project would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize construction-related parking environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. Construction of the mixed-use component, including replacement housing, of Alternative B could result in construction-related parking impacts. Specific construction details for the mixed-use development at Sites 1 and 2 are not known at this time; however, it is anticipated that Alternative B would meet the needs for a construction staging area on-site, on right-of-way acquired for the project, or through agreement with a private property owner for use of their land. Construction of mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at Sites 1 and 2 would not result in temporary loss of parking beyond the loss of parking located at the businesses that would be displaced, which would no longer be required. Construction of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at Site 3 would also be anticipated to meet the needs for a construction staging area on-site, on right-of-way acquired for the project, or through agreement with a private owner for use of their land. If Site 3 is used for a construction staging area, then approximately 250 of the 789 total parking stalls would be temporarily removed from the supply of parking at the Heavenly Village Center and the amount of parking at the center would be below city parking requirements of 750 parking stalls. Because construction would likely occur during peak visitor periods and parking demand during the summer months, the loss of approximately 30 percent of required parking supply at Site 3 would be substantial.  As part of approval and permitting process, the mixed-use portion, including replacement housing, of Alternative B at any of the three mixed-use development sites would be required to undergo project-level environmental review and would be subject to all applicable jurisdictional regulations and permit requirements. However, because use of Site 3 for construction staging would substantially reduce parking supply below city requirements, the temporary loss of parking from construction at Site 3 would be significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at Site 3 as part of Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to temporary loss of parking at the Heavenly Village Center.  Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar construction-related parking impacts as described for the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential construction-related parking impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a significant construction-related parking impact. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative B that would minimize the construction-related parking environmental consequences. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Construction impacts on parking resulting from implementation of Alternative C transportation improvements are identical to those for Alternative B transportation improvements. Construction impacts on parking are temporary in nature and would only occur leading up to opening day (2020) for Alternative C transportation improvements. Thus, temporary impacts on parking during construction of the project would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements as part of Alternative C would avoid or minimize construction-related parking environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Construction impacts on parking are temporary in nature and would only occur leading up to opening day (2020) for Alternative D transportation improvements. Thus, temporary impacts on parking during construction of the project would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements as part of Alternative D would avoid or minimize construction-related parking environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Construction impacts to parking are temporary in nature and would only occur leading up to opening day (2020) for Alternative E. Thus, temporary impacts on parking during construction of the project would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize construction-related parking environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Impact 3.6-11: Permanent parking impacts Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would result in the loss of between approximately 40 and 80 parking stalls at multiple businesses and Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in the loss of between approximately 250 and 310 parking stalls. The loss of parking from these alternatives with mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not be in addition to the parking losses from the transportation improvements. The amount of parking at Montbleu Resort and Casino would continue to be sufficient to meet city and county standards and the project would provide replacement parking equal to that lost at other businesses. Implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at Sites 1 and 2 would not result in permanent loss of parking at businesses that would be displaced, which would no longer be required. Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at Site 3 would cause the amount of parking at the Heavenly Village Center to fall below city parking requirements. Alternatives A and E would not result in any permanent losses of parking. NEPA Environmental Consequences: Mitigation Measure 3.6-11 has been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to permanent loss of parking; No Impact for Alternatives A and E CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less than Significant for Alternatives B, C, and D; No Impact for Alternatives A and E Alternative A: No Build (No Project) No modifications to the existing conditions would occur under Alternative A. Thus, there would be no impact on supply of parking for purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Proposed Action) Transportation Improvements Alternative B transportation improvements would permanently impact 51 parking stalls at six parcels. Parking losses at these parcels and associated businesses are shown in Table 3.6-16. Although some existing parking would be removed, Alternative B would construct replacement parking either on adjacent right-of-way areas or on other portions of the parcel for affected parcels. New replacement parking for the Apartment Complex would be constructed along the rear of the building on Primrose Road. There is an open area here that is large enough to replace the 15 existing stalls. Naked Fish Sushi, Vinny’s Pizza, and Powder House Ski and Board Rental all share a parking lot. Replacement parking for these businesses would be constructed along the portion of existing US 50 directly in front of the business. This portion of US 50 would be permanently closed under Alternative B, providing new area for parking. Per City of South Lake Tahoe parking requirements, the Heavenly Village Center is required to have approximately 750 parking stalls (actual parking required varies slightly as different types of commercial uses come and go). Alternative B transportation improvements would remove 16 parking stalls at the Heavenly Village Center. Because 773 parking stalls would remain, the Heavenly Village Center would continue to have more stalls than required by the city. Table 3.6-16 Alternative B Transportation Improvements Permanent Parking Impacts   Business  APN  Parking Stalls  Removed  Total Existing Parking Stalls  Maximum Percent of Lost Parking Stalls  Apartment Complex  029-371-01  15  15  100%  Naked Fish Sushi / Vinny’s Pizza / Powder House Ski and Board Rental  029-170-04  4  45  9%  Heavenly Village Center  029-442-08  16  789  2%  Thunderchief Inn  029-351-01  5  14  36%  Traveler’s Inn  029-351-20  6  24  25%  Montbleu Resort and Casino  1318-27-001-007  5  760  <1%  Note: Parking stall total and lost parking stall percentage does not include parking stalls available within onsite parking garages. APN = assessor’s parcel number Source: compiled by Wood Rodgers in 2016  The Thunderchief Inn and Traveler’s Inn parking loss would be replaced by constructing new parking stalls immediately to the west along Moss Road. This segment of Moss Road would be permanently closed under Alternative B, providing an area for replacement parking. Per Douglas County parking requirements, Montbleu Resort and Casino is required to have approximately 1,250 parking stalls. Alternative B transportation improvements would remove five parking stalls. Because approximately 1,335 total parking stalls (including within parking garage) would remain, Montbleu Resort and Casino would continue to have more stalls than required. Because the amount of parking at Heavenly Village Center and Montbleu Resort and Casino would continue to have sufficient parking to meet city and county standards and the project would provide replacement parking equal to those lost at the other businesses, the permanent impacts on parking from Alternative B transportation improvements would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the permanent parking environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would permanently impact parking at three businesses (see Table 3.6-17). The loss of parking at the Heavenly Village Center shown in Table 3.6-17 from implementation of Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, includes the loss of parking from Alternative B transportation improvements. Development of Site 1 would result in displacing some of the businesses and associated parking listed above in Table 3.6-16, including Naked Fish, Vinny’s Pizza, and Powder House Ski and Board Rental. Development of Site 2 would displace Thunderchief Inn and Traveler’s Inn and parking associated with these hotel/motels. Development of Site 3 would displace parking at the Heavenly Village Center. New replacement parking for the Apartment Complex would be constructed along the rear of the Apartment Complex building on Primrose Road. The mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at each of the three sites would include construction of parking.  Table 3.6-17 Alternative B Mixed-Use Development, including Replacement Housing, Permanent Parking Impacts   Business  APN  Parking Stalls Removed  Total Existing Parking Stalls  Maximum Percent of Lost Parking Stalls  Heavenly Village Center  029-442-08  250  789  32%  APN = assessor’s parcel number Source: compiled by Wood Rodgers in 2016  The loss of approximately 250 parking stalls from construction of mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at Site 3 would result in the amount of parking at the Heavenly Village Center to be below city parking requirements. This impact would be potentially significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, included in Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the permanent parking environmental consequences. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar permanent parking impacts as described for the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential permanent parking impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a potentially significant impact on permanent loss of parking. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative B that would further reduce to the extent feasible the permanent parking environmental consequences. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Alternative C transportation improvements would result in similar permanent losses of parking at the same businesses described above for Alternative B transportation improvements. The amount of parking affected by Alternative C transportation improvements is shown in Table 3.6-18. Alternative C would construct replacement parking either on adjacent right-of-way areas or on other portions of the parcel for affected parcels, as described above for Alternative B transportation improvements. Table 3.6-18 Alternative C Transportation Improvements Permanent Parking Impacts   Business  APN  Parking Stalls Removed  Total Existing Parking Stalls  Maximum Percent of Lost Parking Stalls  Apartment Complex  029-371-01  15  15  100%  Heavenly Village Center  029-442-08  9  789  1%  Thunderchief Inn  029-351-01  5  14  36%  Traveler’s Inn  029-351-20  7  24  30%  Montbleu Resort and Casino  1318-27-001-007  42  760  6%  Note: Parking stall total and lost parking stall percentage does not include parking stalls available within onsite parking garages. APN = assessor’s parcel number Source: compiled by Wood Rodgers in 2016  Because the amount of parking at Heavenly Village Center and Montbleu Resort and Casino would continue to have sufficient parking to meet city and county standards and the project would provide replacement parking equal to those lost at the other businesses, the permanent impacts on parking from Alternative C transportation improvements would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the permanent parking environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

The amount of parking affected by Alternative D transportation improvements is shown in Table 3.6-20. Alternative D does not propose to construct replacement parking. Table 3.6-20 Alternative D Transportation Improvements Permanent Parking Impacts   Business  APN  Parking Stalls  Closed  Total Existing Parking Stalls  Maximum Percent of Lost Parking Stalls  Heavenly Village Center  029-442-08  39  789  5%  Montbleu Resort and Casino  1318-27-001-007  5  760  <1%  Note: Parking stall total and lost parking stall percentage does not include parking stalls available within onsite parking garages. APN = assessor’s parcel number Source: compiled by Wood Rodgers in 2016  Per City of South Lake Tahoe parking requirements, the Heavenly Village Center is required to have approximately 750 parking stalls (actual parking required varies slightly as different types of commercial uses come and go). While Alternative D transportation improvements would remove 39 parking stalls, the required 750 total parking stalls would remain. The remaining parking would meet minimum parking requirements for the Heavenly Village Center. Per Douglas County parking requirements, Montbleu Resort and Casino is required to have approximately 1,250 parking stalls. Alternative D transportation improvements would remove five parking stalls. Because approximately 1,335 total parking stalls (including within parking garage) would remain, Montbleu Resort and Casino would still have more stalls than required. Because the amount of parking at Heavenly Village Center and Montbleu Resort and Casino would continue to have sufficient parking to meet city and county standards, the permanent impacts on parking from Alternative D transportation improvements would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the permanent parking environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Thus, no impact would occur for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Impact 3.6-12: Impacts on intersection operations – 2040 (Design Year) Under 2040 design year conditions, improvements under Alternatives B and D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would operate intersections at annual average and summer peak-hour LOS C or better. Under Alternative A, operations at two intersections would be degraded to unacceptable levels. Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would degrade operations at three intersections to unacceptable levels or exacerbate already unacceptable operations. Improvements under Alternative E would operate intersections at annual average and summer peak-hour LOS D or better. NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, D, and E would avoid or minimize the effects on intersection operations in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; Mitigation Measure 3.6-12 has been incorporated into Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to impacts on intersection operations in 2040; There would be no mechanism by which to implement or enforce avoidance or mitigation measures to minimize Alternative A impacts on intersection operations in 2040  CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less than Significant for Alternatives B, D, and E; Less Than Significant for Alternative C after implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.6-12; Significant and Unavoidable for Alternative A Table 3.6-22 summarizes the projected intersection traffic operations under Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements for the design year. Table 3.6-23 summarizes the projected intersection traffic operations under Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for the design year.  For the unsignalized intersections and roundabouts, the LOS for the movement with the lowest LOS/highest delay is shown. The shaded cells indicate that the projected LOS is below acceptable levels, which is considered a significant impact. Exhibits 3.6-19 through 3.6-22 show the study area volumes associated with each of the project alternatives transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing. Roadway geometrics for all alternatives would be consistent with those shown in the 2020 (opening day) impact analysis.  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) As shown in Table 3.6-22, Alternative A is projected to degrade operations to unacceptable levels at two intersections in 2040:   New US 50/Pioneer Trail/Old US 50– operations would be unacceptable as follows:  Summer peak hour: LOS E (65 seconds of delay)  Existing US 50/Stateline Avenue– operations would be unacceptable as follows:  Summer peak hour: LOS F (91 seconds of delay) Because these two study area intersections would operate at unacceptable LOS under 2040 conditions, and there would be no mechanism by which to implement or enforce mitigation, Alternative A would have a significant and unavoidable impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  For the purposes of NEPA, adverse effects on intersection operations in 2040 from Alternative A could not be reduced because there would be no mechanism by which to implement or enforce avoidance or mitigation measures.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements As shown in Table 3.6-22, all study area intersections for Alternative B transportation improvements are projected to operate at annual average and summer peak-hour LOS C or better under 2040 design year conditions. Alternative B transportation improvements would not degrade operations to unacceptable levels or exacerbate already unacceptable operations at the intersections; therefore, the impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the impacts on intersection operations in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements.  As shown in Table 3.6-23 all study area intersections for Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, are projected to operate at annual average and summer peak-hour LOS C or better under 2040 Design Year conditions. Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not degrade operations to unacceptable levels or exacerbate already unacceptable operations at the intersections; therefore, the impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize the impacts on intersection operations in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Table 3.6-22 2040 (Design Year) Intersection Traffic Operations  #  Intersection  Control Type  Alternative A (No Build)  Alternative B (Triangle)  Alternative C (Triangle One-Way)  Alternative D (PSR Alt 2)  Alternative E (Skywalk)  Annual Avg  Summer Pk  Annual Avg  Summer Pk  Annual Avg  Summer Pk  Annual Avg  Summer Pk  Annual Avg  Summer Pk  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  Delay (S/V)  LOS  1  Park Avenue/Pine Boulevard  TWSC1  10.1  B  10.6  B  9.5  A  9.8  A  9.8  A  10.2  B  9.5  A  9.8  A  10.1  B  10.6  B  2  Pine Boulevard/Stateline Avenue  AWSC2  8.3  A  8.7  A  8.3  A  8.7  A  8.6  A  9.2  A  8.3  A  8.7  A  8.3  A  8.7  A  3  New US 50/Pioneer Trail/Old US 503  Signal A   23.7  C   64.5  E    21.6  C   25.2  C  70.3  E   124.8  F   21.5  C   24.6  C   24.0  C   64.8  E*  Signal B  -  -  -  -   21.8  C   25.0  C  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  4  Old US 50/Park Avenue/Heavenly Village Way4  Signal A   15.8  B   52.4  D   20.6  C   27.3  C  15.1  B   38.6  D   19.6  B   23.4  C   17.7  B   61.2  E*  Signal B  -  -  -  -   22.5  C   32.9  C  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  Old US 50/Friday Avenue  Signal2   6.6  A   19.1  B   10.8  B   14.9  B   5.7  A   31.1  C   14.6  B   14.8  B   7.6  A   17.8  B  6  Old US 50/Stateline Avenue  Signal   35.9  D   90.6  F   18.7  B   20.6  C   13.3  B   81.6  F   19.4  B   22.9  C   10.7  B   12.9  B  7  New US 50/Lake Parkway/Old US 505  Signal   19.9  B   27.6  C   18.5  B   25.4  C   50.9  D   106.5  F   23.7  C   26.6  C   22.2  C   30.1  C  Rndabt6,7,10  -  -  -  -  7.6 (14.6)  A (B)  8.7 (17.2)  A (C)  45.4 (93.1)  E* (F)  160.6 (340.1)  F (F)  7.6 (14.6)  A (B)  8.7 (17.2)  A (C)  -  -  -  -  8  New US 50/Heavenly Village Way  Signal (AWSC8)  15.1  C  18.8  C   10.7  B   12.5  B  2.1  A   7.6  A   11.9  B   11.2  B  11.5  B  15.3  C  9  New US 50/Harrah’s Road  Signal (TWSC9)   6.6  A   19.1  B   4.4  A   4.9  A  9.8  A   6.5  A   4.1  A   4.3  A  15.1  C  18.8  C  Notes: AWSC = all-way stop-controlled; EB = eastbound; LOS = level of service; NB = northbound; SB = southbound; S/V = seconds per vehicle; TWSC = two-way stop-controlled.

However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential 2040 intersection operation impacts would be speculative at this time.

If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements.  As shown in Table 3.6-23, Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for 2040 design year conditions is projected to degrade operations to unacceptable levels or exacerbate already unacceptable operations at two intersections:   New US 50/Pioneer Trail/Old US 50 – operations would degrade as follows:  Summer peak hour: LOS E to F (70 second increase in delay)  New US 50/Lake Parkway/Old US 50 (signal and roundabout options) – operations would degrade as follows:  Signal summer peak hour: LOS C to F (86 second increase in delay)  Roundabout summer peak hour: LOS C to F (372 second increase in delay) Because three study area intersections would operate at unacceptable LOS F under 2040 design year conditions for Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, either degrading from an acceptable LOS or substantially exacerbating already unacceptable operations, this impact would be significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, with Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the impacts on intersection operations in 2040. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential for impacts on intersection operations in 2040 as described for the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites.

Alternative D transportation improvements would not degrade operations to unacceptable levels or exacerbate already unacceptable operations at the intersections; therefore, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the impacts on intersection operations in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements.  As shown in Table 3.6-23, all study area intersections under Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for 2040 design year conditions are projected to operate at annual average and summer peak-hour LOS C or better. Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not degrade operations to unacceptable levels or exacerbate already unacceptable operations at the intersections; therefore, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would avoid or minimize the impacts on intersection operations in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential for impacts on intersection operations in 2040 as described for the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites.

Thus, Alternative E would not degrade operations to unacceptable levels or exacerbate already unacceptable operations at the intersections; therefore, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize the impacts on intersection operations in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.   Impact 3.6-13: Impacts on roadway segment operations – 2040 (Design Year) Under 2040 design year conditions, Alternatives B and D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, and Alternative E would result in acceptable roadway segment LOS during annual average and summer peak hours. Under Alternative A, one roadway study segment would operate at unacceptable LOS. Under Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, three roadway segments would be reduced to unacceptable roadway segment LOS. NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, D, and E would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to roadway segment operations in 2040; Mitigation Measure 3.6-13 has been incorporated into Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to roadway segment operations in 2040; There would be no mechanism by which to implement or enforce avoidance or mitigation measures to minimize Alternative A impacts on roadway segment operations in 2040 CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, D, and E; Significant and Unavoidable for Alternative A; and Significant and Unavoidable for Alternative C with implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.6-13 Alternative A: No Build (No Project) As shown in Table 3.6-24, Alternative A for 2040 design year conditions is projected to degrade operations to unacceptable levels at one roadway segment:   Old US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Lake Parkway, w/5-lane segment between Pioneer Trail and Park Avenue) – operations would be unacceptable as follows:  Summer peak hour: LOS E  Because one roadway study segment would operate at unacceptable LOS under 2040 design year conditions for Alternative A, and there would be no mechanism by which to implement or enforce mitigation, this impact would be significant and unavoidable for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, adverse effects on roadway segment operations in 2040 from Alternative A could not be reduced because there would be no mechanism by which to implement or enforce avoidance or mitigation measures. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements As shown in Table 3.6-24, all roadway study segments under Alternative B transportation improvements are projected to operate at acceptable LOS under annual average and summer peak-hour conditions for the 2040 design year. One roadway study segment, westbound Old US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Lake Parkway with 3-lane segment between Pioneer Trail and Park Avenue, would operate at LOS E, but for less than 4 hours as analyzed using TRPA approved methodology, which is considered acceptable according to TRPA and Caltrans standards. Thus, Alternative B transportation improvements would not degrade operations to unacceptable levels or exacerbate already unacceptable operations for any roadway segments under 2040 design year conditions, and therefore this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to 2040 roadway segment operations such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements.  As shown in Table 3.6-25, all roadway study segments under Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, are projected to operate at acceptable levels under annual average and summer peak-hour conditions for the 2040 design year. One roadway study segment, westbound Old US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Lake Parkway with 3-lane segment between Pioneer Trail and Park Avenue, would operate at LOS E, but for less than 4 hours as analyzed using TRPA-approved methodology, which is considered acceptable according to TRPA and Caltrans standards.

However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential effects on 2040 roadway segments would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on 2040 roadway segment operations. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative B would minimize the environmental consequences related to 2040 roadway segment operations such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements As shown in Table 3.6-24, Alternative C transportation improvements for the 2040 design year is projected to degrade operations to unacceptable levels along two roadway segments:   Westbound Old US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Park Avenue – operations would be unacceptable as follows:  Annual average peak hour: LOS E   Summer peak hour: LOS E  One-way Eastbound US 50 between Park Avenue and Lake Parkway – operations would be unacceptable as follows:  Summer peak hour: LOS F For these two roadway segments, Alternative C would result in a significant impact during the summer peak hour. Therefore, Alternative C transportation improvements during the 2040 design year would result in a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to roadway segment operations in 2040. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

One roadway study segment, eastbound Old US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Lake Parkway with 5-lane segment between Pioneer Trail and Park Avenue, would operate at LOS E, but for less than 4 hours as analyzed using TRPA-approved methodology, which is considered acceptable according to TRPA and Caltrans standards.

The opportunity for community revitalization would be a source of reduced VMT, because visitor uses could be concentrated in a compact, pedestrian/bicycle/transit-served urban core, decreasing the need to take vehicle trips to reach some tourism destinations (e.g., hotel to restaurant or entertainment venue trip, retail shopping trips). The realignment, itself, would cause a small, localized increase in VMT for through traffic with Alternatives B, C, and D, because the route of US 50 would be slightly longer around the tourist core than through it; however, its mobility enhancements and support of planned development in an urban center would be consistent with attaining the regional total VMT threshold (as required by the Lake Tahoe Regional Plan and evaluated in the Regional Plan Update EIS).The realignment of US 50, would remain consistent with the VMT per capita goal of RTP/SCS EIR/EIS Alternative 3 and would support achievement of the Regional Plan VMT requirements, so the beneficial impact of the RTP on regional VMT would be sustained. Alternatives B, C, and D would help implement the RTP’s beneficial impact on regional VMT. Alternative A would affect VMT because it would not support revitalization of the tourist core and would retain the same length of US 50 in the corridor. For Alternative E, the existing roadway alignment would remain the same with separation of pedestrians on an elevated structure. It would not support revitalization in the tourist core as effectively as the realignment alternatives and the through-traffic trip length on US 50 would be unchanged.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives A, B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the impacts on VMT in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement  CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Beneficial for Alternatives B, C, and D; Less Than Significant for Alternatives A and E  Table 3.6-24 2040 (Design Year) Arterial Segment Traffic Operations  Arterial Segment  Arterial Class1  Dir  Alternative A (No-Build)  Alternative B (Triangle)  Alternative C (Triangle One-Way)   Alternative D (PSR Alt 2)  Alternative E (Skywalk)  Annual Avg  Summer Pk  Annual Avg  Summer Pk  Annual Avg  Summer Pk  Annual Avg  Summer Pk  Annual Avg  Summer Pk  Spd  LOS  Spd  LOS  Spd  LOS  Spd  LOS  Spd  LOS  Spd  LOS  Spd  LOS  Spd  LOS  Spd  LOS  Spd  LOS  New US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Lake Parkway  II  EB  -  -  -  -  24.3  C  24.2  C  -  -  -  -  25.8  C  26.0  C  -  -  -  -  II  WB  -  -  -  -  31.9  B  31.4  B  -  -  -  -  30.3  B  30.6  B  -  -  -  -  Old US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Lake Parkway, w/ 5-lane segment between Pioneer Trail and Park Avenue  III  EB  19.3  C  13.8  E*  17.3  D  14.9  D  -  -  -  -  16.3  D  15.1  D  21.6  C  16.8  D  III  WB  18.7  C  10.5  E  15.6  D  14.0  D  -  -  -  -  14.6  D  14.1  D  21.8  C  12.7  E*  Old US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Lake Parkway, w/ 3-lane segment between Pioneer Trail and Park Avenue  III  EB  -  -  -  -  17.0  D  16.4  D  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  III  WB  -  -  -  -  14.6  D  13.4  E*  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  Old US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Park Avenue  III  EB  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  23.2  C  11.2  E*  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  III  WB  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10.7  E  13.1  E  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  One-way EB US 50 between Park Avenue and Lake Parkway  III  EB  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  20.4  C  9.4  F  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  One-Way WB US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Lake Parkway  II  WB  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  15.5  E*  15.1  E*  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  Notes: EB = eastbound, LOS = level of service; Spd = average travel speed in miles per hour, WB = westbound.  Red-highlighted cells indicate that the segment is projected to operate at unacceptable LOS under TRPA standards. * Projected to operate at LOS E for less than 4 hours per day based on analysis of fifth highest hour, which is considered acceptable according to TRPA standards. - = Roadway segment does not exist under the specified alternative or is otherwise not applicable. 1.

The opportunity for community revitalization would be a source of reduced VMT, because visitor uses could be concentrated in a compact, pedestrian/bicycle/transit-served urban core, decreasing the need to take vehicle trips to reach some tourism destinations (e.g., hotel to restaurant or entertainment venue trip, retail shopping trips). The 2012 Regional Plan Update EIS addresses the VMT issue in Impact 3.3-3 and includes adoption of Mitigation Measure 3.3-3, Implement Additional VMT Reduction, to achieve a less-than-significant impact outcome (TRPA 2012a). The adopted RTP/SCS Final EIR/EIS addresses VMT issues in Master Response 11 (TMPO and TRPA 2012b:3-57 to 3-61). As discussed below, the realignment, itself, would cause a small, localized increase in VMT for through traffic with Alternatives B, C, and D, because the route of US 50 would be slightly longer around the tourist core than through it; however, its mobility enhancements and support of planned development in an urban core would be consistent with attaining the regional VMT threshold (as required by the Regional Plan and evaluated in the Regional Plan Update EIS). The realignment of US 50, would remain consistent with the VMT per capita goal of RTP/SCS EIR/EIS Alternative 3. Additionally, the mixed-use development proposed for Alternatives B, C, and D is accounted for in RTP/SCS EIR/EIS Alternative 3 and is consistent with the TPRA Regional Plan policies to concentrate redevelopment in urban centers, resulting in the beneficial impact of the RTP on regional VMT per capita and consistency with the Regional Plan’s VMT requirements.  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) The impact analysis for Alternative A in 2040 (design year) would be consistent with that of 2020 (opening day). Because RTP/SCS EIR/EIS Alternative 3 was determined to have a beneficial impact on VMT based on such reduction of trips, Alternative A would not substantially change VMT nor contribute toward the Region reaching its goal of reducing VMT 10 percent below 1981 levels. Thus, Alternative A in 2040 would have a less than significant impact on VMT for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative A would avoid or minimize the impacts on VMT in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements The impact analysis for Alternative B in 2040 (design year) would be consistent with that of 2020 (opening day). While the highway realignment in Alternative B would result in a small, localized increase in VMT when through trips are analyzed on their own, it is consistent with the community revitalization objectives of the approved RTP Alternative 3, which results in a beneficial reduction in regional VMT, and the Regional Plan, which includes attainment of the regional VMT threshold. Because RTP/SCS EIR/EIS Alternative 3 was determined to have a beneficial impact on VMT, implementation of Alternative B would support the Regional Plan’s pursuit of its goal of reducing VMT below 1981 levels. Thus, Alternative B transportation improvements would have a beneficial impact on VMT under 2040 design year conditions for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the 2040 VMT environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements.  The mixed-use development, including replacement housing, with Alternative B would generate more trips than the land uses being replaced (approximately 1,400–1,700 additional daily trips). While this would contribute to regional VMT, it would occur in a manner that is consistent with the Regional Plan land use designations and VMT reduction policies. The mixed-use development sites’ location in an urban center reflects the Regional Plan policies to concentrate development and implement a mix of uses that would help reduce VMT in conjunction with the vehicular and non-motor vehicle mobility improvements of Alternative B. Buildout of the Region was considered in the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS and the Regional Plan Update EIS when VMT impacts were analyzed. All of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would occur within the City of South Lake Tahoe in and near the tourist core, which is one of the areas designated by the Regional Plan as a Town Center/High Density Tourist District. Thus, the mixed-use development would be consistent with the planned location of urban redevelopment and the need for mixed uses that reduce VMT along with improved motor vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian improvements in an urban center that are reflected in RTP/SCS EIR/EIS Alternative 3 and the adopted 2012 Regional Plan. In both plans, the construction of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project and incentivized redevelopment in Town Centers, Regional Center, and the High Density Tourist District were included in the list of planned infrastructure. Therefore, because the mixed-use development was accounted for in RTP/SCS EIR/EIS Alternative 3 and is consistent with the Regional Plan, Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, under 2040 design year conditions would result in a beneficial impact on VMT for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the 2040 VMT environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential 2040 VMT environmental consequences as described for the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential 2040 VMT impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a beneficial impact on 2040 VMT. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize the 2040 VMT environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements The impact analysis for Alternative C in 2040 (design year) would be consistent with that of 2020 (opening day). Alternative C would be consistent with the community revitalization objectives of the approved RTP Alternative 3 and the Regional Plan. One of the intended outcomes of the revitalization of the tourist core addressed in the RTP would be a compact, mixed-use, urban center with strong walking, bicycling, and transit connections to reduce the need to use motor vehicles for trips that would begin and end in or near the tourist core. This would be accomplished by the close proximity of mixed, visitor-serving facilities in the tourist core area, the interconnections of pedestrian paths and bicycle facilities, and access to enhanced transit facilities. Thus, Alternative C transportation improvements would support the RTP’s beneficial impact on VMT per capita and achievement of the Regional Plan’s VMT requirements for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the 2040 VMT environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The mixed-use development, including replacement housing, under Alternative C would generate more trips than the land uses being replaced (approximately 1,400–1,700 additional daily trips).

However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential 2040 VMT impacts would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a beneficial impact on 2040 VMT. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative C would avoid or minimize the 2040 VMT environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements The impact analysis for Alternative D in 2040 (design year) would be consistent with that of 2020 (opening day). Alternative D would be consistent with the community revitalization objectives of the approved RTP Alternative 3. One of the intended outcomes of the revitalization of the tourist core addressed in the RTP would be a compact, mixed-use, urban center with strong walking, bicycling, and transit connections to reduce the need to use motor vehicles for trips that would begin and end in or near the tourist core. This would be accomplished by the close proximity of mixed, visitor-serving facilities in the tourist core area, the interconnections of pedestrian paths and bicycle facilities, and access to enhanced transit facilities. Thus, Alternative D transportation improvements would support the RTP’s beneficial impact on VMT for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the 2040 VMT environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

In both plans, the construction of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project and incentivized redevelopment in Town Centers, Regional Center, and the High Density Tourist District were included in the list of planned infrastructure. Therefore, because the mixed-use development was accounted for in RTP/SCS EIR/EIS Alternative 3 and is consistent with the Regional Plan, Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, under 2040 design year conditions would result in a beneficial impact on VMT for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the 2040 VMT environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential 2040 VMT environmental consequences as described for the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites.

Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a beneficial impact on 2040 VMT. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative D would avoid or minimize the 2040 VMT environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alternative E: Skywalk The impact analysis for Alternative E in 2040 (design year) would be consistent with that of 2020 (opening day). Alternative E assumes that a realigned US 50, which is included in RTP/SCS EIR/EIS Alternative 3, would not be constructed. Therefore, the community revitalization opportunity of the highway realignment would not be realized as effectively as one of the realignment alternatives, including the reduction of VMT made possible by revitalization of a more walkable, bikable, and transit-served urban center. Because RTP/SCS EIR/EIS Alternative 3 was determined to have a beneficial impact on VMT based on such reduction of trips from the community revitalization component, which would not be realized as effectively for Alternative E, it would not substantially change VMT nor contribute toward the Region Plan’s goal of reducing VMT at least 10 percent below 1981 levels. Thus, Alternative E in 2020 would have a less-than-significant impact on VMT for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize the 2040 VMT environmental consequences such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Impact 3.6-15: Impacts on bicycle and pedestrian facilities – 2040 (Design Year) Because of their design, Alternatives B, C, D, and E would not disrupt or interfere with existing or planned bicycle/pedestrian facilities; rather, they would enhance the existing infrastructure and create a bicycle and pedestrian network with enhanced connectivity. Furthermore, Alternatives B, C, D, and E would not create an inconsistency with any adopted policies related to bicycle or pedestrian systems. No modifications to the existing bicycle or pedestrian infrastructure would occur under Alternative A.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the impacts on bicycle and pedestrian facilities in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Beneficial for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; No Impact for Alternative A Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Because no modifications to existing conditions would occur, implementation of Alternative A for the 2040 design year would have no impact on bicycle and pedestrian facilities for purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Alternative B transportation improvements for the 2040 Design year would include a variety of bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure improvements that would improve connectivity within the study area. Alternative B would not disrupt or interfere with the implementation of planned bicycle/pedestrian facilities, nor would it result in unsafe conditions for bicyclists or pedestrians. Furthermore, Alternative B would not create an inconsistency with any adopted policies related to bicycle or pedestrian systems. Therefore, Alternative B transportation improvements would have a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the impacts on bicycle and pedestrian facilities in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The potential construction of mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative B for the 2040 design year would not affect the implementation of any of the planned bicycle or pedestrian improvements, which would improve connectivity within the study area. Therefore, Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would have a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize the impacts on bicycle and pedestrian facilities in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential for impacts on bicycle and pedestrian facilities in 2040 as described for the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential impacts on bicycle and pedestrian facilities would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a beneficial impact on bicycle and pedestrian facilities in 2040. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative B would minimize the impacts on bicycle and pedestrian facilities in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Alternative C transportation improvements for the 2040 design year would include bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure improvements that would increase pedestrian and bicycle connectivity throughout the study area. Alternative C would not disrupt or interfere with the implementation of planned bicycle/pedestrian facilities, nor would it result in unsafe conditions for bicyclists or pedestrians. Furthermore, Alternative C would not create an inconsistency with any adopted policies related to bicycle or pedestrian systems. Therefore, Alternative C transportation improvements would have a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the impacts on bicycle and pedestrian facilities in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a beneficial impact on bicycle and pedestrian facilities in 2040. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative C would minimize the impacts on bicycle and pedestrian facilities in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements Alternative D transportation improvements for the 2040 design year would include a variety of bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure improvements that would improve connectivity within the study area. Alternative D would not disrupt or interfere with the implementation of planned bicycle/pedestrian facilities, nor would it result in unsafe conditions for bicyclists or pedestrians. Furthermore, Alternative D would not create an inconsistency with any adopted policies related to bicycle or pedestrian systems. Therefore, Alternative D transportation improvements would have a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the impacts on bicycle and pedestrian facilities in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a beneficial impact on bicycle and pedestrian facilities in 2040. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative D would minimize the impacts on bicycle and pedestrian facilities in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E would involve construction of a pedestrian skywalk between the Montbleu Resort and Casino and Stateline Avenue through the resort-casino portion of the tourist core and would replace the existing at-grade pedestrian scramble in the resort-casino portion of the tourist core. The project would not create an inconsistency with any adopted policies related to bicycle or pedestrian systems. Therefore, Alternative E for the 2040 design year would have a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize the impacts on bicycle and pedestrian facilities in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Impact 3.6-16: Impacts on transit –2040 (Design Year) Alternatives B, C, D, and E would not disrupt or interfere with existing transit facilities and would enhance the existing transit infrastructure. Furthermore, none of the build alternatives would create an inconsistency with any adopted policies related to transit systems. The overall increased travel time under Alternative A would be minimal.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives A, B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the impacts on transit in the 2040 design year such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Beneficial for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; Less Than Significant for Alternative A Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Similar to Alternative A in 2020, the projected increase in vehicular traffic through the study area would result in LOS degrading. The segment of US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Park Avenue would experience a reduction of speed as result, as shown below:   Eastbound US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Park Avenue – average vehicular speed would degrade as follows:  Annual average peak hour: Reduction from 22.2 mph to 19.3 mph  Westbound US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Park Avenue – average vehicular speed would degrade as follows:  Annual average peak hour: Reduction from 21.6 mph to 18.7 mph The reduction in average mph anticipated with Alternative A would increase travel times along US 50, however, the overall increased travel time would be minimal. Thus, this would result in a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative A would avoid or minimize the impacts on transit in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Alternative B transportation improvements would not alter existing transit circulation for the 2040 design year. Alternative B would enhance safety and provide improved transit service. Alternative B would also include the construction of new bus shelters at existing bus stop locations where features are limited to signs and, in some cases, benches. Alternative B would improve transit service within the study area. Furthermore, the project would be consistent with adopted policies related to transit systems. Therefore, Alternative B transportation improvements would result in a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the impacts on transit in the 2040 design year such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The replacement housing would be constructed prior to the transportation improvements in California and, therefore, is assessed for the 2020 scenario in Impact 3.6-5, above. The potential construction of mixed-use development as part of Alternative B for the 2040 design year could generate additional transit demand and could add to the need for additional peak-hour transit capacity. However, as discussed in Impact 3.6-11, the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS accounts for buildout of the Region and the mixed-use development would be constructed in the area defined by the Regional Plan as a Town Center/High Density Tourist District. Thus, the mixed-use development was accounted for in the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS, and the proposed transit service expansions within that document would more than meet the demand anticipated under RTP buildout conditions. Therefore, Alternative B mixed-use development for the 2040 design year would have a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize the impacts on transit in the 2040 design year such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development would result in a beneficial impact on transit in 2040. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development as part of Alternative B would minimize the impacts on transit in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Alternative C transportation improvements for the 2040 design year would improve transit infrastructure and safety within the study area. Furthermore, the project would be consistent with adopted policies related to transit systems. Therefore, Alternative C transportation improvements would have a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the impacts on transit in the 2040 design year such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The replacement housing would be constructed prior to the transportation improvements in California and, therefore, is assessed for the 2020 scenario in Impact 3.6-5, above. The potential construction of mixed-use development as part of Alternative C for the 2040 design year could generate additional transit demand and could add to the need for additional peak-hour transit capacity. However, as discussed in Impact 3.6-11, the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS accounts for buildout of the Region and the mixed-use development would be constructed in the area defined by the Regional Plan as a Town Center/High Density Tourist District. Thus, the mixed-use development proposed for Alternative C was accounted for in the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS, and the proposed transit service expansions within that document would more than meet the demand anticipated under RTP buildout conditions. Therefore, Alternative C mixed-use development would have a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would avoid or minimize the impacts on transit in the 2040 design year such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development would result in a beneficial impact on transit in 2040. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development as part of Alternative C would minimize the impact on transit in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements Under Alternative D transportation improvements for the 2040 design year, existing transit circulation would not be altered. Alternative D would enhance safety and provide improved transit service by reducing travel times and delays associated with the existing congestion in the area. Alternative D would also include the construction of new bus shelters at bus stop locations where existing features are limited to signs and, in some cases, benches. Alternative D would improve transit service within the study area. Furthermore, the project would not create an inconsistency with any adopted policies related to transit systems. Therefore, Alternative D transportation improvements would have a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the impacts on transit in the 2040 design year such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The replacement housing would be constructed prior to the transportation improvements in California and, therefore, is assessed for the 2020 scenario in Impact 3.6-5, above. The construction of mixed-use development as part of Alternative D for the 2040 design year could potentially generate additional transit demand and could add to the need for additional peak-hour transit capacity. However, as discussed in Impact 3.6-11, the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS accounts for buildout of the Region and the mixed-use development would be constructed in the area defined by the Regional Plan as a Town Center/High Density Tourist District. Thus, the mixed-use development proposed for Alternative D would be accounted for in the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS, and the proposed transit service expansions within that document would more than meet the demand anticipated under RTP buildout conditions. Therefore, Alternative D mixed-use development would have a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would avoid or minimize the impacts on transit in the 2040 design year such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development would result in a beneficial impact on transit in 2040. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development as part of Alternative D would minimize impacts on transit in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative E: Skywalk Under Alternative E, there would be no changes to transit facilities in the study area; however, the existing pedestrian scramble between the Montbleu Resort and Casino and Hard Rock Hotel and Casino would be replaced by a pedestrian skywalk, resulting in improved safety for pedestrians and vehicles, including transit. Thus, the impact of Alternative E for the 2040 design year is beneficial for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize the impacts on transit in the 2040 design year such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Impact 3.6-17: Construction-related traffic impacts – 2040 (Design Year) Construction impacts are temporary in nature and would only occur leading up to opening day for each of the alternatives. However, the mixed-use development for each of the build alternatives where it is proposed (Alternatives B, C, and D), could be constructed following the 2020 opening day. Construction of the mixed-use development as part of the build alternatives could result in construction-related traffic and temporary disruption to traffic circulation in the area of construction. Construction details associated with the mixed-use development are not known at this time and as part of approval and permitting process, any identified impacts would be addressed. The mixed-use development would be subject to all applicable regulations and permit requirements. Because there is no mixed-use development included for Alternative A or Alternative E, there would be no construction during the 2040 (design year) scenario.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: No Impact for Alternatives A, B, C, D, and E CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  No Impact for Alternatives A, B, C, D, and E Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Because no modifications to the existing conditions would occur, implementation of Alternative A for the 2040 design year would result in no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Construction impacts are temporary in nature and would only occur leading up to opening day (2020) for Alternative B transportation improvements. Thus, no impact would occur for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Construction of the mixed-use development for Alternative B could result in construction-related traffic and temporary disruption to traffic circulation in the area of construction. (See Impact 3.6-6 for analysis of construction-related traffic impacts from constructing replacement housing at one of the three mixed-use development sites prior to construction of the transportation improvements). However, construction details for the mixed-use development is not known at this time. Additionally, as part of approval and permitting process, the mixed-use development for Alternative B would be required to undergo project-level environmental review and would be subject to all applicable jurisdictional regulations and permit requirements.  Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Construction impacts are temporary in nature and would only occur leading up to opening day (2020) for Alternative C transportation improvements. Thus, no impact would occur for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Construction of the mixed-use development for Alternative C could result in construction-related traffic and temporary disruption to traffic circulation in the area of construction. (See Impact 3.6-6 for analysis of construction-related traffic impacts from constructing replacement housing at one of the three mixed-use development sites prior to construction of the transportation improvements). However, construction details for the mixed-use development is not known at this time. Additionally, as part of approval and permitting process, the mixed-use development for Alternative C would be required to undergo project-level environmental review and would be subject to all applicable jurisdictional regulations and permit requirements. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements Construction impacts are temporary in nature and would only occur leading up to opening day (2020) for Alternative D transportation improvements. Thus, no impact would occur for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Construction of the mixed-use development for Alternative D could result in construction-related traffic and temporary disruption to traffic circulation in the area of construction. (See Impact 3.6-6 for analysis of construction-related traffic impacts from constructing replacement housing at one of the three mixed-use development sites prior to construction of the transportation improvements). However, construction details for the mixed-use development is not known at this time. Additionally, as part of approval and permitting process, the mixed-use development for Alternative D would be required to undergo project-level environmental review and would be subject to all applicable jurisdictional regulations and permit requirements. Alternative E: Skywalk Construction impacts are temporary in nature and would only occur leading up to opening day (2020) for Alternative E. Thus, no construction would occur for Alternative E in 2040 (design year), resulting in no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Impact 3.6-18: Impacts on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety – 2040 (Design Year) Alternatives B, C, D, and E would enhance the existing infrastructure and improve safety throughout the vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian network within the study area. No modifications to the existing vehicular, bicycle, or pedestrian infrastructure would occur under Alternative A; however, vehicular traffic would increase within the study area thus impacting bicycle safety and the existing above state average traffic accidents and injuries occurring at the US 50/Lake Parkway Loop intersection. NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the impacts on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040; There would be no mechanism by which to implement or enforce avoidance or mitigation measures to minimize impacts on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040 from Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Beneficial for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; Significant and Unavoidable for Alternative A  Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Alternative A in the 2040 (design year) scenario would experience similar impacts to the vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety impacts in the 2020 (opening day) scenario. The above state average accident rates at the US 50/Lake Parkway Loop intersection could be exacerbated with an increase in vehicular traffic through this intersection. Additionally, the absence of continuous striped bicycle facilities along US 50, combined with the increase in traffic along this roadway segment would expose bicyclists to higher volumes of vehicles. Thus, because there would be no mechanism by which to implement or enforce mitigation, Alternative A would result in a significant and unavoidable impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, adverse effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040 from Alternative A could not be reduced because there would be no mechanism by which to implement or enforce avoidance or mitigation measures.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Alternative B transportation improvements for the 2040 design year would reduce vehicular traffic along US 50 in the tourist core, thus reducing exposure to traffic for bicycles and pedestrians along this roadway segment and reducing the potential for vehicular accidents to occur.  Existing pedestrian crossings along US 50 would be maintained but would be safer because of reduced traffic volumes and shorter crossing lengths associated with the narrowing of the existing US 50 roadway geometry. Additionally, Alternative B would include a new traffic signal at the Van Sickle Bi-State Park entrance that would provide a dedicated and safe pedestrian crossing phase where none exists today.  The new US 50/Lake Parkway/Lake Tahoe Boulevard intersection could be constructed as either a roundabout or a signalized intersection. The existing US 50/Lake Parkway Loop intersection had accident rates higher than the state average accident rates for fatalities plus injuries, and total accidents (see Table 3-6.4). Roundabouts tend to reduce the severity of traffic accidents because the geometric design of the entry points eliminates right-angle collisions and high-entry speeds as well as reducing conflict points. Thus, implementation of the roundabout option for this intersection would reduce the severity of the traffic accidents occurring at this location, and in turn reduce the number of fatalities and injuries. Therefore, Alternative B transportation improvements would have a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements.  The construction of mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative B for the 2040 design year would not affect the implementation of any of the planned roadway, bicycle, or pedestrian improvements. Prior to approval of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, plans would be submitted to the City of South Lake Tahoe for review and approval. This process would include ensuring that all new development has adequate vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle access, in compliance with existing regulations. Therefore, Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would have a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential for effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040 as described for the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040 would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a beneficial impact on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative B would minimize the effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Under Alternative C transportation improvements for the 2040 design year, pedestrian and bicyclist exposure to vehicular traffic would be reduced because project features would include a new pedestrian bridge over the new US 50 alignment connecting the Van Sickle Bi-State Park to the Stateline area; shoulders/bicycle lane and pedestrian sidewalks along eastbound US 50 (Old US 50) for the full length of the study segment; and bicycle lanes/shoulders along the new US 50 alignment with sidewalks on at least one side of the roadway. Additionally, Alternative C would include a new traffic signal at the Van Sickle Bi-State Park entrance that would provide a dedicated and safe pedestrian crossing phase where none exists today.  The new US 50/Lake Parkway/Lake Tahoe Boulevard intersection could be constructed as a signalized intersection. The existing US 50/Lake Parkway Loop intersection had accident rates higher than the state average accident rates for fatalities plus injuries, and total accidents (see Table 3-6.4). Because Alternative C would not change the type of intersection at this location, a change in accident rates or severity of accidents would not be anticipated to change at this intersection over existing conditions.  Therefore, Alternative C transportation improvements would have a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The construction of mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative C for the 2040 design year would not affect the implementation of any of the planned roadway, bicycle, or pedestrian improvements previously identified for Alternative C transportation improvements. Prior to approval of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, plans would be submitted to the City of South Lake Tahoe for review and approval. This process would include ensuring that all new development has adequate vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle access, in compliance with existing regulations. Therefore, Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would have a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040 would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a beneficial impact on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative C would minimize the effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements Alternative D transportation improvements for the 2040 design year would reduce vehicular traffic along US 50 in the tourist core, thus reducing exposure to vehicular traffic for bicycles and pedestrians along this roadway segment and reducing the potential for vehicular crashes to occur.  The new US 50/Lake Parkway/Lake Tahoe Boulevard intersection could be constructed as either a roundabout or a signalized intersection. The existing US 50/Lake Parkway Loop intersection had accident rates higher than the state average accident rates for fatalities plus injuries, and total accidents (see Table 3-6.4). Roundabouts tend to reduce the severity of traffic accidents because the geometric design of the entry points eliminates right-angle collisions and high-entry speeds as well as reducing conflict points. Thus, implementation of the roundabout option for this intersection would reduce the severity of the traffic accidents occurring at this location, and in turn reduce the number of fatalities and injuries. Therefore, Alternative D transportation improvements would have a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The construction of mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative D for the 2040 design year would not affect the implementation of any of the planned roadway, bicycle, or pedestrian improvements. Prior to approval of the proposed mixed-use development, including replacement housing, plans would be submitted to the City of South Lake Tahoe for review and approval. This process would include ensuring that all new development has adequate vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle access in compliance with existing regulations. Therefore, Alternative D with mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would have a beneficial impact. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential for effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040 as described for the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040 would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a beneficial impact on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative D would minimize the effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E would involve construction of a new pedestrian skywalk between the Montbleu Resort and Casino and Stateline Avenue in the resort-casino portion of the tourist core and removal of the existing pedestrian scramble. This would create complete grade separation of pedestrians and bicyclists from vehicular traffic, thus reducing pedestrian and bicyclist exposure to vehicular traffic. Additionally, elimination of the at-grade pedestrian crossing, which requires motorists to stop, would reduce the potential for rear-end vehicular accidents at this location. Therefore, Alternative E would have a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize the effects on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Impact 3.6-19: Impacts on emergency access – 2040 (Design Year) Alternatives B and D would reduce congestion along existing US 50 and thereby improve long-term emergency access within the study area. Alternative E would also reduce congestion along existing US 50 and additionally does not include any mixed-use development that would add trips to the roadway network and potentially affect emergency access during the construction phase. Alternative A would result in traffic conditions worsening during the summer peak along US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Lake Parkway resulting in impacts on emergency access. Alternative C would result in increased congestion and reduced operational emergency access to a segment of US 50 due to the new circulation patterns, impeding emergency access. NEPA Environmental Consequences: The design features of Alternatives B, D, and E would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to emergency access in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; Mitigation Measure 3.6-19 has been incorporated into Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to impacts on emergency access in 2040; There would be no mechanism by which to implement or enforce avoidance or mitigation measures to minimize impacts on vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety in 2040 from Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Beneficial for Alternative E; Less Than Significant for Alternatives B and D; Significant and Unavoidable for Alternative A; Significant and Unavoidable for Alternative C with implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.6-19 Alternative A: No Build (No Project) No modifications to the existing conditions would occur under Alternative A, and emergency access routes would be maintained. However, during summer peak hours, traffic operations along US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Lake Parkway would experience degraded LOS and reduced speeds compared to existing conditions. The reduced speeds could reduce emergency response times in the study area during these summer peak hours. Additionally, as described previously, many of the local roads in the area are used as cut-through routes and become heavily congested during the summer peak as well, which limit their use as alternative routes for emergency vehicles. Thus, the no build alternative would result in traffic conditions worsening to a point to which emergency response times could be affected. Thus, because there would no mechanism to implement or enforce mitigation for Alternative A, this impact would be significant and unavoidable for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, adverse effects on emergency access in 2040 from Alternative A could not be reduced because there would be no mechanism by which to implement or enforce avoidance or mitigation measures.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements The operational impacts on emergency access for Alternative B transportation improvements in the 2040 (design year) scenario would be consistent with the 2020 (opening day) impacts. Construction of the transportation improvements would be complete by 2040, and thus is not considered. Alternative B would maintain current emergency access routes and points to existing land uses in the study area and even with the narrowing of existing US 50, the improved traffic flow would at the least maintain emergency response time. Thus, the impact on emergency access for Alternative B transportation improvements would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the impacts on emergency access in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing at one or more of the three mixed-use development sites (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). The replacement housing would be constructed prior to the transportation improvements in California and, therefore, is assessed for the 2020 scenario in Impact 3.6-8, above. The mixed-use development portion of the project would require local jurisdictional review and approval. This process would include ensuring that all new development has adequate emergency access, in compliance with existing regulations. Emergency access during construction would be subject to all applicable jurisdictional construction rules and regulations and would be addressed on a project specific level during the project permitting process. Thus, the impact on emergency access for Alternative B mixed-use development would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative B would avoid or minimize the impacts on emergency access in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development would result in a less-than-significant impact on emergency access in 2040. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development as part of Alternative B would minimize the impacts on emergency access in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements The operational impacts on emergency access from Alternative C transportation improvements in the 2040 (design year) scenario would be consistent with the 2020 (opening day) impacts. Construction of the transportation improvements would be complete by 2040, and thus is not considered. The change in circulation patterns would result in increased emergency response times due to indirect emergency access routes for some areas and increased congestion along multiple roadway segments. Thus, this would be a significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative C to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to impacts on emergency access in 2040.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing at one or more of the three mixed-use development sites (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). The replacement housing would be constructed prior to the transportation improvements in California and, therefore, is assessed for the 2020 scenario in Impact 3.6-8, above.  Similar to Alternative B, prior to approval of the mixed-use development, plans would be submitted to the appropriate entity for review and approval. This process would include ensuring that all new development has adequate emergency access, in compliance with existing regulations. Additionally, emergency access during construction would be subject to all applicable jurisdictional construction rules and regulations and would be addressed on a project specific level during the project permitting process. Thus, the impact on emergency access for Alternative C mixed-use development would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative C would avoid or minimize the impacts on emergency access in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development would result in a significant impact on emergency access in 2040. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into construction of the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to impacts on emergency access in 2040.  Alternative D: Project Study Report (Alternative 2) Transportation Improvements The impacts on operational emergency access for Alternative D transportation improvements in the 2040 (design year) scenario would be consistent with the 2020 (opening day) impacts. Construction of the transportation improvements would be complete by 2040, and thus is not considered. Alternative D would maintain current emergency access routes and points to existing land uses in the study area and even with the narrowing of Old US 50, the improved traffic flow would at the least maintain emergency response time. Thus, the impact on emergency access for Alternative D transportation improvements would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the impacts on emergency access in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing at one or more of the three mixed-use development sites (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). The replacement housing would be constructed prior to the transportation improvements in California and, therefore, is assessed for the 2020 scenario in Impact 3.6-8, above.  As discussed for Alternative B mixed-use development above, the mixed-use development portion of Alternative D would require local jurisdictional review and approval. This process would include ensuring that all new development has adequate emergency access, in compliance with existing regulations. Emergency access during construction would be subject to all applicable jurisdictional construction rules and regulations and would be addressed on a project specific level during the project permitting process. Thus, the impact on emergency access from Alternative D mixed-use development would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the mixed-use development at the mixed-use development sites as part of Alternative D would avoid or minimize the impacts on emergency access in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development would result in a less-than-significant impact on emergency access in 2040. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development as part of Alternative D would minimize the impacts on emergency access in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative E: Skywalk Construction of the transportation improvements would be complete by 2040, and thus is not considered. Consistent with 2020 (opening day), Alternative E in the 2040 (design year) scenario would improve arterial segment operations along existing US 50. Therefore, operational emergency access would be maintained as it currently exists and emergency services response times would improve. Thus, Alternative E would result in a beneficial impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize the impacts on emergency access in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Impact 3.6-20: Daily vehicle trip end (DVTE) impacts – 2040 (Design Year) Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would not generate any additional DVTEs. However, these three alternatives would all generate greater than 200 net new DVTEs with the implementation of the mixed-use development. Because the displaced housing would be replaced at a one for one basis with the replacement housing component of these alternatives, the replacement housing would not generate any net new DVTEs. Alternative A would include no modifications to the existing conditions. Alternative E would not generate any additional DVTEs.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: Mitigation Measure 3.6-20 has been incorporated into Alternatives B, C and D to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to generating additional daily vehicle trip ends; The design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to daily vehicle trip ends in 2040 such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less Than Significant for Alternative E; Less Than Significant for Alternatives B, C, and D after implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.6-20; No Impact for Alternative A Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Because no modifications to the existing conditions would occur, implementation of Alternative A would not generate any additional DVTEs. Thus, implementation of Alternative A would have no impact for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Alternative B transportation improvements would not generate any additional DVTEs. Thus, implementation of Alternative B transportation improvements would have a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative B would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to generating additional DVTEs such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. Because the displaced housing would be replaced at a one for one basis with the replacement housing component of these alternatives, the replacement housing would not generate any net new DVTEs. Alternative B mixed-use development would generate more than 200 net new daily vehicle trip ends (Wood Rodgers 2016a). The creation of more than 200 new daily trips would be a significant impact based on the TRPA significance criteria and for the purposes of CEQA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into construction of the mixed-use development as part of Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to generating additional DVTEs. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential for environmental consequences related to generating additional DVTEs in 2040 as described for the replacement housing at the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential increase in DVTEs would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would result in a significant impact from additional DVTEs. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into construction of the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to generating additional DVTEs.  Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Alternative C transportation improvements would not generate any additional DVTEs. Thus, implementation of Alternative C transportation improvements would have a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative C would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to generating additional DVTEs such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Thus, implementation of Alternative D transportation improvements would have a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of the transportation improvements included in Alternative D would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to generating additional DVTEs such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement.  Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Thus, implementation of Alternative E would have a less-than-significant impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to generating additional DVTEs such that no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. 3.6.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures Mitigation Measure 3.6-2: Change the eastbound and westbound directional traffic on US 50 This mitigation would apply to Alternative C transportation improvements for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. During subsequent design phases, the project proponent shall reverse the directions of traffic flow on US 50 such that eastbound US 50 would be realigned onto a new alignment along Lake Parkway southeast of existing US 50, and westbound US 50 would remain in place as under existing conditions. Significance after Mitigation If the direction of travel was reversed, then the Alternative C effect on intersection operations would be improved such that the following intersections would operate at an acceptable LOS (Wood Rodgers 2016):   New US 50/Pioneer Trail/Old US 50 intersection – summer peak LOS would improve from LOS F to LOS B  New US 50/Lake Parkway/Old US 50 intersection – summer peak LOS would improve from LOS F to LOS B The change in direction of travel would also cause the summer peak LOS at the Old US 50/Park Avenue/Heavenly Village Way intersection to drop from LOS B to LOS D, which is an acceptable LOS.  The refinements in design resulting from the change in travel direction could result in a slightly smaller footprint at the New US 50/Pioneer Trail/Old US 50 intersection, and small adjustments to the configuration of mixed-use developments Sites 1 and 2. Also, by diverting all of the eastbound traffic away from the tourist core, there could be related economic ramifications to businesses from the reduction in eastbound pass-by traffic.  However, because implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.6-2 would result in acceptable LOS operations at study area intersections with Alternative C transportation improvements, the impact would be reduced to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  For the purposes of NEPA, because of the reasons described above, the environmental consequences of implementing Alternative C transportation improvements with implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.6-2 would not be adverse. Mitigation Measure 3.6-3: Change the eastbound and westbound directional traffic on US 50 pursuance to Mitigation Measure 3.6-2 This mitigation would apply to Alternative C transportation improvements for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. See Mitigation Measure 3.6-2 above. The same mitigation measure would apply. Significance after Mitigation If the direction of travel was reversed, then the effects of Alternative C on roadway LOS for the segment of Old US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Park Avenue would improve nominally, and the annual average and peak summary roadway LOS would remain at LOS E for 4 or more hours (Wood Rodgers 2016). This would be a significant and unavoidable impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the environmental consequences of implementing Alternative C transportation improvements with implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.6-2 would remain adverse. Mitigation Measure 3.6-9: Change the eastbound and westbound directional traffic on US 50 pursuant to Mitigation Measure 3.6-2 This mitigation would apply to Alternative C transportation improvements for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. See Mitigation Measure 3.6-2 above. The same mitigation measure would apply. Significance after Mitigation If the direction of travel was reversed, then the Alternative C transportation improvements effect on intersection operations would improve as discussed under Mitigation 3.6-2, which would ease access for emergency responders. However, because the change in circulation patterns associated with Alternative C would remain, and no other mitigation measures could change this condition, this impact would remain significant and unavoidable for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the environmental consequences of implementing Alternative C transportation improvements would be adverse. Mitigation Measure 3.6-10: Prepare a detailed parking plan to meet Heavenly Village Center demand during construction, pursuant to Mitigation Measure 3.6-11 This mitigation would apply to Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at Site 3 for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. See Mitigation Measure 3.6-11. The same mitigation measure would apply. Significance after Mitigation Implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.6-10 would reduce the significant impact related to temporarily inadequate parking at the Heavenly Village Center as a result of development at Site 3, because the project applicant would prepare a parking plan that would determine the parking demand at the center and identify solutions that would reduce or meet the demand. The performance criterion for the plan would be to meet City of South Lake Tahoe parking standards at the Heavenly Village Center. The project applicant would implement recommendations in the parking plan to meet parking demand prior to beginning construction activities at Site 3 to avoid interim loss of parking supply necessary to meet demand. For these reasons, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the environmental consequences of implementing Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at Site 3 would not be adverse. Mitigation Measure 3.6-11: Prepare a detailed parking plan to inform revision of Heavenly Village Center’s Use Permit This mitigation would apply to Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at Site 3 for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. At the time of preparation of the project-level environmental plan for the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at Site 3, the project applicant shall prepare a parking plan in accordance with Section 6.10 of the City of South Lake Tahoe Code. The recommendations including in the parking plan to meet parking demand and achieve City of South Lake Tahoe parking standards would be implemented by the project applicant prior to ground-breaking of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at Site 3.  The parking plan shall be submitted to the City of South Lake Tahoe, and referred to TRPA as necessary to obtain a use permit for modification of the parking demand ratios at the Heavenly Village Center. It would demonstrate the adequacy of the Heavenly Village Center parking that would remain after displacement of parking behind Raley’s by construction of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at Site 3. The parking plan must demonstrate the following:  adequate off-street parking would be provided for the proposed use as determined by a parking plan;  the environmental impact of the use would be lessened by the reduction in parking spaces (City staff may condition the use permit); and  traffic safety for other vehicles and pedestrians would be enhanced by the lesser requirement. The parking plan may propose a reduction in parking demand ratio at this shopping center from those set forth in City Code Section 6.10 based on a plan that proposes, but would not be limited to, one or more of the following:  a transportation management plan, which would outline transit incentives, such as a shuttle system or free or reduced cost transit passes for tenants/employees;  additional parking, which could be constructed elsewhere in the project site for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project; and/or  establishment of a shared parking facility, in which uses have different peak periods, parking demand would not overlap, and would meet peak demands. Significance after Mitigation Implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.6-11 would reduce the potentially significant impact related to inadequate parking at the Heavenly Village Center as a result of development at Site 3 because the project applicant would prepare a parking plan that would determine the parking demand at the center and identify solutions that would reduce or meet the demand and attain city parking standards. The project would obtain a use permit from the City of South Lake Tahoe to allow the change in parking demand ratios at the Heavenly Village Center and the project applicant would implement recommendations in the parking plan to meet parking demand prior to groundbreaking at Site 3 in order to avoid any interim loss of parking supply to meet demand. For these reasons, this impact would be less than significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the environmental consequences of implementing Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at Site 3 would not be adverse. Mitigation Measure 3.6-12: Change the eastbound and westbound directional traffic on US 50 pursuant to Mitigation Measure 3.6-2 This mitigation would apply to Alternative C transportation improvements for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. See Mitigation Measure 3.6-2 above. The same mitigation measure would apply. Significance after Mitigation If the direction of travel was reversed, then the effects of Alternative C transportation improvements on intersection operations in 2040 would be improved such that the following intersections would operate at an acceptable LOS (Wood Rodgers 2016):   New US 50/Pioneer Trail/Old US 50 intersection – summer peak LOS would improve from LOS F to LOS C, and annual average LOS would improve from LOS E to LOS B  New US 50/Lake Parkway/Old US 50 intersection – summer peak LOS would improve from LOS F to LOS B  The change in direction of travel would also cause the annual average LOS at the Old US 50/Park Avenue/Heavenly Village Way intersection to drop from LOS B to LOS C, which is an acceptable LOS.  The refinements in design resulting from the change in travel direction could result in a slightly smaller footprint at the new US 50/Pioneer Trail/Old US 50 intersection, and small adjustments to the configuration of mixed-use developments Sites 1 and 2. Also, by diverting all of the eastbound traffic away from the tourist core, there could be related economic ramifications to businesses from the reduction in eastbound pass-by traffic.  However, because implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.6-12 would result in acceptable LOS operations at study area intersections with Alternative C transportation improvements, the impact would be reduced to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  For the purposes of NEPA, the environmental consequences of implementing Alternative C transportation improvements with implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.6-2 would not be adverse. Mitigation Measure 3.6-13: Change the eastbound and westbound directional traffic on US 50 pursuant to Mitigation Measure 3.6-2 This mitigation would apply to Alternative C transportation improvements for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. See Mitigation Measure 3.6-2 above. The same mitigation measure would apply. Significance after Mitigation If the direction of travel was reversed, then the Alternative C transportation improvements effect on roadway LOS for the segment of Old US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Park Avenue and between Park Avenue and Lake Parkway would improve nominally, and the annual average and peak summary roadway LOS would remain unacceptable (Wood Rodgers 2016). For this reason, this would be a significant and unavoidable impact for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the environmental consequences of implementing Alternative C transportation improvements with implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.6-2 would remain adverse. Mitigation Measure 3.6-19: Change the eastbound and westbound directional traffic on US 50 pursuant to Mitigation Measure 3.6-2 This mitigation would apply to Alternative C transportation improvements for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. See Mitigation Measure 3.6-2 above. The same mitigation measure would apply. Significance after Mitigation If the direction of travel was reversed, then the Alternative C transportation improvements effect on intersection operations would improve as discussed under Mitigation 3.6-2, which would ease access for emergency responders. However, because the change in circulation patterns associated with Alternative C would remain, and no other mitigation measures could change this condition, this impact would remain significant and unavoidable for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the environmental consequences of implementing Alternative C transportation improvements would be adverse. Mitigation Measure 3.6-20: Mitigate DTVE impacts through Air Quality Mitigation Fund contribution This mitigation would apply to Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. The project proponent shall contribute to the Air Quality Mitigation Fund in accordance with Chapter 65 – Traffic and Air Quality Mitigation Program of the TRPA Code. The air quality mitigation fee shall be assessed in accordance with the mitigation fee schedule in the TRPA Rules of Procedure. Fees generated by the air quality mitigation fee are used to support programs/improvements that reduce VMT, improve air quality, and encourage alternative modes of transportation. Significance after Mitigation Implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.6-20 would be used to support programs/improvements that reduce VMT, improve air quality, and encourage alternative modes of transportation and thus, the impact would be reduced to a less-than-significant level for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the environmental consequences of implementing Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development with implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.6-20 would not be adverse.     This page intentionally left blank.  3.8 CULTURAL RESOURCES This section analyzes and evaluates the potential impacts of the project on known and unknown cultural resources (also known as heritage resources). Cultural resources include districts, sites, buildings, structures, or objects generally older than 50 years and considered to be important to a culture, subculture, or community for scientific, traditional, religious, or other reasons. They include pre-historic resources, historic-era resources, and “tribal cultural resources” (the latter as defined by AB 52, Statutes of 2014, in Public Resources Code [PRC] Section 21074).  Archaeological resources are locations where human activity has altered the earth or left deposits of prehistoric or historic-era physical remains (e.g., stone tools, bottles, former roads, house foundations). Historical (or architectural) resources include standing buildings (e.g., houses, barns, outbuildings, cabins) and intact structures (e.g., dams, bridges).  Tribal cultural resources were added as a resource subject to review under CEQA, effective January 1, 2015 under AB 52. This is a new category of resources under CEQA for which tribes are experts. While NEPA and Section 106 have historically required consultation with Federally-recognized tribes, this statute is the first time CEQA has required consultation with California Native American tribes, upon written request from the tribe. Because the NOP for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project was issued in 2011, before the effective date of the consultation provisions of AB 52, the procedural prescriptions of the statute do not apply to this project. Nonetheless, communication with the Washoe Tribe of California and Nevada has been undertaken as part of the environmental analysis (see below). The term “cultural resources” as used in this document refers to all “built environment” resources (e.g., structures, bridges, railroads, water conveyance systems, etc.), culturally important resources, and archaeological resources (both prehistoric and historic), and culturally important places, regardless of significance.  No comment letters were received on the Notice of Preparation (NOP)/Notice of Intent (NOI) that pertain to cultural resources.  Technical reports prepared for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project that were used to prepare this section include the Archaeological Survey Report for the California Portion of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project (California Department of Transportation [Caltrans] 2015a), Historical Resources Evaluation Report for the California Portion of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project (Caltrans 2015b), Archaeological Survey Report for the Nevada Portion of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project (Nevada Department of Transportation [NDOT] 2015a), and Architectural Inventory Report for the Nevada Portion of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project (NDOT 2015b). Unique ethnic values or existing religious or sacred uses can be affected by projects, generally through changes to sites, structures, and areas that have religious or sacred significance. These can be permanent changes that alter or remove important features, or temporary changes that involve restriction of access to sacred sites during construction. During consultation, Darrel Cruz of the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California responded to requests for information or concerns regarding cultural resources in the study area. Mr. Cruz stated that the project site has been disturbed by urban improvements and that he does not know of any cultural resources in the project area, including unique ethnic values or religious or sacred uses. Because no areas that have religious or sacred significance or other cultural significance to the Washoe people have been identified during conversations with tribal representatives and the area has been highly disturbed by urbanization, there would be no impact and this topic is not discussed further in the EIR/EIS/EIS. Paleontological resources are addressed in Section 4.1, “Effects Found Not to be Significant,” of this EIR/EIS/EIS and are not discussed further in this section. 3.8.1 Regulatory Setting FEDERAL Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act Federal protection of cultural resources is governed by the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 and the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, as administered by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP). These laws and organizations maintain processes for determination of the effects on historical properties eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Federal and federally-sponsored programs and projects are reviewed pursuant to Section 106 of the NHPA. Section 106 of the NHPA requires federal agencies to consider the effects of proposed federal undertakings on historic properties. While NEPA calls for the federal government to invite the participation of any affected Native American tribes in the environmental review process, NHPA enhanced tribal roles in historic preservation and created the Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO) program. Federal agencies are obligated to consult with Federally-listed Native American tribal governments under Section 106 of NHPA. NHPA requires federal agencies to initiate consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) as part of the Section 106 review process. FHWA has initiated informal consultation with SHPO for the project. The Final EIR/EIS/EIS will disclose the results of the consultation. The results of the SHPO consultation may warrant additional analysis, avoidance, and mitigation. Section 106 of the NHPA and accompanying regulations (36 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Part 800) constitutes the main federal regulatory framework guiding cultural resources investigations and requires consideration of effects on properties that are listed in, or may be eligible for listing in, the NRHP. The NRHP is the nation’s master inventory of known historic resources. It is administered by the National Park Service and includes listings of buildings, structures, sites, objects, and districts that possess historic, architectural, engineering, archaeological, and cultural resources that are considered significant at the national, state, or local level.  National Register Criteria The formal criteria (36 CFR 60.4) for determining NRHP eligibility are as follows: 1. The property is at least 50 years old (although properties under 50 years of age that are of exceptional importance or are contributors to a district can also be listed); 2. It retains integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and associations; and 3. It possesses at least one of the following characteristics: a. Association with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of history (events); b. Association with the lives of persons significant in the past (persons); c. Distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or represents the work of a master, or possesses high artistic values, or represents a significant, distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction (architecture); or d. Has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important to prehistory or history (information potential). National Register Criteria Considerations Ordinarily, cemeteries, birthplaces, graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, structures that have been moved from their original locations, reconstructed historic buildings, properties primarily commemorative in nature, and properties that have achieved significance within the past 50 years shall not be considered eligible for the NRHP. However, such properties will qualify if they are integral parts of districts that do meet the criteria or if they fall within any of the following categories:  a. A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic distinction or historical importance;  b. A building or structure removed from its original location but which is primarily significant for architectural value, or which is the surviving structure most importantly associated with a historic person or event;  c. A birthplace or grave of a historical figure of outstanding importance if there is no appropriate site or building directly associated with his or her productive life;  d. A cemetery which derives its primary importance from graves of persons of transcendent importance, from age, from distinctive design features, or from association with historic events;  e. A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable environment and presented in a dignified manner as part of a restoration master plan, and when no other building or structure with the same association has survived;  f. A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or symbolic value has invested it with its own exceptional significance; or  g. A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional importance.  Advisory Council on Historic Preservation Under federal law, the Criteria of Adverse Effect are set forth by the ACHP in its implementing regulations, 36 CFR Part 800. As codified in 36 CFR Part 800.4(d)(2), if historic properties may be affected by a federal undertaking, the agency official shall assess adverse effects, if any, in accordance with the Criteria of Adverse Effect.  The Criteria of Adverse Effect (36 CFR 800.5 [a][1]) read: An adverse effect is found when an undertaking may alter, directly or indirectly, any of the characteristics of a historic property that qualify the property for inclusion in the [NRHP] in a manner that would diminish the integrity of the property’s location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, or association. Consideration shall be given to all qualifying characteristics of a historic property, including those that may have been identified subsequent to the original evaluation of the property’s eligibility for the [NRHP]. Adverse effects may include reasonably foreseeable effects caused by the undertaking that may occur later in time, be farther removed in distance or be cumulative.  36 CFR 800.5 (a)(2) reads: Adverse effects on historic properties include, but are not limited to:  (i) Physical destruction of or damage to all or part of the property;  (ii) Alteration of a property, including restoration, rehabilitation, repair, maintenance, stabilization, hazardous material remediation, and provision of handicapped access, that is not consistent with the [Secretary of the Interior’s] Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties (the Standards) (36 CFR part 68) and applicable guidelines;  (iii) Removal of the property from its historic location;  (iv) Change of the character of the property’s use or of physical features within the property’s setting that contribute to its historic significance;  (v) Introduction of visual, atmospheric, or audible elements that diminish the integrity of the property’s significant historic features;  (vi) Neglect of a property which causes its deterioration, except where such neglect and deterioration are recognized qualities of a property of religious and cultural significance to an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization; and  (vii) Transfer, lease, or sale of property out of Federal ownership or control without adequate and legally enforceable restrictions or conditions to ensure long-term preservation of the property’s historic significance. TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY Article V(c)(3) of the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact (Public Law 96-551) required the development of a conservation plan for the preservation, development, utilization and management of scenic and other natural resources within the Tahoe Basin, including historic resources. TRPA accomplishes historic resource protection through implementation of its Goals and Policies and Code provisions as described below. Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities TRPA has not established any environmental threshold carrying capacities related to cultural resources. Lake Tahoe Regional Plan TRPA regulates growth and development in the Lake Tahoe Region through the Regional Plan, which includes the Goals and Policies, Code of Ordinances, and other guidance documents. Please see Section 3.2, “Land Use,” for an analysis of the project’s consistency with Regional Plan policies. Goals and Policies The Goals and Policies document establishes guiding policies for each resource element. The Conservation Element (Chapter 4) of the Goals and Policies document includes a Cultural Subelement, with a goal to “[i]dentify and preserve sites of historical, cultural, and architectural significance within the Region” (Goal C-1). This goal is to be accomplished by identifying and protecting historical or culturally significant landmarks from damage or alteration (Policy C-1.1) and by establishing incentives for designating sites and structures as historically, culturally, or archaeologically significant (Policy C-1.2). The full text of these goals and policies, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with the goals and policies, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.” Code of Ordinances The Code is a compilation of the rules, regulations, and standards to implement the Regional Plan Goals and Policies. TRPA recognizes sites, objects, structures, districts or other resources, eligible for designation as resources of historical, cultural, archaeological paleontological, or architectural significance locally, regionally, state-wide, or nationally. Those resources must meet at least one of the criteria summarized below. Chapter 67 also provides for consultation with state historical agencies as well as the Washoe Tribe. Additionally, Standard 33.3.7 in Chapter 33 (Grading and Construction, Section 33.3, Grading Standards) addresses discovery of historical resources.  Resources Associated with Historically Significant Events and Sites. Such resources shall meet one or more of the following: a) Association with an important community function in the past; b) Association with a memorable happening in the past; or c) Contain outstanding qualities reminiscent of an early state of development in the region.  Resources Associated with Significant Persons. Such resources include: a) buildings or structures associated with a locally, regionally, or nationally known person; b) notable example or best surviving works or a pioneer architect, designer or master builder; or c) Structures associated with the life or work of significant persons.  Resources Embodying Distinctive Characteristics. Resources that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction that possess high artistic values or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity but whose components may lack individual distinction. Works of a master builder, designer, or architect also are eligible. Resources may be classified as significant if they are a prototype of, or a representative example of, a period style, architectural movement, or method of construction unique in the region, the states, or the nation.  State and Federal Guidelines. Archeological or paleontological resources protected or eligible for protection under state or federal guidelines.  Prehistoric Sites. Sites where prehistoric archaeological or paleontological resources that may contribute to the basic understanding of early cultural or biological development in the region.  Area Plans There are no Area Plans that contain cultural resources policies that apply to the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project. Plan Area Statements There are no Plan Area Statements that contain cultural resources policies that apply to the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project. STATE California California Register of Historical Resources The California Register of Historical Resources (CRHR) is a listing of California resources that are significant within the context of California’s history. The CRHR is a statewide program of similar scope and with similar criteria for inclusion as those used for the NRHP. All properties listed in or formally determined eligible for listing in the NRHP are eligible for the CRHR. In addition, properties designated under municipal or county ordinances are also eligible for listing in the CRHR. A historic resource must be significant at the local, state, or national level under one or more of the criteria defined in the California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 15, Chapter 11.5, Section 4850. The CRHR criteria are similar to the NRHP criteria and are tied to CEQA because any resource that meets the criteria below is considered a historical resource under CEQA. As noted above, all resources listed in or formally determined eligible for the NRHP are automatically listed in the CRHR. The CRHR uses four evaluation criteria: 1. Is associated with events or patterns of events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of local or regional history, or the cultural heritage of California or the United States. 2. Is associated with the lives of persons important to local, California, or national history. 3. Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or method of construction, or represents the work of a master, or possesses high artistic values. 4. Has yielded, or has the potential to yield, information important to the prehistory or history of the local area, California or the nation. Similar to the NRHP, a resource must meet one of the above criteria and retain integrity. The CRHR uses the same seven aspects of integrity as the NRHP. California Environmental Quality Act CEQA requires public agencies to consider the effects of their actions on “historical resources,” “unique archaeological resources,” and “tribal cultural resources.” Pursuant to PRC Section 21084.1, a “project that may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of an historical resource is a project that may have a significant effect on the environment.” Section 21083.2 requires agencies to determine whether proposed projects would have effects on unique archaeological resources. Sections 21083.3.1 and 21083.3.2 require evaluation of potential significant effects on “tribal cultural resources.” Historical Resources “Historical resource” is a term with a defined statutory meaning (PRC Section 21084.1; determining significant impacts on historical and archaeological resources is described in the State CEQA Guidelines, Sections 15064.5[a] and [b]). Under State CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5(a), historical resources include the following: 1. A resource listed in, or determined to be eligible by the State Historical Resources Commission, for listing in the California Register of Historical Resources (PRC Section 5024.1). 2. A resource included in a local register of historical resources, as defined in Section 5020.1(k) of the PRC or identified as significant in a historical resource survey meeting the requirements of PRC Section 5024.1(g), will be presumed to be historically or culturally significant. Public agencies must treat any such resource as significant unless the preponderance of evidence demonstrates that it is not historically or culturally significant. 3. Any object, building, structure, site, area, place, record, or manuscript which a lead agency determines to be historically significant or significant in the architectural, engineering, scientific, economic, agricultural, educational, social, political, military, or cultural annals of California may be considered to be a historical resource, provided the lead agency’s determination is supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record. Generally, a resource will be considered by the lead agency to be historically significant if the resource meets the criteria for listing in the CRHR (PRC Section 5024.1), including the following: a. Is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of California’s history and cultural heritage; b. Is associated with the lives of persons important in our past; c. Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or method of construction, or represents the work of an important creative individual, or possesses high artistic values; or d. Has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history. 4. The fact that a resource is not listed in or determined to be eligible for listing in the California Register of Historical Resources, not included in a local register of historical resources (pursuant to PRC Section 5020.1(k)), or identified in a historical resources survey (meeting the criteria in PRC Section 5024.1(g)) does not preclude a lead agency from determining that the resource may be an historical resource as defined in PRC Section 5020.1(j) or 5024.1. Unique Archaeological Resources CEQA also requires lead agencies to consider whether projects will impact unique archaeological resources. PRC Section 21083.2, subdivision (g), states that unique archaeological resource means an archaeological artifact, object, or site about which it can be clearly demonstrated that, without merely adding to the current body of knowledge, there is a high probability that it meets any of the following criteria: 1. Contains information needed to answer important scientific research questions and that there is a demonstrable public interest in that information; 2. Has a special and particular quality such as being the oldest of its type or the best available example of its type; or 3. Is directly associated with a scientifically recognized important prehistoric or historic event or person. Tribal Cultural Resources Assembly Bill (AB) 52, signed by the California Governor in September of 2014, establishes a new class of resources under CEQA: “tribal cultural resources.” It requires that lead agencies undertaking CEQA review must, upon written request of a California Native American tribe, begin consultation once the lead agency determines that the application for the project is complete, prior to the issuance of a NOP of an EIR or notice of intent to adopt a negative declaration or mitigated negative declaration.  AB 52 also requires consideration of the potential significant effects on tribal cultural resources as of January 1, 2015. To assist in this consideration, the law also required revision to CEQA Appendix G, the environmental checklist. This revision would create a new category in the checklist for “tribal cultural resources.”  The procedural element of AB 52 for consultation with California Native American tribes applies to those projects for which a lead agency has issued a NOP of an EIR or notice of intent to adopt a negative declaration or mitigated negative declaration on or after July 1, 2015. Because the NOP for the project was issued on November 2, 2011, the procedural consultation requirements of AB 52 do not apply. Nonetheless, tribal cultural resources are addressed as a category of cultural resources in this environmental document. Tribal cultural resources are defined in PRC Section 21074. They consist of sites, features, places, cultural landscapes, sacred places, and objects with cultural values to a California Native American tribe that are either included in the California Register of Historic Places, eligible for the register, or included on a local register. PRC Section 21083.3 requires lead agencies to determine if a significant impact on tribal cultural resources may occur, and if so, that feasible mitigation measures and alternatives must be discussed.  California Native American Historical, Cultural, and Sacred Sites Act The California Native American Historical, Cultural, and Sacred Sites Act applies to both State and private lands. The Act requires that upon discovery of human remains, construction or excavation activity cease and the county coroner be notified. If the remains are of a Native American, the coroner must notify the Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC). The NAHC then notifies those persons most likely to be descended from the Native American’s remains. The Act stipulates the procedures the descendants may follow for treating or disposing of the remains and associated grave goods. California Health and Safety Code If human remains are discovered, State Health and Safety Code Section 7050.5 states that further disturbances and activities shall stop in any area or nearby area suspected to overlie remains, and the County Coroner contacted. Pursuant to CA Public Resources Code (PRC) Section 5097.98, if the remains are thought to be Native American, the coroner will notify the Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC), which will then notify the Most Likely Descendent (MLD). At this time, the person who discovered the remains will contact the Caltrans District 3 District Native American Coordinator so that they may work with the MLD on the respectful treatment and disposition of the remains. Further provisions of PRC 5097.98 are to be followed as applicable. Nevada Nevada Office of Historic Preservation The Nevada State Historic Preservation Office (Nevada SHPO) is a state agency created by the NHPA. The agency’s responsibility is restricted to providing recommendations and comments on a federal agency’s determinations. As a service to state and local agencies, Nevada SHPO reviews projects for potential impacts on historic properties. The Nevada SHPO keeps an inventory of the state’s cultural resources to assist federal, state, and local agencies in planning projects so as to avoid impacts to important cultural resources. The Nevada Cultural Resource Information System (NVCRIS) is a collection of online GIS database services that contain recorded archaeological and architectural resources and inventories for the state. Additionally, the Nevada SHPO acts as a clearinghouse for nominations of sites and features to the NRHP. Nominations are first submitted for review by the Nevada SHPO and the History and Museum Board of Directors. With their approval, the nomination is forwarded to the Keeper of the National Register in Washington, D.C. The Nevada SHPO plays an advisory role to TRPA during project review of structures 50 years old or older. TRPA staff request comment in such circumstances and often coordinate with the Nevada SHPO on required studies and mitigation measures. Additionally, TRPA consults with the Nevada SHPO during the scoping process for all EISs and submits these documents for comment during the public comment period. LOCAL City of South Lake Tahoe The Natural and Cultural Resources Element of the City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan (adopted May 17, 2011) includes a goal to preserve and maintain sites and structures that serve as significant, visible connections to South Lake Tahoe’s social, cultural, and architectural history (Goal NCR-4). Policies to implement this goal include preservation of sites of historical, cultural, and architectural significance (Policy NCR-4.1); designating historic landmarks (Policy NCR-4.2); requiring archeological investigations for all applicable discretionary projects (Policy NCR-4.3); and specifying appropriate actions if human remains are discovered (Policy NCR-4.5). The full text of these goals and policies, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with the goals and policies, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.” Douglas County The Historic Preservation Element (Chapter 10) of the 2011 Douglas County Master Plan (adopted March 1, 2012) includes a goal to preserve Douglas County’s historic, cultural, and archaeological resources as physical reminders of the county’s past and as unique focal points to shape the county’s identity, now and in the future (Goal 1). Policies include preservation of the county’s cultural heritage (Policy 1.1) and encouraging the development of historical preservation efforts (Policy 1.2). The full text of these goals and policies, along with a discussion of the project’s consistency with the goals and policies, is included in Appendix E, “Goals and Policies Consistency Analysis.”  3.8.2 Affected Environment AREA OF POTENTIAL EFFECT Consistent with general cultural resource practices, the archaeological area of potential effect (APE) follows the project footprint and all potential staging areas. It includes the total right-of-way (existing and required) throughout the project site. The APE for the built environment encompasses areas that might be either directly or indirectly affected by construction—that is, those areas within which the build alternatives could cause a change in character or use of historic properties (Exhibit 3.8-1). Exhibit 3.8-1 also shows the significant built-environment resources in the APE; these are discussed below under, “Significant Resources on the Project Site.”      Exhibit 3.8-1 Area of Potential Effect   ENVIRONMENT The project site is near the southeastern shore of Lake Tahoe at approximately 6,300 feet above sea level in the Sierra Nevada. Several perennial watercourses and a spring are in the vicinity of the project site. The project site is situated in the Yellow Pine belt, which consists of pines, firs, and cedars. Geologically, the project site is situated on Holocene (10,000 years before present [B.P.] to present) alluvial and lacustrine sediments near perennial streams and ponds following the recession of glaciers approximately 10,000 years ago.  PREHISTORY Archaeological research in the Sierra Nevada over the last 50 years has resulted in the accumulation of a substantial body of knowledge. Investigations that began in the 1950s revolved around examining sites throughout the Lake Tahoe vicinity, including the Lake shore line, and the high Sierra crest east of the Lake. These investigations led to the identification of the Martis and Kings Beach complexes. More recent investigations have led to important modifications of earlier archaeological sequences. For the purposes of this project, the following cultural sequence is used: Late Kings Beach—Washoe  700 B.P. to historic times Early Kings Beach  1,300 - 700 B.P. Martis  7,000 - 1,300 B.P. Early Holocene  10,500 - 7,000 B.P. Paleo-Indian  > 10,500 B.P. Paleo-Indian Period (>10,500 B.P.) The Paleo-Indian period marks the earliest occupation of the north-central Sierra Nevada and is represented by Clovis-like projectile points and basally-thinned concave base variants. Clovis-like fluted and basally-thinned concave base points have been found in a variety of contexts in northeastern California and the western Great Basin, but not specifically in the Lake Tahoe Basin. Their occurrence, however, in surrounding areas, including upland zones of the north-central Sierra Nevada, suggest it is only a matter of time before such evidence of Paleo-Indian occupation is documented in the Lake Tahoe Region. Early Holocene Period (10,500 - 7,000 B.P.) Assemblages for the Early Holocene period are characterized by various large lanceolate and Great Basin stemmed projectile points, which typically occur in conjunction with a variety of heavy core tools, bifaces, patterned and unpatterned flake tools, and chipped-stone crescents around the former shores of pluvial lakes and other ancient landforms. Recent research indicates that early Holocene period occupation of the Tahoe area may have been more intensive than was previously thought. It also now appears that early Holocene assemblages are not an early manifestation of the “Martis” phenomenon, but represent a separate cultural group. Martis Phase (7,000 - 1,300 B.P.) The time between 7,000 to 1,300 B.P. is the Martis phase, a term that refers to the Early and Middle Archaic periods in the Tahoe Region. While this relatively long span of time has been previously broken into a variety of phases and sub-periods (e.g., Spooner; Early, Middle, and Late Martis), primarily on the basis of putative temporal differences between projectile point types, such distinctions have not been adequately established for the Lake Tahoe Region. Based on current evidence, the array of projectile points that represent this phase—corner-notched, side-notched, and contracting-stem darts, as well as certain concave base variants—all appear to have been manufactured throughout this period. “Martis” times were probably not static. Middle Holocene climatic warming, commencing sometime after 8,000 B.P. and continuing to about 5,000 B.P., no doubt had a tremendous effect on Lake Tahoe Basin hydrology, resource productivity, and human subsistence and settlement. During the latter part of the Martis period (5,000-1,300 B.P.), climates became moister and population densities increased. It is at this time that we see the emergence of settlement hierarchies that include larger base camps and smaller logistical hunting, gathering, and fishing camps. During this time, basalt from Alder Hill, Watson Creek, and other upland quarries was being moved down the drainages that dissect the western slope of the Sierra Nevada into the foothills and Central Valley. It is possible that the movement of this basalt corresponded to the seasonal movements of people, and that there were connections and relationships between Martis and similarly dated foothill and Central Valley culture complexes. Kings Beach Phase (1,300 B.P. to historic period) The final period of prehistoric occupation in the Tahoe/Truckee region is referred to as the Kings Beach phase, and has generally been equated to the Washoe who inhabited this area at the time of historical contact. Assemblage characteristics associated with Kings Beach include a preference for siliceous toolstones (e.g., chert) and obsidian over basalt; small, light-weight corner- and side-notched arrow points; bedrock mortars; hullers (two-handed flat stones used for cracking nuts); and an emphasis on fishing and seed use. The earlier part of the phase is marked by Rose Spring-series points, the latter half by Desert Side-notched forms. The almost-exclusive use of cherts and obsidian beginning with Kings Beach tool kits coincides with the end of quarry production at Alder Hill and other Sierran basalt source locations. Kings Beach settlement systems appear to have been more circumscribed, confined to the Lake Tahoe Region and surrounding uplands and the lower-lying, eastern flanks of the Sierra Nevada in Carson Valley, Washoe Valley, Truckee Meadows, and Long Valley. ETHNOGRAPHY Prior to historic contact in the early to mid-1800s, the shores of Lake Tahoe were part of the vast territory held by the Washoe people. Washoe territory extended north to Honey Lake and south to the headwaters of the Tuolumne River. To the east, the valleys at the base of the Sierra were also Washoe territory. The boundary to the west was more fluid, involving shared use of the upper and lower western slopes with the Nisenan and Miwok. The primary sociopolitical group among the Washoe was the small extended family over which presided a family headman. Permanent villages were inhabited year-round, but most able-bodied adults and older children shifted their residence throughout the warmer seasons. A winter settlement would be home to several of these families, who shared a group identity but acted independently in most matters. While areas of settlement were rich in resources, they were relatively small oases within less-usable lands. This “patchiness” of the Washoe environment was best utilized by changing residence often to exploit resources in different zones as they became available, and by keeping populations sufficiently low to assure ample food for all members of the group. The Washoe regularly convened throughout the year to participate in rabbit drives and large-scale fowling and fishing activities, as well as to maintain family contacts. The American River and Lake Tahoe were major year-round fisheries with good locations for villages and camps, and the Martis Valley was an important gathering place to obtain edible and medicinal roots, seeds, and marsh plants. Washoe lifeways were not directly affected by the earliest historic-period activities in California and Nevada. However, by the 1850s and 1860s Washoe culture was affected by thousands of outsiders who had moved through their territory. Ranchers and other settlers restricted Washoe use of lands and resources. Although traditional settlement and subsistence practices were profoundly disrupted, many traditional customs persist among the Washoe people today.  HISTORY Early History—Lake Tahoe In 1844, John C. Frémont and his companion Charles Preuss recorded the first sighting of Lake Tahoe by Euro-Americans. Later that same year, members of the westward-bound Stevens-Murphy-Townsend party were likely the first Euro-Americans to venture onto the shore of the Lake. The California Gold Rush, centered mainly in the Sierra Nevada foothills, and the subsequent Comstock Lode silver rush that occurred a decade later in Nevada, drew thousands of miners and entrepreneurs through the Tahoe Sierra on their way to the mining locales. During this period, the Lake was known by various names, including Mountain Lake and Lake Bigler. It was officially designated Lake Tahoe by the California State Legislature in 1945. The proximity of the Tahoe Basin to the Mother Lode in California and the Comstock Lode in Nevada promoted related development in lumbering, grazing, transportation, market hunting and fishing, tourism, and urban development in the region to provide materials to meet the demand of those areas. Transportation In 1854, a popular movement to open up California resulted in legislation creating a trans-Sierra highway, named the Placerville-Lake Tahoe Road. This road was graded to a width of 12 feet and was cleared of all brush and rocks. The public pledged $50,000 to construct it and the road opened in 1858. One year later, the Comstock mining boom exploded in western Nevada and a rush of people and supplies to the mines near Virginia City resulted in a surge of wagon traffic from California into the Tahoe Basin. While the Carson Road over Carson Pass to the south was the most popular route, many traveled on the Placerville-Lake Tahoe Road. Determined unconstitutional by the California Supreme Court, the route was a series of private turnpikes, each maintained by its own toll operator who charged travelers for every person, wagon, and animal who passed over it. In 1863, 30,000 tons of freight and 56,500 people traveled the road. Given the challenging geography and heavy use, the road was expensive to maintain. In the higher elevations, toll companies spent up to $5,000 per mile for improvement and up to $3,000 for maintenance. Offsetting the high expense was the very lucrative revenue totaling over $3 million in 1862. Once in the Tahoe Basin, many freighters, stagecoach drivers, and Pony Express riders preferred a side road south of the Lake closely following modern-day Pioneer Trail. This alternate route was easier on mules, horses, and oxen, as the road was less sandy than the Placerville-Lake Tahoe Road near Bijou along the lakeshore. Maps from the 1860s through the 1940s depict Lake Tahoe Boulevard/US 50 and Pioneer Trail as major transportation routes. The Placerville-Lake Tahoe Road roughly paralleled modern day US 50. By 1950, the importance of US 50 as a major transportation route was established. With the end of the Comstock rush and subsequent economic depression in the 1870s, traffic on toll roads declined steadily to a point that most toll operators were gone by 1885. Due to general deterioration of the road and the economic necessity of a trans-Sierra route, El Dorado County assumed control of the road and designated the Placerville-Lake Tahoe Road a 65-mile section beginning at Smith’s Flat three miles east of Placerville to the Nevada state line. Six years later, overwhelmed by the high costs of keeping the road passable, El Dorado County deeded the road to the state in perpetuity. The state balked at the high costs of maintenance and in 1907 appropriated just $5,000 to complete the road and place milestones. These funds proved woefully inadequate.  With the advent of the automobile in the 20th century, the need for good roads became imperative. The passage of state road improvement bonds in 1910, 1916, and 1919 along with the Federal-Aid Road Act in 1916, provided the monetary means to finance a series of road improvement projects statewide, including routes into the Tahoe Basin. Previously, due to the inadequacy of the roads in the Tahoe Basin, most travelers to lakeshore resorts and cabins arrived at their destinations via steamer or sailboat departing from the Lake Tahoe Railway and Transportation Company’s depot at Tahoe Tavern. Finally, a road ringing Lake Tahoe, the Brockway Highway (State Route 28), was completed in 1931, enabling travelers to reach Nevada’s north shore of the lake and providing momentum to the development of that region. During the mid-1930s, a branch route, the Pioneer Route or Sierra Nevada Southern Route of the Lincoln Highway (modern US 50 through the project area), became the major automobile access to the Basin. As year-round recreational demands increased, all the roads connecting Lake Tahoe to Nevada and California had been paved by 1930, and by 1931, a passable auto route had been completed around the Lake. Industry Early development at the Lake was precipitated by the discovery of silver in 1859 at the Comstock Lode near Virginia City, Nevada. The rich forest reserves of the Lake Tahoe Basin were stripped to provide timber for the ever-deepening mine shafts around Virginia City and for the construction of homes and commercial enterprises in the surrounding communities. The rich placer diggings in the California gold country had been played out, and the area was experiencing a depression. Disillusioned gold miners seeking easy riches rushed to the Comstock strike, again passing by Lake Tahoe on their return route. While the major timber companies were located on the Nevada side of the Lake (the Carson and Tahoe Lumber and Fluming Company [CTLFC] at Glenbrook and the Sierra Nevada Wood and Lumber Company at Crystal Bay), other small operations were developed along the lake during the boom period between 1860 and the 1890s. Each developed an impressive network of mills, railroads, trams, flumes, and ponds designed to convey milled lumber over the Carson Range and down into the nearly treeless areas surrounding the Washoe mines. Along the South Shore, timber harvesting was marginal until 1880. Between Al Tahoe and Lapham’s Lake House (Stateline) only a few shacks owned by commercial fishermen were built. Logging activity in this area picked up dramatically as the timber stands on the northern and eastern shores were thinning out. The CTLFC built a railroad terminus near modern day Bijou and soon stripped lower Lake Valley of its marketable timber. By 1900, the forests had been logged out, the mills were closed, and the rail lines were removed. Settlement, Recreation, and Tourism During the Comstock days, rest houses and small hotels sprang up along the Placerville-Lake Tahoe Road. These hostelries and roadside inns such as Lake House (the present-day Al Tahoe community) and Lapham’s Hotel supported small farms and ranches in Lake Valley by supplying travelers with products such as fresh milk, eggs, beef, fish, and vegetables. Ranches supplied the hay, oats, and other fodder for horse and mule teams. After the logging operations diminished, the recreationists began to arrive. Beginning in the early 1860s, resorts had been established at Lake Tahoe as fashionable summer retreats for the well-to-do. Some of the earliest resorts on the California side of the Lake include the Lake House at Al Tahoe, Rubicon Point Lodge, Grand Hotel at Tahoe City, and the Bellevue Hotel at Sugar Pine Point. The first permanent settlements were at the mouth of McKinney Creek, Ward Creek, Glenbrook, and Tahoe City, where the Tahoe House was erected in 1864. When the Central Pacific Railroad reached Truckee, a wagon road was constructed to the Lake and the tourism boom began.  In 1899, Duane L. Bliss built the Lake Tahoe Railway and Transportation Company, a 15-mile narrow gauge railroad connecting the Central Pacific’s Truckee depot with the Bliss family’s Tahoe Tavern and lake side resort. This access also benefited South Shore resorts and developers as steamers from the Tahoe Tavern crossed the Lake. As a result, tourism further grew and additional resorts were constructed. Several of the other South Shore area resorts, like Bijou Park, Lapham’s, Row and Lake House, and Al Tahoe, boasted excellent swimming, clean beaches, horseback riding, hiking, and dancing to potential investors. Development continued at a moderate pace through the 1920s and slowed during the Great Depression. World War II brought residential development to a near standstill as materials, men, and resources were redirected to the war effort. After the war, the Region was readily accessible to a public clamoring to camp, build vacation cabins, and enjoy various recreation opportunities along the lakeshore. Two studies by the California Department of Public Health noted a 160 percent increase in summer visitors and a 90 percent increase in permanent residents between 1949 and 1959. Accompanying this increase in visitation, speculators, developers, and builders flocked to the Tahoe Basin at an unprecedented rate to meet the feverish demand for residential and associated commercial construction. A rapid growth in motel/hotel development also occurred during this time, reflecting trends elsewhere of these motels/hotels becoming part of the retreat and resort–like atmosphere. These architectural expressions of the automobile age steadily eroded the patronage of many of the earlier, pre-war lodges. Due to geographical constraints, there was a limited amount of space for a traditional stand-alone residential development. Faced with significant population growth as a result of Harvey’s and Harrah’s expansion and the growing number of service sector employees to staff them, area builders were compelled to construct more multi-unit apartment housing. The Tahoe Basin has seen increasing use during the winter months, especially since the development for the 1960 Winter Olympic Games and the subsequent boom in ski resort construction. The history of skiing in the basin began mildly in the 1920s when the Tahoe National Forest (TNF) partnered with developers to build small snow-parks and small ski resorts. Later in the 1930s, the TNF and the Sierra Club created trails for cross country skiers. Following World War II, studies were completed to develop recreational amenities for snow sports. Soon more than 50 snow sports facilities, some on lands leased from the Forest Service, were open and serving skiers and other snow recreational activities at new resorts at Donner Summit, Squaw Valley, Alpine Meadows, Sugar Bowl, Mount Rose, and, later, Heavenly Valley. Ski resort development was later curtailed by concerns over water pollution from increased muddy runoff emptying into the lake from logging to clear ski runs, resort-driven urbanization, construction of multi-unit housing for resort workers, and year-round automobile traffic in the basin. Advancements in road clearing technology kept roads open longer and minimized severe weather delays, resulting in more traffic. Small, family-oriented, rustic cabins gave way to year-round subdivisions and timeshares, wholesale remodeling, and demolition, as present-day residents increased the size and changed the use of their properties. Casinos Gambling in the Tahoe Basin dates to the early Comstock period as miners wagered their earnings in games of chance. Officially outlawed in California and mildly restricted in Nevada, gambling was nevertheless common on both sides of the border. Hotels and saloons offered games of chance to tourists, miners, and residents with little regard for punishment. This would change in 1958 with the election of San Francisco District Attorney Edmund G. “Pat” Brown to the California Governorship. Governor Brown took a hard line against gambling and began aggressively enforcing anti-gambling statutes. The anti-gambling position was adopted by subsequent governors and only began to soften in 1984 with the passage of the California State Lottery Act, which intended to raise money for schools without raising taxes. The rise of major casino developments such as Harvey’s and Harrah’s created a casino core which by 1990 employed one-third of the workers who lived in the City of South Lake Tahoe. Due to high land values and an aversion to high-density development, multi-unit apartments to house low-wage resort workers are limited in the City of South Lake Tahoe and Douglas County. As a result, many workers commute in from Carson City, Minden, and other outlying areas. RECORDS SEARCH NCIC Records Search Two confidential records searches for the California portion of the APE were conducted at the North Central Information Center (NCIC) on May 20, 2009, and September 21, 2011 (NCIC File #ELD-08-38 and #ELD-11-64). The searches included a review of the following documents and sources:  Directory of Properties in the Historic Property Data File (California Office of Historic Preservation February 5, 2009, and August 15, 2011). The directory includes the listings of the NRHP, National Historic Landmarks, and the CRHR;  California Historical Landmarks (California Office of Historic Preservation 1996);  California Points of Historical Interest (California Office of Historic Preservation 1992);  Five Views: An Ethnic Historic Site Survey for California (California Office of Historic Preservation 1988); and  California Inventory of Historic Resources (California Department of Parks and Recreation 1976). Archaeological Records The records search did not identify any prehistoric archaeological cultural resources in the California APE, but identified the following historic-period archaeological sites:  P-09-3866 is the reported site of Lakeside House (or Lapham House), a historic-period hotel that was constructed circa 1859, destroyed by fire in 1876, and rebuilt in 1892.  Built Environment Records The records search identified the following built-environment cultural resources in and adjacent to the California Architectural APE:  Cecil’s Market, a building formerly located on the corner of US 50 and Park Avenue.  Swiss Village Motel, a building formerly located at the intersection of US 50 and Pioneer Trail.  P-09-3257-H, Equestrian Complex in Van Sickle Bi-State Park, approximately 100 feet outside the APE.  P-09-3258-H, an unpaved road and sawed-off utility poles in Van Sickle Bi-State Park. The portion of the road within the APE is now a modern, asphalt-paved road with recent landscaping and modern signs.  P-09-809, a segment of the Pioneer Trail which does not appear eligible to the NRHP or CRHR due to alterations to its physical characteristics that have compromised its integrity.  The portion of US 50 within the APE is coterminous with the Lincoln Highway. US 50 is a modern highway and no longer retains any elements of the historic Lincoln Highway.  P-09-5091, NRHP-listed “Tahoe Meadows” planned community, adjacent to the APE. Nevada Cultural Resources Information System The background research for the Nevada portion of the APE included a records search of the online Nevada Cultural Resources Information System on December 28, 2011. The records search included the APE and a 500-foot buffer. On August 31, 2015, a supplementary records search was conducted, which included the APE and a 1-mile radius.  Archaeological Records The following archaeological cultural resources have been recorded in or adjacent to the Nevada portion of the Archaeological APE:   26 Do 36 is a small lithic scatter.  26 Do 4 was a bedrock mortar site but was resurveyed in 1993 and found to be destroyed.  USFS #5-19-434 and -435 are two bedrock mortar sites. Built Environment Records The following built-environment cultural resources are recorded within the Nevada Architectural APE:  Friday’s Station is a two-and-one-half story building constructed in 1860 as an inn and Pony Express Station. Friday’s Station was listed on the NRHP in 1986.  26 Do 726/KBG-3 is a short segment of unimproved roadway that connected 26Do 451/KBG-4 with SR 207.  26 Do 743 is an unimproved road situated in Van Sickle Bi-State Park.  26 Do 451/KBG-4 is a short segment of the former Lake Tahoe Wagon Road and Lincoln Highway.  Pony Express Rider statue and commemorative plaque outside Harrah’s Lake Tahoe Casino Hotel appears eligible for the NRHP. Native American Consultation The NAHC was contacted to request a search of its sacred lands file, along with contact information for Native American representatives who might have details about cultural resources in the project area. In its response, dated March 12, 2012, the NAHC stated that its search of the sacred lands file had failed to identify any Native American cultural resources in the immediate project area. The NAHC also provided a list of Native American representatives, recommending that these individuals be contacted for information regarding cultural resources.  On March 29, 2012, letters describing the project with a map depicting the APE were sent to each of the Native American individuals and organizations on the contact list provided by the NAHC, requesting any information or concerns they might have regarding cultural resources in the APE. Follow-up telephone calls were placed on April 13, 2012, after no response to the letters had been received. Only one individual, Mr. Darrel Cruz, Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO) of the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California, was able to be contacted. During an April 16, 2012, telephone conversation, Mr. Cruz stated that the project area has been disturbed by urban improvements, that he does not know of any cultural resources in the project area, and that the areas along creeks to the north of the project area are archaeologically sensitive. Mr. Cruz requested that the tribe be “kept involved” as the project progresses and stated that the tribe is available to monitor if archaeological testing or construction excavation takes place.  Additional Research and Consultation On February 22, 2012, letters describing the project with a map depicting the APE were sent to the North Lake Tahoe Historical Society in Tahoe City, the Lake Tahoe Historical Society in South Lake Tahoe, the Heritage Association of El Dorado County in Placerville, California, and the Douglas County Historical Society in Gardnerville, Nevada. The letters requested information or concerns regarding historical sites within the APE. No relevant information was obtained from these groups. The following inventories, publications, and maps were also reviewed to provide background information and to identify cultural resources in the APE:   Handbook of North American Indians: Washoe,  Handbook of the Indians of California,  Historic Spots in California,  California Place Names,  Tahoe Place Names,  Nevada Historical Markers,  Nevada Historical Marker Guidebook,  A Geographical Dictionary: Nevada Place Names,  Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks of San Francisco and Northern California,  General Land Office plats, and  Washoe Habitation Sites in the Lake Tahoe Area. A map in Washoe Habitation Sites in the Lake Tahoe Area depicts a Washoe site (identified as Site #34) in or near the APE. Site #34 is described as a bedrock mortar.  ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEYS Archaeologists conducted pedestrian surveys on August 31, 2011; November 22 and 23, 2013; and March 23, 2014. The undeveloped land east of US 50 and Lake Parkway was inspected using transects spaced 20 meters wide or less. Due to a lack of access, the Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course portion of the APE was surveyed from the fence along US 50 and the western segment of Lake Parkway. Ground visibility throughout the APE was limited to less than 10 percent due to grasses, landscaping, pavement, and, during the November survey, snow. Areas of bare soil were reviewed for indicators of archaeological deposits. Small areas of soil surface were periodically cleared of obstruction by trowel, and rodent holes, road cuts, and banks were examined for archaeological deposits. No evidence of resources P-09-3866 (the site of the Lakeside/Lapham House) or 26 Do 36 (a small lithic scatter) was identified during field surveys. The pedestrian survey did not identify any previously unrecorded archaeological resources within the APE. BUILT ENVIRONMENT SURVEYS Architectural historians surveyed and recorded built-environment cultural resources in the APE on August 19 and 20, 2010; May 28 and 29, 2014; and July 8 and 9, 2015. As a result of the built-environment surveys in California, 87 resources were evaluated for eligibility for the NRHP and the CRHR and for TRPA compliance. As a result of the built environment survey in Nevada, nine resources were evaluated for NRHP eligibility and for TRPA compliance. An additional resource identified in the APE is California Historical Landmark #728. The 3-foot tall, chrome-plated cylindrical monument is located on the south side of US 50 near the entrance to Harrah’s Casino. It bears the message “Friday’s Station – Overland Pony Express Route in California” and is situated where the former Pony Express route crossed the state line. Monuments and markers themselves are not eligible for NRHP listing, and the field review strongly suggests that the marker is less than 45 years. Therefore, the marker was not evaluated for NRHP eligibility and is not considered a resource for the purposes of CEQA, NEPA, or TRPA. SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES ON THE PROJECT SITE Friday’s Station Friday’s Station is a two-and-one-half story building located in the Nevada portion of the Architectural APE. It was constructed in 1860 as an inn and Pony Express Station. Because Friday’s Station is listed in the NRHP, it is historically significant for the purposes of NEPA and the TRPA Code for this project. 26 Do 451/KBG-4; Lincoln Highway/Lake Tahoe Wagon Road This archaeological resource is located in the Nevada portion of the Architectural APE and consists of a short segment of the former Lake Tahoe Wagon Road and Lincoln Highway built in 1863, and later became a segment of the Carson Branch of the Lincoln Highway, the first transcontinental automobile route in the United States. In a 2006 report, the segment appears eligible for inclusion in the National Register under Criterion A for its strong association with the themes of communication and transportation, and Criterion C for its qualities of construction. Therefore, it is historically significant for the purposes of NEPA and the TRPA Code of Ordinances for this project.  Pony Express Rider Statue In the Nevada portion of the Architectural APE, a bronze statue of a Pony Express Rider and commemorative plaque are located outside Harrah’s Lake Tahoe Casino Hotel, dedicated April 4, 1963. The Pony Express Rider statue was evaluated for this study and appears eligible for the NRHP under Criterion C for its aesthetic design qualities and association with sculptor Avard Fairbanks. It also meets the requirements of Criteria Consideration F: Commemorative Properties. Therefore, this resource is historically significant for the purposes of NEPA and the TRPA Code of Ordinances for this project. 3.8.3 Environmental Consequences METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS The impact analysis for cultural resources is based on the findings and recommendations provided in the project reports prepared by Caltrans and NDOT, as identified above. This section includes a joint NEPA/CEQA/TRPA analysis of impacts to cultural resources and evaluates impacts of the project alternatives using NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA criteria. The analysis included records searches, archival research, and pedestrian surveys, as described above. Friday’s Station, the Pony Express Rider statue, and site 26 Do 451 are Section 4(f) resources but no use of these resources would occur, which is documented in Appendix D, “Resources Evaluated Relative to the Requirements of Section 4(f) and Proposed De Minimis Determination.” SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA NEPA Criteria An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the locally preferred action. Under NEPA, the significance of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are encompassed by the CEQA criteria used for this analysis. No specific factors related to cultural resources are contained in NEPA, CEQ Regulations Implementing NEPA, or FHWA NEPA regulations in 23 CFR 771 et seq. TRPA Criteria The “Archaeological/Historical” criteria from the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist were used to evaluate the impacts of the alternatives for TRPA compliance. Impacts from the project would be significant if:   the proposal results in an alteration of or adverse physical or aesthetic effect to a significant archaeological or historical site, structure, object, or building;  the project is located on a property with any known cultural, historical, and/or archaeological resources, including resources on TRPA or other regulatory official maps or records;  the property is associated with any historically significant events and/or sites or persons; or   the proposal has the potential to cause a physical change which would affect unique ethnic cultural values. CEQA Criteria To determine whether environmental impacts to cultural resources are significant environmental effects, Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines asks whether a project would do any of the following:   cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource as defined in Section 15064.5 of the CEQA Guidelines;  cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of an archaeological resource pursuant to Section 15064.5 of the CEQA Guidelines;   disturb any human remains, including those interred outside of formal cemeteries; or  result in a substantial adverse change to tribal cultural resources.   ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF THE PROJECT ALTERNATIVES Impact 3.8-1: Change in the significance of historical resources The build alternatives would not affect the NRHP-listed Friday’s Station, NRHP-eligible Pony Express Rider statue, or NRHP-eligible site 26 Do 451/KBG-4. The build alternatives would not physically alter the resources, change the properties’ uses or physical features, or otherwise diminish those aspects of integrity that enable the resources to convey their historical significance. NEPA Environmental Consequences: No Adverse Effect for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; No Effect for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations: Less than Significant for Alternatives B, C, D, and E; No Impact for Alternative A Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Under the No Build Alternative, because no improvements would be made to US 50 there would be no impact on historical resources for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA.  For the purposes of NEPA, Alternative A would have no effect on historical resources.  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Alternative B transportation improvements would involve realignment of US 50 to the south of existing US 50 from just west of the Pioneer Trail intersection in California to Lake Parkway in Nevada. The new alignment would begin at a new Pioneer Trail intersection located to the west of the existing intersection, and proceed south along existing Moss Road. The new US 50 alignment would have four 11-foot-wide travel lanes and turn pockets at major intersections and driveways. Additionally, Stateline Avenue would be widened to one lane each direction with a two-way left-turn lane and sidewalks between existing US and Pine Boulevard. A pedestrian bridge would be constructed over the new US 50 alignment near the California/Nevada State Line connecting the Van Sickle Bi-State Park to the Stateline area. These elements would involve excavation, construction, grading, and paving. The cultural resources reports prepared for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project identified three resources (Friday’s Station, Pony Express Rider statue, and site 26 Do 451) as being eligible for or already listed in the NRHP. The project would not cause the physical destruction, alteration, or removal of these resources and would not change the character of the properties or cause their neglect, transfer, lease, or sale. With regard to criterion v of ACHP’s Criteria of Adverse Effect 36 CFR 800.5 (a)(2), the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project would introduce new visual elements (the construction of a new pedestrian bridge and transportation improvements); however, these project elements would not substantially degrade the existing visual, atmospheric, or auditory setting and would not diminish those aspects of integrity that enable the resources to convey their significance. In addition, Friday’s Station is visually separated from the project by a dense stand of trees and site 26 Do 451 (Lincoln Highway/Lake Tahoe Wagon Road) is visually separated from project improvements by a chain-link fence, boulders, vegetation, and trees. Alternative B transportation improvements would result in a less-than-significant impact on historical resources for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative B transportation improvements would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to historical resources such that there would be no adverse effect on historical resources. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. As discussed for Alternative B transportation improvements, the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for Alternative B would not cause the physical destruction, alteration, or removal of the identified resources and would not change the character of the properties or cause their neglect, transfer, lease, or sale. Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on historical resources for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to historical resources such that there would be no adverse effect on historical resources. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential effects on historical resources as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential effects on historical resources would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on historical resources. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative B would minimize the environmental consequences related to historical resources such that Alternative B would have no adverse effect on historical resources and no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Alternative C transportation improvements includes the project components described above under Alternative B, except that it would split eastbound and westbound directions on US 50 from the Pioneer Trail/US 50 intersection in California to the Lake Parkway/US 50 intersection in Nevada. Eastbound US 50 would remain in place as under Alternative A, while westbound US 50 would be realigned as described for Alternative B. The same resources described for Alternative B are present in the APE for Alternative C, and the effects of project activities would be the same as described above. Alternative C transportation improvements would result in a less-than-significant impact on historical resources for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative C transportation improvements would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to historical resources such that there would be no adverse effect on historical resources. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents.

However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential effects on historical resources would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on historical resources. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative C would minimize the environmental consequences related to historical resources such that Alternative C would have no adverse effect on historical resources and no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements Alternative D transportation improvements includes the project components described above under Alternative B; however, the new US 50 alignment would proceed east on a new roadway between existing Echo Road and Fern Road, instead of the existing Moss Road. The same resources described for Alternative B are present in the APE for Alternative D, and the effects of project activities would be the same as described above. Alternative D transportation improvements would result in a less-than-significant impact on historical resources for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative D transportation improvements would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to historical resources such that there would be no adverse effect on historical resources. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The same resources described for Alternative B are present in the APE for Alternative D, and the effects of project activities would be the same as described above. Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on historical resources for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to historical resources such that there would be no adverse effect on historical resources. Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential effects on historical resources as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential effects on historical resources would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in a less-than-significant impact on historical resources. For the purposes of NEPA, taken as a whole, the design features of the transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, as part of Alternative D would minimize the environmental consequences related to historical resources such that Alternative D would have no adverse effect on historical resources and no additional mitigation measures are needed or feasible to implement. Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E would involve construction of a concrete bridge over the entire width and length of the existing US 50 ROW between Stateline Avenue and the northern end of the Montbleu Resort that would serve pedestrians as a “skywalk” walkway along the tourist core near the resort-casinos. The skywalk would be accessible by escalators on both ends of the structure and elevators positioned at access points along the structure. Additionally, Stateline Avenue would be widened to include one lane each direction with a two-way left-turn lane and sidewalks between existing US 50 and Pine Boulevard. The same resources described for Alternative B are present in the APE for Alternative E, and the effects of project activities would be the same as described for Alternative B. Alternative E would result in a less-than-significant impact on historical resources for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, the design features of Alternative E would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to historical resources such that there would be no adverse effect on historical resources.   Impact 3.8-2: Disturb unique archaeological resources Construction and excavation activities associated with the build alternatives could result in sediment disturbance and removal, which can adversely affect archaeological resources. There are no known archaeological resources that would be damaged or destroyed by the build alternatives (Alternatives B, C, D, and E). Because Alternatives B, C, D, and E would include excavation and other ground-disturbing activities, these alternatives could result in adverse physical effects on unknown archaeological resources.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: Mitigation Measures 3.8-2a, 3.8-2b, and 3.8-2c have been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, D, and E to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to unknown archaeological resources such that there would be No Adverse Effect on unknown archaeological resources; The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize the environmental consequences related to known archaeological resources such that there would be No Effect on known archaeological resources; No Effect for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations: Less than Significant for Alternatives B, C, D, and E after implementation of Mitigation Measures 3.8-2a, 3.8-2b, and 3.8-2c; No Impact for Alternative A Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Under the No Build Alternative, no improvements would be made to US 50; therefore, there would be no impact on unique archaeological resources for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, Alternative A would have no effect on archaeological resources. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Alternative B transportation improvements would involve realignment of US 50 to the south of existing US 50 from just west of the Pioneer Trail intersection in California to Lake Parkway in Nevada. The new US 50 alignment would involve excavation, construction, grading, and paving.  The records search prepared for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project identified four archaeological resources located within the APE, one of which had been recorded as destroyed in 1993. An additional site was identified on a Washoe habitation site map. None of these sites had previously been determined eligible for listing in the NRHP or the CRHR. The pedestrian survey was unable to relocate the sites and did not identify any previously unrecorded archaeological resources within the APE. Ground-disturbing activities that would occur as part of Alternative B transportation improvements would not damage or destroy any known, unique archaeological resources and, thus, would have no effect on known unique archaeological resources, for the purposes of NEPA, and no impact on known unique archaeological resources for purposes of CEQA and TRPA. The cultural resources reports prepared for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project determined that the sensitivity of the APE for buried prehistoric archaeological deposits is low, given the extensive ground disturbance associated with urbanization that has taken place. Project construction activities could encounter previously undiscovered or unrecorded archaeological sites and materials during project-related preconstruction or construction-related ground disturbing activities. These activities could damage or destroy these archaeological resources. Because all of the elements in Alternative B transportation improvements would involve some level of ground-disturbing activities, unknown, unique archaeological resources could be damaged or destroyed and this impact would be potentially significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences to unknown archaeological resources such that there would be no adverse effect. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. There are no known, unique archaeological resources that would be disturbed by ground-disturbing activities as part of Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing. This alternative would have no effect on known unique archaeological resources, for the purposes of NEPA, and no impact on known unique archaeological resources for purposes of CEQA and TRPA. As discussed for Alternative B transportation improvements, the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, construction could encounter previously undiscovered or unrecorded archaeological sites and materials during project-related pre-construction or construction-related ground-disturbing activities. These activities could damage or destroy these archaeological resources. Because all of the elements in Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would involve some level of ground-disturbing activities, unknown, unique archaeological resources could be damaged or destroyed and this impact would be potentially significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences to unknown archaeological resources such that there would be no adverse effect.  Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential for effects on known and unknown archaeological resources as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential effects on known and unknown archaeological resources would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would result in a potentially significant impact on unknown archaeological resources. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into Alternative B transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences to unknown archaeological resources such that there would be no adverse effect. Alternative C: Triangle One-Way Transportation Improvements Alternative C transportation improvements includes the project components described above under Alternative B, except that it would split eastbound and westbound directions on US 50 from the Pioneer Trail/US 50 intersection in California to the Lake Parkway/US 50 intersection in Nevada. Eastbound US 50 would remain in place as under Alternative A, while westbound US 50 would be realigned as described for Alternative B. Construction activities would occur at the same locations as under Alternative B; therefore, the same types and magnitude of physical activities and ground disturbance would occur. For the same reasons described above for Alternative B, this alternative would have no effect on known unique archaeological resources, for the purposes of NEPA, and no impact on known unique archaeological resources for purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because all of the elements in Alternative C transportation improvements would involve some level of ground-disturbing activities, unknown, unique archaeological resources could be damaged or destroyed and this impact would be potentially significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the Alternative C transportation improvements to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences to unknown archaeological resources such that there would be no adverse effect. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative C would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”). If replacement housing is not constructed at any of these sites, then TTD would construct replacement housing at another location in the South Shore area to be determined prior to displacing any residents. This alternative includes the option for three mixed-use redevelopment sites, which could include replacement housing for displaced residents as well as other commercial uses (e.g., retail, restaurant). Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. The same type and magnitude of project elements would be constructed as described under Alternative B. For the same reasons described above for Alternative B, this alternative would have no effect on known unique archaeological resources, for the purposes of NEPA, and no impact on known unique archaeological resources for purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because all of the elements in Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would involve some level of ground-disturbing activities, unknown, unique archaeological resources could be damaged or destroyed and this impact would be potentially significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences to unknown archaeological resources such that there would be no adverse effect.  Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential for effects on known and unknown archaeological resources as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential effects on known and unknown archaeological resources would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would result in a potentially significant impact on unknown archaeological resources. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into Alternative C transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences to unknown archaeological resources such that there would be no adverse effect. Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Transportation Improvements Alternative D transportation improvements includes the project components described above for Alternative B; however, the new US 50 alignment would proceed east on a new roadway between existing Echo Road and Fern Road, instead of the existing Moss Road. Construction activities would occur at the same locations as under Alternative B but on different local roads in the neighborhood west of the Heavenly Village shopping center; therefore, the same types and magnitude of physical activities and ground disturbance would occur. For the same reasons described above for Alternative B, this alternative would have no effect on known unique archaeological resources, for the purposes of NEPA, and no impact on known unique archaeological resources for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because all of the elements in Alternative D transportation improvements would involve some level of ground-disturbing activities, unknown, unique archaeological resources could be damaged or destroyed and this impact would be potentially significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the Alternative D transportation improvements to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences to unknown archaeological resources such that there would be no adverse effect. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative D would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

For the same reasons described above for Alternative B, this alternative would have no effect on known unique archaeological resources, for the purposes of NEPA, and no impact on known unique archaeological resources for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because all of the elements in Alternative D with mixed-use development would involve some level of ground-disturbing activities, unknown, unique archaeological resources could be damaged or destroyed and this impact would be potentially significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences to unknown archaeological resources such that there would be no adverse effect.  Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential for effects on known and unknown archaeological resources as described for the mixed-use development sites. However, because the location of replacement housing elsewhere is unknown, analysis of the potential effects on known and unknown archaeological resources would be speculative at this time. Full, project-level environmental review of replacement housing somewhere other than the mixed-use development sites would be required prior to construction of replacement housing and displacement of existing residents. Conclusion For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, taken as a whole, the Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, at one or more of the mixed-use development sites would result in a potentially significant impact on unknown archaeological resources. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into Alternative D transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences to unknown archaeological resources such that there would be no adverse effect. Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E would involve construction of a concrete bridge over the entire width and length of existing US 50 between Stateline Avenue and the northern end of the Montbleu Resort that would serve pedestrians as a “skywalk” walkway along the tourist core. Construction activities would be limited to these areas in the same locations as under Alternative B; therefore, the same types of physical activities and ground disturbance would occur. For the same reasons described above for Alternative B, this alternative would have no effect on known unique archaeological resources, for the purposes of NEPA, and no impact on known unique archaeological resources for purposes of CEQA and TRPA. With implementation of Alternative E, unknown unique archaeological resources could be damaged or destroyed and this impact would be potentially significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the Alternative E transportation improvements to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences to unknown archaeological resources such that there would be no adverse effect. Impact 3.8-3: Accidental discovery of human remains Construction and excavation activities associated with development activities may result in sediment disturbance and removal, which can unearth human remains if they are present. Because the project would allow excavation and other ground-disturbing activities, adverse physical effects on undiscovered or unrecorded human remains could occur. NEPA Environmental Consequences: Mitigation Measure 3.8-3 has been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, D, and E to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to disturbance of undiscovered or unrecorded human remains; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations: Less than Significant for Alternatives B, C, D, and E after implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.8-3; No Impact for Alternative A Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Because no improvements would occur under the No Build Alternative, there would be no construction-related ground disturbance and, therefore, no impact on undiscovered or unrecorded human remains for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Alternative B transportation improvements would result in realignment of US 50 to the south of existing US 50 from just west of the Pioneer Trail intersection in California to Lake Parkway in Nevada. The new US 50 alignment would involve large amounts of excavation, construction, grading, and paving.  Based on documentary research, no evidence suggests that any prehistoric or historic-era marked or unmarked human interments are present within or in the immediate vicinity of the APE. However, there is a possibility that unmarked, previously unknown Native American or other graves could be present within the APE and could be uncovered by project-related construction activities. The location of grave sites and Native American remains can occur outside of identified cemeteries or burial sites. As with archaeological resources, disturbance of human remains is more likely to occur in previously undisturbed and undeveloped areas where excavation and ground-disturbing activities have not already resulted in discovery. However, human remains may be discovered in developed and disturbed areas, as well, and may also be of recent origin. Because all of the elements in Alternative B transportation improvements would involve some level of ground disturbing activities, human remains could be damaged or destroyed. This impact would be potentially significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to disturbance of undiscovered or unrecorded human remains. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. As discussed under Alternative B transportation improvements, construction activities for Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, could encounter previously undiscovered or unrecorded human remains during project-related pre-construction or construction-related ground-disturbing activities. These activities could damage or destroy these remains. Because all of the elements in Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would involve some level of ground disturbing activities, human remains could be damaged or destroyed. This impact would be potentially significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to disturbance of undiscovered or unrecorded human remains.  Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential for effects related to disturbance of undiscovered or unrecorded human remains as described for the mixed-use development sites.

Eastbound US 50 would remain in place as under Alternative A, while westbound US 50 would be realigned onto a new alignment. Construction activities would occur at the same locations as under Alternative B; therefore, the same types and magnitude of physical activities and ground disturbance would occur. Because all of the elements in Alternative C transportation improvements would involve some level of ground disturbing activities, human remains could be damaged or destroyed.

Construction activities would be limited to these areas and in the same locations as under Alternative B; therefore, the same types of physical activities and ground disturbance would occur.

There are no known tribal cultural resources that would be damaged or destroyed by Alternatives B, C, D, and E. Because Alternatives B, C, D, and E would include excavation and other ground-disturbing activities, these alternatives could result in adverse physical effects on unknown tribal cultural resources.  NEPA Environmental Consequences: Mitigation Measures 3.8-4a and 3.8-4b have been incorporated into Alternatives B, C, D, and E to further reduce to the extent feasible environmental consequences related to unknown tribal cultural resources; The design features of Alternatives B, C, D, and E would avoid or minimize environmental consequences related to known tribal cultural resources; No Impact for Alternative A CEQA/TRPA Impact Determinations:  Less than Significant for Alternatives B, C, D, and E after implementation of Mitigation Measures 3.8-4a and 3.8-4b; No Impact for Alternative A Alternative A: No Build (No Project) Under the No Build Alternative, no improvements would be made to US 50; therefore, there would be no impact on tribal cultural resources for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Transportation Improvements Alternative B transportation improvements would involve realignment of US 50 to the south of existing US 50 from just west of the Pioneer Trail intersection in California to Lake Parkway in Nevada. The new US 50 alignment would involve excavation, construction, grading, and paving.  Tribal cultural resources can include objects with cultural values to a California Native American tribe that are either included in the California Register of Historic Places, eligible for the register, or included on a local register. The records search prepared for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project identified four archaeological resources located within the APE, one of which had been recorded as destroyed in 1993. An additional site was identified on a Washoe habitation site map. None of these sites had previously been determined eligible for listing in the NRHP or the CRHR. The pedestrian survey was unable to relocate the sites and did not identify any previously unrecorded archaeological resources within the APE. Tribal cultural resources can also include sites, features, places, cultural landscapes, and sacred places with cultural values to a California Native American tribe. As discussed above, in consultation with the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California, no cultural resources, including unique ethnic values or religious or sacred uses, are located in the project site. Furthermore, the project site has been highly disturbed by urbanization. For these reasons, ground-disturbing activities that would occur as part of Alternative B transportation improvements would not damage or destroy any known tribal cultural resources and, thus, would have no impact on known tribal cultural resources for purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. The cultural resources reports prepared for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project determined that the sensitivity of the APE for buried prehistoric archaeological deposits is low, given the extensive ground disturbance associated with urbanization that has taken place. Because tribal cultural resources can include archaeological resources, the results of the cultural resources reports also indicate a low likelihood for the presence of tribal cultural resources. Project construction activities could encounter previously undiscovered or unrecorded tribal cultural resources during project-related preconstruction or construction-related ground disturbing activities. These activities could damage or destroy these tribal cultural resources. Because all of the elements in Alternative B transportation improvements would involve some level of ground-disturbing activities, unknown tribal cultural resources could be damaged or destroyed and this impact would be potentially significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the transportation improvements included in Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to disturbance of unknown tribal cultural resources. Mixed-Use Development including Replacement Housing Prior to displacing existing residents, Alternative B would construct replacement housing along with supporting commercial uses that could be located at one or more of three mixed-use development sites identified within the project site (see Exhibits 2-9 and 2-11 in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives”).

Use of one or more of these three sites, or at another location in the South Shore area for replacement housing, would require additional parcel acquisitions beyond that required for the transportation improvements. There are no known tribal cultural resources that would be disturbed by ground-disturbing activities as part of Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing. This alternative would have no impact on known tribal cultural resources for purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. As discussed for Alternative B transportation improvements, the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, construction could encounter previously undiscovered or unrecorded tribal cultural sites and materials during project-related pre-construction or construction-related ground-disturbing activities. These activities could damage or destroy these tribal cultural resources. Because all of the elements in Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would involve some level of ground-disturbing activities, unknown tribal cultural resources could be damaged or destroyed and this impact would be potentially significant for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. For the purposes of NEPA, additional mitigation measures have been incorporated into the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for Alternative B to further reduce to the extent feasible the environmental consequences related to disturbance of unknown tribal cultural resources.  Construction of replacement housing at a location other than the three mixed-use development sites could result in similar potential for effects related to disturbance of unknown tribal cultural resources as described for the mixed-use development sites.

The fence shall be installed from the entrance to Friday’s Station on US 50 to a point 400 feet east of the Johnson’s Cut-Off/Pony Express Trail/Lincoln Highway segment. A sign shall be installed at the east end of the fence to exclude construction personnel access from the area behind the fence. The fence shall be installed in coordination with a qualified archaeologist prior to ground-disturbing activities and shall remain in place until after the project has been completed. The condition of the fence shall be monitored periodically during the course of construction by the archaeologist who supervised its installation. Mitigation Measure 3.8-2b: Conduct archaeological monitoring The following mitigation was included in the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS, which included the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project as one of the TTD Capital Improvement Program projects in the RTP. This mitigation would apply to transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for Alternatives B, C, and D, and Alternative E for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. In accordance with existing regulations, for ground-disturbing activities that have the potential to impact archaeological remains and that will occur in an area that has been determined by a qualified archaeologist to be sensitive (locations where previous disturbance has not occurred) for the presence of buried archaeological remains, the project proponent (e.g., TTD, local county, Caltrans, NDOT) shall require the construction contractor to retain a qualified archaeologist to monitor those activities. Archaeological monitoring shall be conducted in areas where there is likelihood that archaeological remains may be discovered but where those remains are not visible on the surface. Monitoring will not be considered a substitute for efforts to identify and evaluate cultural resources prior to project initiation. Where necessary, the project proponent shall seek Native American input and consultation. Mitigation Measure 3.8-2c: Stop work in the event of an archaeological discovery The following mitigation was included in the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS, which included the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project as one of the TTD Capital Improvement Program projects in the RTP. This mitigation would apply to transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for Alternatives B, C, and D, and Alternative E for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  If potentially significant cultural resources are discovered during ground-disturbing activities associated with individual project preparation, construction, or completion, the project proponent shall require the construction contractor to stop work in that area until a qualified archaeologist can assess the significance of the find, and, if necessary, develop appropriate treatment measures in consultation with TRPA and other appropriate agencies and interested parties. A qualified archaeologist shall follow accepted professional standards in recording any find including submittal of the standard Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) Primary Record forms (Form DPR 523) and location information to the California Historical Resources Information Center office (North Central Information Center) for California projects. The consulting archaeologist shall also evaluate such resources for significance per California Register of Historical Resources eligibility criteria (PRC Section 5024.1; Title 14 CCR Section 4852) for California projects. Consultation with the Nevada State Historic Preservation Officer shall be undertaken for Nevada projects. If the archaeologist determines that the find does not meet the TRPA standards of significance for cultural resources, construction may proceed. If the archaeologist determines that further information is needed to evaluate significance, the lead agency shall be notified and a data recovery plan shall be prepared. Significance after Mitigation Implementation of Mitigation Measures 3.8-2a, 3.8-2b, and 3.8-2c would reduce potentially significant impacts on archaeological resources because mitigation would be developed and implemented in coordination with the appropriate federal, state, and/or local agency(ies) to avoid, move, record, or otherwise treat the resource appropriately, in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations. By providing an opportunity to avoid disturbance, disruption, or destruction of archaeological resources, Impact 3.8-2 would be reduced to a less-than-significant level for all build alternatives for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the environmental consequences of implementing the build alternatives with Mitigation Measures 3.8-2a, 3.8-2b, and 3.8-2c would not be adverse. Mitigation Measure 3.8-3: Stop work if human remains are discovered The following mitigation was included in the RTP/SCS EIR/EIS, which included the U.S. 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project as one of the TTD Capital Improvement Program projects in the RTP. This mitigation would apply to transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for Alternatives B, C, and D, and Alternative E for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. In accordance with existing regulations, if any human remains are discovered or recognized in any location on an individual project site, the project proponent will ensure that there will be no further excavation or disturbance of the site or any nearby area reasonably suspected to overlie adjacent human remains until: a) The applicable County Coroner/Sheriff has been informed and has determined that no investigation of the cause of death is required; and b) If the remains are of Native American origin, 1. The descendants of the deceased Native Americans have made a recommendation to the landowner or the person responsible for the excavation work, for the means of treating or disposing of, with appropriate dignity, the human remains and any associated grave goods as provided in Public Resources Code Section 5097.98, or 2. The Native American Heritage Commission was unable to identify a descendant or the descendant failed to make a recommendation within 24 hours after being notified by the commission. 3. The site shall be flagged and avoided during construction. c)  If human remains, grave goods, or items of cultural patrimony (as defined in the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act [NAGPRA]) are discovered during ground-disturbing activities on Federal Property, work will cease until the provisions of NAGPRA are met. Significance after Mitigation Implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.8-3 would reduce potentially significant impacts on human remains because mitigation would be developed in coordination with the appropriate federal, state, and/or local agency(ies) to avoid, excavate, or otherwise treat the remains appropriately, in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations. By providing an opportunity to avoid disturbance, disruption, or destruction of human remains, Impact 3.8-3 would be reduced to a less-than-significant level for all build alternatives for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the environmental consequences of implementing the build alternatives with Mitigation Measure 3.8-3 would not be adverse. Mitigation Measure 3.8-4a: Conduct tribal cultural resources monitoring This mitigation would apply to transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for Alternatives B, C, and D, and Alternative E for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA. In accordance with existing regulations, for ground-disturbing activities that have the potential to impact tribal cultural resources, such as archaeological remains, and that will occur in an area that has been determined by a qualified archaeologist to be sensitive (locations where previous disturbance has not occurred) for the presence of buried tribal cultural resource remains, the project proponent (e.g., TTD, local county, Caltrans, NDOT) shall require the construction contractor to retain a qualified archaeologist to monitor those activities. Archaeological monitoring shall be conducted in areas where there is likelihood that tribal cultural resources, such as archaeological remains, may be discovered but where those remains are not visible on the surface. Monitoring will not be considered a substitute for efforts to identify and evaluate tribal cultural resources prior to project initiation. Where necessary, the project proponent shall seek Native American input and consultation. Mitigation Measure 3.8-4b: Stop work in the event of a tribal cultural resource discovery This mitigation would apply to transportation improvements and mixed-use development, including replacement housing, for Alternatives B, C, and D, and Alternative E for the purposes of NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA.  If potentially significant tribal cultural resources are discovered during ground-disturbing activities associated with individual project preparation, construction, or completion, the project proponent shall require the construction contractor to stop work in that area until a qualified archaeologist can assess the significance of the find, and, if necessary, develop appropriate treatment measures in consultation with TRPA and other appropriate agencies and interested parties. A qualified archaeologist shall follow accepted professional standards in recording any find including submittal of the standard DPR Primary Record forms (Form DPR 523) and location information to the California Historical Resources Information Center office (North Central Information Center) for California projects. The consulting archaeologist shall also evaluate such resources for significance per California Register of Historical Resources eligibility criteria (PRC Section 5024.1; Title 14 CCR Section 4852). Consultation with the Nevada State Historic Preservation Officer and the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California shall be undertaken for the portions of the project within Nevada. Consultation with the California Native American Heritage Commission and the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California shall be undertaken for the portions of the project in California. If the archaeologist, in consultation with the Nevada State Historic Preservation Officer, California Native American Heritage Commission, and Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California, determines that the find does not meet the PRC Section 21074 definition for tribal cultural resources, then construction may proceed. If the archaeologist determines that further information is needed to evaluate significance, the lead agency shall be notified and a data recovery plan shall be prepared. Significance after Mitigation Implementation of Mitigation Measures 3.8-4a and 3.8-4b would reduce potentially significant impacts on tribal cultural resources because mitigation would be developed and implemented in coordination with the appropriate federal, state, and/or local agency(ies) to avoid, move, record, or otherwise treat the resource appropriately, in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations. By providing an opportunity to avoid disturbance, disruption, or destruction of tribal cultural resources, Impact 3.8-4 would be reduced to a less-than-significant level for all build alternatives for the purposes of CEQA and TRPA. Because of the reasons stated above, for the purposes of NEPA, the environmental consequences of implementing the build alternatives with Mitigation Measures 3.8-4a and 3.8-4b would not be adverse. 4 OTHER NEPA-, CEQA-, AND TRPA-MANDATED SECTIONS 4.1 EFFECTS FOUND NOT TO BE SIGNIFICANT As part of the scoping and environmental analysis carried out for the project and as discussed in Chapter 3, the build alternatives would result in no adverse impacts for the purposes of CEQA, TRPA, and NEPA related to the following environmental issue areas and, therefore, they do not warrant further evaluation.  Agricultural resources. According to the California Department of Conservation (DOC), there are no lands considered to be important farmland on the project site (DOC 2014) or lands subject to Williamson Act contracts (DOC 2016). There are also no agricultural land easements in the project site designated by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resource Conservation Service (NCRS) under the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program. Thus, the project alternatives would not convert important farmland, conflict with Williamson Act contracts, or otherwise affect agricultural land. There would be no impacts related to agricultural resources.  New parks and recreation facilities. The project alternatives would not construct new recreation facilities and, thus, would not result in an impact related to creating additional recreation capacity, conflicts between recreation uses, or creating an adverse physical effect on the environment associated with construction of recreation facilities.   Interfere with waterborne, rail traffic, or air traffic. No alternative would result in increasing, creating, or interfering with waterborne, rail traffic, or air traffic.   Hazards due to roadway design. None of the build alternatives would install sharp curves or dangerous intersections, or result in incompatible uses of roadways, such as by slow-moving farm equipment.   Paleontological resources. A review of the Geologic Map of the Lake Tahoe Basin (Saucedo 2005) indicates that the Area of Potential Effect (APE) is located within an area of cretaceous age (145 to 66 million years old) granodiorite and Pleistocene age (2.6 million to 11,700 years old) lake terrace deposits. Small pockets Holocene (11,700 years ago to present) alluvium and floodplain deposits can be found near streams.  The value or importance of different fossil groups varies depending on the age and depositional environment of the rock unit that contains the fossils, their rarity, the extent to which they have already been identified and documented, and the ability to recover similar materials under more controlled conditions (such as for a research project). Marine invertebrates are generally common; the fossil record is well developed and well documented, and generally they would not be considered a unique paleontological resource. Identified vertebrate marine and terrestrial fossils are generally considered scientifically important because they are relatively rare. Some invertebrate fossils have been found on the south shore of Lake Tahoe; however, there are no documented occurrences of vertebrate fossils within the Lake Tahoe Basin (U.C. Berkeley Museum of Paleontology [UCMP] 2017).  A review of the UCMP database indicates there are no recorded fossil sites in the vicinity of the study area (UCMP 2017). The majority of the study area has been heavily influenced by the Pleistocene era glaciations, which scoured the mountain slopes; mixing, and transported granitic and volcanic debris, and further minimizing the potential for fossils to be present in these locations. Isolated remnants of ancient, metamorphosed sedimentary seafloor deposits exist within the Lake Tahoe Basin but do not occur within the study area (Saucedo 2005). The metamorphosed remnant located closest to the study area is found approximately 2.5 miles to the north east at Castle Rock, near Daggett Pass. For these reasons, none of the alternatives would result in an adverse effect on unique paleontological resources.  Geology, soils, land capability and coverage. The study area does not contain expansive soils or slopes that could become unstable or generate landslides or avalanche. Additionally, TRPA regulations prohibit the construction of septic tanks or wastewater disposal systems within the Lake Tahoe Basin.   Avalanche hazards. The project site does not contain areas with a high risk of avalanche.  Mineral resources. Impacts on mineral resources (loss of a known mineral resource or a locally-important mineral resource recovery site) were dismissed from further evaluation, because there are no known mineral resources within the project site (USGS 2015) and because mining is not an identified allowable use in the study area by the Tourist Core Area Plan or Douglas County Code Section 20. 703.090 and 20.703.130 (City of South Lake Tahoe 2013:C-2 – C-12).  Vector-borne disease. The US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project does not include treatment wetlands or detention basins of sufficient capacity that could influence vector-borne disease risks. Therefore, there would not be hazards associated with increased potential for vector-borne disease as a result of the project.  Airports. The build alternatives are not located close enough to a public airport or a private airstrip to create a conflict or safety hazard. The Lake Tahoe Airport is located approximately 4 miles southwest of the project site. The Minden-Tahoe Airport is located over 9 miles east of the project site. The nearest private airstrip (Bailey Ranch) is located north of Carson City and over 9 miles east of the project site. The project site is not within the designated approach or departure routes of any airports or airstrips. Because the location of the project site is distant from the nearest public or private airstrip or heliport, it would not result in an airport safety hazard for people residing or working at the project site.  Hazardous materials near schools. The build alternatives are not located within 0.25 mile of an existing or proposed school. Bijou Community School is located over 1 mile southwest of the project site. Zephyr Cove Elementary School and Whittell High School are located over 1 mile northeast of the project site. Therefore, implementation of the build alternatives would not emit or handle hazardous materials, substances, or wastes within 0.25 mile of an existing or proposed school.  Naturally-occurring asbestos. Asbestos is the common name for a group of naturally-occurring fibrous silicate minerals that can separate into thin but strong and durable fibers. Naturally-Occurring Asbestos (NOA) is located in many parts of California and is commonly associated with serpentine soils and rocks. The asbestos map of western El Dorado County (Asbestos Review Areas, Western Slope, County of El Dorado, State of California; El Dorado County 2005) shows the location of individual parcels and areas considered to be subject to elevated risk of containing NOA. The project site is not located within any of the areas known to contain NOA.  Odors. Minor odors from the routine use of heavy duty diesel equipment and the laying of asphalt during construction activities would be intermittent and temporary, and would dissipate rapidly from the source with an increase in distance. Construction-related odors would be considered temporary and minor. Land uses that are major sources of odor typically include wastewater treatment and pumping facilities, sanitary landfills, transfer stations, recycling and composting facilities, and various industrial uses such as chemical manufacturing and food processing. There are no major odor sources adjacent to or in the immediate vicinity of the project site. Further, El Dorado County Air Quality Management District Rule 205-Nuisance is in place to protect citizens from harmful odors should they occur. Therefore, project implementation would not create objectionable.  New stationary sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to transportation improvements. No new stationary sources of GHG emissions would be constructed as part of the build alternatives.   Conflicts with a habitat conservation plan. None of the build alternatives would be constructed within an area covered under an adopted habitat conservation Plan, natural community conservation plan, or other approved local, regional, or state conservation plan. Therefore, project implementation would not conflict with the provisions of an adopted conservation plan.   Special-status species. Section 3.16.2, “Affected Environment,” discusses the special-status plant and animal species evaluated in this EIR/EIS/EIS, and Tables M-1 and M-2 (Appendix M) summarize the potential for each of these species to occur in the study area. Generally, those plant and animal species not expected to occur, or with a low probability to occur (because of a lack of suitable habitat, existing disturbance levels, or lack of occurrence records) are not addressed in detail, because implementation of the build alternatives would not be expected to affect those species.  Wildlife movement or migratory corridors. The study area is not positioned within any known important wildlife movement or migratory corridors. Because the study area is subject to high levels of human disturbance and isolation of habitat patches because of commercial and residential development, presence of major road corridors, and recreational uses, it is not likely to function as an important corridor. 4.2 SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS THAT CANNOT BE AVOIDED Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 40 Section 1502.16 and Section 5.8.B (2) of the TRPA Code of Ordinances requires an EIS to include any significant adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should any of the alternatives be implemented. CEQA Section 21100(b)(2)(A) states that an EIR shall include a detailed statement setting forth “[i]n a separate section…[a]ny significant effect on the environment that cannot be avoided if the project is implemented.” State CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.2(b) requires that an EIR describe any significant impacts, including those that can be mitigated but not reduced to a less-than-significant level. Chapter 3, “Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences,” of this EIR/EIS/EIS addresses the potential environmental effects of the project alternatives and recommends mitigation measures, as necessary, to mitigate project effects to the extent feasible. For the purposes of CEQA and TRPA, the analysis concludes that all of the alternatives, including the alternative that involves taking no action (Alternative A) would result in significant and unavoidable impacts, or adverse effects, as described below.   Alternative A would result in five significant and unavoidable or adverse traffic and transportation effects, including impacts related to: vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian safety; intersection level of service (LOS); and roadway LOS and emergency access in future years (2040).   Alternative B would result in up to three significant and unavoidable or adverse effects. The Alternative B transportation improvements would result in impacts related to: dividing the Rocky Point neighborhood and the resultant effects on community character and cohesion; substantial noise increases; and visual effects on the Rocky Point neighborhood. Alternative B transportation improvements would also have a disproportionately high and adverse effect on minority and low-income populations in the Rocky Point neighborhood. The Alternative B mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in significant and unavoidable or adverse effects related to noise.  Alternative C would result in up to seven significant and unavoidable or adverse effects. The Alternative C transportation improvements would result in impacts related to: dividing the Rocky Point neighborhood and the resultant effects on community character and cohesion; substantial noise increases; visual effects on the Rocky Point neighborhood; and transportation effects, including emergency access and roadway LOS. Alternative C transportation improvements would also have a disproportionately high and adverse effect on minority and low-income populations in the Rocky Point neighborhood. The Alternative C mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in significant and unavoidable or adverse effects related to noise and traffic.  Alternative D would result in up to three significant and unavoidable or adverse effects. The Alternative D transportation improvements would result in impacts related to: dividing the Rocky Point neighborhood and the resultant effects on community character and cohesion; substantial noise increases; and visual effects on the Rocky Point neighborhood. Alternative D transportation improvements would also have a disproportionately high and adverse effect on minority and low-income populations in the Rocky Point neighborhood. The Alternative D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in significant and unavoidable or adverse effects related to noise.  Alternative E would result in up to five significant and unavoidable or adverse effects, including impacts related to: construction activities that would generate noise during nighttime noise-sensitive hours; a construction-related vibration impact on adjacent buildings; a decrease in the travel route rating for Roadway Travel Unit #32, and degradation of the scenic quality of the immediate area; and scenic impacts from the elevated structure having the potential to block or disrupt scenic vistas or views of individual scenic resources. 4.3 GROWTH-INDUCING IMPACTS 4.3.1 National Environmental Policy Act The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations, which established the steps necessary to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, require evaluation of the potential environmental effects of all proposed federal activities and programs. This provision includes a requirement to examine indirect effects, which may occur in areas beyond the immediate influence of a proposed action and at some time in the future. The CEQ regulations (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 1508.8) refer to these consequences as indirect impacts. Indirect impacts may include changes in land use, economic vitality, and population density, which are all elements of growth.  4.3.2 Tahoe Regional Planning Agency Section 3.7.2(H) of the TRPA Code of Ordinances requires that an EIS evaluate the growth-inducing impacts of a project. Growth can be induced by eliminating obstacles to growth or by stimulating economic activity in a way that encourages increases in population and housing in the region.  4.3.3 California Environmental Quality Act CEQA Section 21000(b)(5) specifies that growth-inducing impacts of a project must be addressed in an EIR. Section 15126(d) of the CEQA Guidelines states that a project is growth-inducing if it could “foster economic or population growth, or the construction of additional housing, either directly or indirectly, in the surrounding environment.” Included in the definition are projects that would remove obstacles to population growth. Examples of growth-inducing actions include developing water, wastewater, fire, or other types of services in previously unserved areas; extending transportation routes into previously undeveloped areas; and establishing major new employment opportunities. Typically, the growth-inducing potential of a project would be considered significant if it fosters growth or a concentration of population above what is assumed in local and regional land use plans, or in projections made by regional planning authorities. Significant growth impacts could also occur if the project provides infrastructure or service capacity to accommodate growth levels beyond those permitted by local or regional plans and policies. 4.3.4 Growth-Inducing Effects A project is considered to be growth-inducing if it fosters economic or population growth, directly or indirectly, in the surrounding environment. These impacts could result from projects that include housing construction or the removal of an obstacle to growth, such as expansion of a wastewater treatment plant, extending transportation routes into previously undeveloped areas; and establishing major new employment opportunities.  Development in the Tahoe Region is guided by the Regional Plan, which allows new development and redevelopment through authorization of residential allocations, commercial floor area, tourist accommodation units, and residential bonus units. As a result, development is capped in the Region and implementation of capital improvement projects, such as the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project would not result in an increase in the planned development patterns in the Region. The roadway features included in Alternatives B, C, D, and E are intended to enhance the current transportation network and mobility opportunities. Because existing roads would be utilized for transportation improvements associated with these alternatives, accessibility within the study area would not change such that they could influence growth. The Tahoe Region is virtually built out; therefore, the project does not propose the expansion of existing transportation or transit routes, which would remove obstacles to growth in the Region and influence growth through additional housing, population, and economic growth beyond that planned for in the Regional Plan. Section 3.4, “Community Impacts,” discusses reasonably foreseeable population and employment growth associated with Alternatives B, C, D, and E. Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements and mixed-use development would include construction of replacement housing equal to the number of housing units displaced by the project. Because these replacement housing units would result in no net loss of housing, meaning that the project would neither result in an increase in the number of housing units or a decrease in the number of housing units in the study area, these alternatives would not influence growth.  Alternatives B, C, and D with mixed-use development would result in localized growth of residential and commercial uses that is planned for in the Regional Plan. This development would be subject to the commodities system set forth by the Regional Plan that distributes a limited number of residential and commercial floor area (CFA) allocations. Such growth would generate additional traffic, noise, air pollutant emissions, and the need for additional public services and utilities. The effects of this growth are assessed in the resource sections of this EIR/EIS/EIS. Alternatives B, C, and D proposes new mixed-use development, which would result in implementing growth planned for by the Regional Plan and TCAP. Construction of the project transportation improvements and potential mixed-use development would generate temporary demand for construction employees, which would be anticipated to be met by existing residents in the South Shore area or nearby areas (e.g., Minden, Gardnerville, Carson City) and would not be anticipated to indirectly cause population growth as described in Impact 3.4-2. Furthermore, there would be a potential incremental increase in permanent road maintenance work and a permanent increase in demand for commercial employees associated with the potential mixed-use development, which would also be anticipated to be met by the local workforce as described in Impact 3.4-3. For these reasons, the incremental increase in employment that could occur with the project would not result in an increase in the population that was not previously planned by the Regional Plan. Construction employment demand during implementation of the project would not influence growth. In addition, while the transportation improvements associated with Alternatives B, C, D, and E could require relocation of existing utilities, they would not propose any new or substantially expanded public services or utilities. The mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would require the extension of utilities to serve the new development, but would not increase the capacity of the utilities and, thus, would not induce growth beyond that planned for by the project, the TCAP, SSAP, and the Regional Plan. For these reasons, substantial indirect growth-inducement would not occur from implementation of the project. 4.4 ENVIRONMENTALLY SUPERIOR ALTERNATIVE CEQA calls for the identification of an environmentally superior alternative in an EIR, but gives no definition for the term (State CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(e)). However, CEQA does specify that if the environmentally superior alternative is the “no project” alternative, the EIR shall also identify an environmentally superior alternative among the other alternatives. From the standpoint of minimizing environmental effects related to physical disturbances, Alternative A (No Build Alternative) would be the environmentally preferable/environmentally superior alternative. With Alternative A, no construction would take place and operations and maintenance would continue under existing programs, and there would not be substantial changes to the existing environment. However, Alternative A would not meet any of the basic project objectives described in Section 1.3, “Purpose, Need, and Objectives,” and would not achieve the water quality, bicycle and pedestrian, transit, greenhouse gas emission, and visual benefits of Alternatives B, C, and D. Implementing Alternative A would also preclude gaining the environmental and economic revitalization benefits of the build alternatives.  Table 4-1 identifies the number of significant, potentially significant, and beneficial impacts identified under each action alternative for each environmental issue area evaluated in this EIR/EIS/EIS. The significance of impacts and identification of adverse impacts, for the purposes of NEPA, after mitigation is also identified. As shown in Table 4-1, based solely on impact significance conclusions after implementation of mitigation measures, all of the alternatives evaluated in this EIR/EIS/EIS would result in significant and unavoidable impacts. All of the build alternatives would also provide beneficial effects.  The US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project is proposed to include a community revitalization component. It is included in the Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan (RTP, also known as Mobility 2035) and Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS, for the California portion of the Lake Tahoe Region) adopted in 2012 and TRPA’s Environmental Improvement Program (EIP). Consistent with the Regional Plan Goals and Policies, the EIP is designed to attain, maintain, or surpass multiple environmental thresholds through an integrated approach. Each build alternative was designed with these considerations in mind, and would contribute to various environmental improvements as described throughout this EIR/EIS/EIS.  The 2017 Regional Transportation Plan (2017 RTP), which is an update to the 2012 RTP, and its joint CEQA/TRPA environmental document have been circulated for public review. The vision and goals of the 2017 RTP were based on the 2012 RTP. The projects listed in the 2017 RTP are substantially similar to those in the 2012 RTP, and the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project is included in both documents. As shown in Table 4-1, there are significant and unavoidable impacts related to implementation of all build alternatives. Alternatives B and D have 11 beneficial impacts from the transportation improvements and six beneficial impacts from the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, chiefly related to traffic conditions along road segments and at intersections that would result from project implementation. Alternative C would similarly result in a high number of beneficial impacts (10 beneficial impacts from the transportation improvements and five beneficial impacts from the mixed-use development, including replacement housing); however, there are seven significant and unavoidable impacts from the transportation improvements and two significant and unavoidable impacts from the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, again chiefly related to traffic conditions that could not be mitigated with the current proposed mitigation measures. Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would also have a disproportionately high and adverse effect on minority and low-income populations in the Rocky Point neighborhood. Alternative A, the no build alternative, would result in five significant impacts (all of which relate to traffic conditions), none of which would be resolved. Table 4-1 Summary of Adverse Impacts (for the Purposes of NEPA) or Significant Impacts (for the Purposes of CEQA and TRPA) Before and After Mitigation  Environmental Topic  Alternative A  Alternative B  Alternative C  Alternative D  Alternative E  Transportation Improvements  Mixed Use Dev, Incl Replacement Housing  Transportation Improvements  Mixed Use Dev, Incl Replacement Housing  Transportation Improvements  Mixed Use Dev, Incl Replacement Housing  Before  After  Before  After  Before  After  Before  After  Before  After  Before  After  Before  After  Before  After  Land Use  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  Parks and Recreational Facilities  0  0  1B 1S  1B  1S  0  1B 1S  1B  1S  0  1B 1S  1B  0  0  1S  0  Community Impacts  0  0  1S  1Adv 1SU  0  0  1S  1Adv 1SU  0  0  1S  1Adv 1SU  0  0  0  0  Public Services and Utilities  0  0  1PS  0  2PS  0  1PS  0  2PS  0  1PS  0  2PS  0  1PS  0  Traffic and Transportation  5S  5Adv 5SU  9B  9B  5B 2S 1PS  5B  8B 6S  8B  4Adv 4SU  4B 3S 1PS  4B 1Adv 1SU  9B  9B  5B 2S 1PS  5B  9B 1S  9B 1Adv 1SU  Visual Resources/Aesthetics  0  0  1S 1PS  1Adv 1SU  0  0  1S 1PS  1Adv 1SU  0  0  1S 1PS  1Adv 1SU  0  0  2S  2Adv 2SU  Cultural Resources  0  0  1Adv 3PS  0  1Adv 3PS  0  1Adv 3PS  0  1Adv 3PS  0  1Adv 3PS  0  1Adv 3PS  0  1Adv 3PS  0  Floodplains  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  Water Quality and Stormwater Runoff  0  0  1B 1S  1B  1B 1S  1B  1B 1S  1B  1B 1S  1B  1B 1S  1B  1B 1S  1B  0  0  Geology, Soils, Land Capability and Coverage  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  Hazards, Hazardous Materials, and Risk of Upset  0  0  1PS  0  1PS  0  1PS  0  1PS  0  1PS  0  1PS  0  1PS  0  Air Quality  0  0  1S  0  1S  0  1S  0  1S  0  1S  0  1S  0  1S  0  Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  Noise and Vibration  0  0  2S  1Adv 1SU  1PS 1S  1Adv 1SU  2S  1Adv 1SU  1PS 1S  1Adv 1SU  2S   1Adv 1SU  1S 1PS  1Adv 1SU  3S  2Adv 2SU  Biological Environment  0  0  3PS  0  3PS  0  3PS  0  3PS  0  3PS  0  3PS  0  0  0  Total  5Adv 5S  5Adv 5SU  11B 1Adv 7S 9PS  11B 3Adv 3SU  6B 1Adv 6S 11PS  6B 1Adv 1SU  10B 1Adv 13S 9PS  10B 7Adv 7SU  5B 1Adv 6S 11PS  5B 2Adv 2SU  11B 1Adv 7S 9PS  11B 3Adv 3SU  6B 1Adv 5S 11PS  6B 1Adv 1SU  9B 1Adv 8S 5PS  9B 5Adv 5SU  Note: Adv = Adverse Impact; PS = Potentially Significant Impact, S = Significant Impact, B = Beneficial Impact, 0 = No Adverse Effects (NEPA)/Significant Impacts (CEQA/TRPA); SU = Significant and Unavoidable Impact Source: Compiled by Ascent Environmental, Inc. in 2016   Alternatives B, C, and D would meet all of the project objectives and would all cause long-term significant and unavoidable impacts. Alternatives A and E would eliminate many significant impacts associated with the transportation improvements proposed under Alternatives B, C, and D, in particular the long-term effects of a realigned roadway through residential neighborhoods. However, the benefits related to realigning US 50 would not be realized with Alternatives A and E, including those involving improved emergency access and traffic conditions. Additionally, Alternative E would result in significant scenic and visual degradation of the roadway and roadway viewpoints. Thus, for the purposes of this analysis, the discussion of environmentally superior alternatives focuses on Alternatives B, C, and D.  The environmental differences between Alternatives B, C, and D are related to project design. All of these alternatives include replacement housing and a mixed-use development option intended to replace the lost residential, retail, and commercial space from acquired parcels. Each of these alternatives would provide benefits to the study area associated with traffic operations, mobility, emergency services, visual resources (as they relate to the current scenic resources identified by TRPA), and water quality impacts. The environmental effects of Alternatives B and D are similar, with variations in land acquisition and the particular resultant land use geography, but not to the extent that significance conclusions are substantially different.  In conclusion, the environmentally superior alternative would be either Alternative B or D transportation improvements, including replacement housing and the mixed-use development option, depending on decisions about the priority of types of environmental benefits and adverse effects by the lead agencies. Both of these alternatives would result in fewer long-term, significant and unavoidable environmental impacts and would provide substantial benefits to the study area. The environmental impact differences between these alternatives are not substantial enough that one is clearly superior over the other. 4.5 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION ACT (SECTION 4[f] AND PROPOSED DE MINIMIS DETERMINATION)  Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 states that a transportation program or project requiring the use of publicly owned land of a public park, recreation area, or wildlife and waterfowl refuge of national, state, or local significance can be approved only if there is no prudent and feasible alternative to using that land and if the program or project includes all possible planning to minimize harm resulting from the use to the park, recreation area, wildlife and waterfowl refuge, or historic site.  A Proposed De Minimis Finding is included as Appendix D of this Draft EIR/EIS/EIS, which includes preliminary findings regarding the use of Section 4(f) resources located within the study area that include:   Public Parks and Recreation Areas  Van Sickle Bi-State Park, managed by the California Tahoe Conservancy (Conservancy) and Nevada Division of State Parks (NSP)  Wildlife/Waterfowl Refuges  Public access to the TRPA-designated waterfowl management area located at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course  Historic Properties Listed or Eligible for the National Register of Historic Places  Friday’s Station (National Register Inventory #86003259)  Pony Express Rider Statue  Lincoln Highway/Lake Tahoe Wagon Road/26 Do 451/KBG-4 4.5.1 Section 4(f) De Minimis Findings PARKS, RECREATION AREAS, AND REFUGES A description of existing park and recreation facilities and resources in the study area, including Van Sickle Bi-State Park, is included in Section 3.3, “Parks and Recreation Facilities.” A determination of de minimis impact on parks, recreation areas, and wildlife and waterfowl refuges, may be made when all three of the following criteria are satisfied: 1. The transportation use of the Section 4(f) resource, together with any impact avoidance, minimization, and mitigation or enhancement measures incorporated into the project, does not adversely affect the activities, features, and attributes that qualify the resource for protection under Section 4(f). Preliminary Finding: As described herein, the small amount of parkland to be permanently incorporated into the project right-of-way would be less than 0.1 percent of the acreage of the Van Sickle Bi-State Park. Additionally, potential impacts of the project related to visual resources and noise would not adversely affect the activities, features, and attributes that qualify the resource for protection under Section 4(f).  The project would result in beneficial effects related to public access and connectivity between the tourist/casino core and the park, which would be enhanced through:  Improved signage, paths and trails for bicycles and pedestrians,   Intersection improvements at Heavenly Village Way,   A signalized crosswalk at Heavenly Village Way, and   The construction of a connecting path and pedestrian bridge over the new US 50. 2. The public has been afforded an opportunity to review and comment on the effects of the project on the protected activities, features, and attributes of the Section 4(f) resource. Preliminary Finding: This preliminary finding will be released and made available for public comment for a period of 60 days, concurrent with the public comment period for the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS. FHWA will consider all comments on the proposed de minimis impact finding prior to issuing a final finding. 3. The official(s) with jurisdiction over the property are informed of FHWA’s intent to make the de minimis impact determination based on their written concurrence that the project will not adversely affect the activities, features, and attributes that qualify the property for protection under Section 4(f). Preliminary Finding: TTD and FHWA consulted with and informed the Conservancy and NSP of the proposed de minimis impact finding proposed to be made by FHWA. After the public comment period ends and if Alternatives B, C, or D is selected as the preferred alternative, FHWA would seek written concurrence from the Conservancy and NSP that the project would not adversely affect the activities, features, and attributes that qualify the resource for protection under Section 4(f). Based on the preliminary findings to date, Alternatives B, C, and D would result in a proposed de minimis impact on Van Sickle Bi-State Park. OTHER RESOURCES EVALUATED RELATIVE TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 4(F) Appendix D includes analysis of wildlife/waterfowl refuges, which includes Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course, and historic properties listed or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, which includes Friday’s Station (National Register Inventory #86003259), Pony Express Rider Statue, and Lincoln Highway/Lake Tahoe Wagon Road/26 Do 451/KBG-4. These resources are evaluated relative to the requirements of Section 4(f). Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course does not have a permanent public property interest as a wildlife or waterfowl refuge; therefore, the Edgewood Golf Course property does not qualify as this category of Section 4(f) resource. With respect to the historic properties, the project would not result in an adverse physical change to these resources and, thus, there would be no use of these resources for the purposes of Section 4(f). 4.6 ECONOMIC EFFECTS Section 1508.14 of the CEQ regulations states that economic or social effects are not intended by themselves to require preparation of an EIS but that when an EIS is prepared and economic or social and natural or physical environmental effects are interrelated, then the document should discuss all of these effects on the human environment. Economic impacts of transportation projects include the effects of the project on factors such as personal and business income, employment, property values, and tax revenues. Transportation projects can have both positive and negative effects on local and regional economies. Section 3.4, “Community Impacts,” of this EIR/EIS/EIS addresses displacement of businesses and effects on employment as a result of the project. The primary sources of information used in preparing this section are the Economic Analysis of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project (TTD 2013) and US 50 Realignment Municipal Tax Revenue Analysis Draft Memorandum (Walker, pers. comm., 2016). This section provides background information about economic conditions in the vicinity of the project site.  4.6.1 Affected Environment ECONOMY AND EMPLOYMENT Please see discussion of the South Shore economy, types of employment, and employment rate in Section 3.4.1. The types of businesses described below for the study area are representative of the majority of employment in the South Shore area that relies heavily on tourism and visitor services. Study Area Sub-Districts The study area contains of the following sub-districts that would most likely realize direct effects from the project.  Commercial triangle west of the existing US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection. The commercial triangle at this location consists of three parcels containing the following businesses:  Subway   Taco Taqueria   7 Eleven   Powder House    Vinny’s Pizza   Tahoe Bottle Shop   the Alpaca Store  Heavenly Village Center (formerly the “Crescent V”). The Heavenly Village Center is a community shopping center consisting of approximately 150,000 square feet of commercial space anchored by a Raley’s Supermarket. Currently, the rear portion of the property accommodates public parking for a fee. The Heavenly Village Center underwent redevelopment in the late 1990s and early 2000s, which led to construction of new commercial space and revitalization of existing buildings. Heavenly Village. The 17-acre Heavenly Village was created through a comprehensive redevelopment effort undertaken by the city and a variety of other stakeholders. Heavenly Village is characterized as a lively, outdoor, walkable shopping district anchored by the Heavenly gondola and two Marriott fractional/timeshare properties known as the Timber Lodge and Grand Residence Club. Other types of businesses in the Heavenly Village include restaurants, apparel stores, tourist-oriented retailers, and a movie theater. A parking garage is also located in Heavenly Village. Construction of Heavenly Village was completed in 2006.  Chateau at the Village. The first phase of the Chateau was completed in 2014 and includes an anchor restaurant and retail stores. The second phase of the Chateau is in progress and will include tourist accommodations and mixed retail uses referred to as the Zalanta development. Resort-casinos. The resort-casino portion of the tourist core consists of four major casino properties (Harrah’s Lake Tahoe; Harvey’s Lake Tahoe; Montbleu Resort, Casino, and Spa; and Hard Rock Hotel and Casino), which provide gaming and entertainment facilities, more than 2,000 hotel rooms, and 45,000 square feet of retail/commercial space. Other US 50 commercial. Aside from the two major shopping centers, the US 50 corridor near the state line accommodates a modest amount of commercial uses, including a gas station, convenience store, equipment rental, tourist-related retail shops, a lodging facility, and restaurants.  Tourism and Recreation Despite the Region’s heavy reliance on tourism and recreation, performance statistics for these sectors have shown relatively poor results in the South Shore over the past decade. Lodging trends. The lodging industry in South Shore has experienced substantial difficulties in the past 10 years or so. The number of annual rooms rented has declined from 1.1 million in 2001/2002 to 720,000 in 2009/2010. The number of rooms rented showed slight improvements in 2010/2011 and 2011/2012. Additionally, occupancy and average daily rates in South Shore lodgings are significantly lower than those observed in other tourism areas in California and similar mountain resort towns in Utah and Colorado. While other resort towns in California, and California overall, saw an increase in transit occupancy tax (TOT) revenues from 2001 to 2011, TOT revenues declined by over 50 percent (TTD 2013:13 – 15). Gaming revenues. Gaming has historically been a major driver of visitation to the South Shore. Since the proliferation of legalized gaming in California and the national recession that began in 2007, gaming revenues saw a decrease of more than 40 percent between 2007 and 2011 (TTD 2013:17). Skier visits. In spite of challenging economic periods during the last decade, the number of annual skier visits remained steady at Lake Tahoe ski resorts. Skier visitation in Lake Tahoe is known to be closely linked with weather patterns, including both ski conditions and roadway conditions, which likely explain the high degree of variability in the number of annual skier visits. Despite this variability in skier visitation around the Basin, Lake Tahoe’s ski resorts remain a popular attraction and are known for their high-quality and diverse skiable terrain as well as their relatively easy access for a population base on several million people within a 3- to 4-hour drive. In addition, local ski resorts have continued to upgrade the quality and variety of their offerings in recent years, including the gondola and Tamarack Lodge at Heavenly Mountain Resort. Heavenly Mountain Resort is also expanding summer on-mountain activities, which is intended to boost year-round visitation and associated employment opportunities (TTD 2013:17 – 18). Retail Trends Retail sales are an important component of economic activity and employment in the South Shore. The retail sector of the South Shore economy has also been challenged in the past few years with annual retail sales just in the City of South Lake Tahoe declining by 19 percent between 2005 and 2012 (TTD 2013:18).  National trends in retail development in recent years have tended to be less auto-oriented and have moved towards outdoor, walkable districts that offer a variety of shopping and dining options that appeal to all demographic and socioeconomic groups as well as small venues for public performances. In the South Shore, much of the retail building supply (especially in areas outside of the study area) is old and of marginal quality, and new retail development activity has been minimal for many years. While some of the South Shore’s neighborhood shopping centers have been redeveloped or repositioned, the Heavenly Village has been the only large-scale new retail product built in the South Shore area over the past 30 years. This area has been extremely successful, commands very high lease rates (as compared to other areas of the South Shore), and attracts many visitors and local residents. The grocery-anchored Heavenly Village Center located next to (and benefitting from synergy with) the Heavenly Village also is a successful retail center that commands strong lease rates, occupancy levels above 95 percent, and caters to a healthy mix of local residents and visitors. Newly constructed or rehabilitated retail product in these primary shopping locations are performing much better on the South Shore than the aging retail stock in other areas of the city and unincorporated areas (TTD 2013:18 – 19). Best Practices The economic study identified a number of best practices that have contributed to the successful redevelopment of tourism-oriented mountain/resort communities that could be implemented in the South Shore (TTD 2013:19 – 22). Some of these best practices include:  Providing a complete range of dining, shopping, recreational, and entertainment options.  Creating town centers that develop a center of activity and energy that can serve surrounding residential neighborhoods as well as the visitor population.  Redevelopment of older resorts. Planners, policy makers, and business leaders in aging resort areas such as the South Shore must work especially hard to upgrade facilities and attractions, create new and exciting events, and implement marketing strategies to raise the profile of the area in hopes of remaining competitive. Without an updated and enhanced product to market, South Shore will continue to be classified and perceived as an “older resort.”  Offering a variety of upscale accommodations, fine dining, shopping, and other attractions to entice visitors.  Maintaining community identity and sense of place. Planners, policy makers, business owners, and community advocates must work to maintain the unique charm that brings visitors to a resort community.   Public transit options. A free or enhanced transit service to connect residents and visitors to destinations within town to help improve the tourism experience and appeal to visitors that are not familiar with navigating the area and appeal to visitors’ expectations for level of transit service.  Affordable housing. Ensure sufficient housing options are available to families and households of all income levels to ensure a viable class of middle income residents as well as clean and safe housing (and reliable transit connections) for lower income service-sector employees.  4.6.2 Economic Effects of the Project  METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS The primary economic impact of a transportation project on businesses is a change in the level of business activity. The following are some of the factors that can influence business activity. These factors are each discussed below:  Changes in  access to the business  traffic patterns, both locally and regionally  the environment near the business (e.g., noise level, air quality, or aesthetics)  property values  Loss of  available parking  tax revenue Tax Revenues The analysis of property tax revenues and sales tax revenues below are based on the US 50 Realignment Municipal Tax Revenue Analysis prepared by Jesse Walker of New Economics (2016).  Business Activity The analysis of changes in business activity below are based on key trends in retail and tourism development that may be influenced by the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project. It should be noted that while it is not practical to quantify the exact economic and financial impact of a roadway realignment project because of the numerous variables and unforeseen circumstances involved, the economic study conducted a thorough evaluation of the South Shore in an effort to understand the variables that would affect the economic influence of the project, under defined conditions, to frame the likely short- and long-term implications of the project. The economic study looked at the current and historical conditions prevalent in the South Shore to identify the community’s economic drivers and performance trends and its competitive position as a regional, national, and international tourism destination. The analysis included outreach to national and local experts, including local business representatives (TTD 2013:1).  The effects of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project on displacement of businesses are assessed in Impact 3.4-5 in Section 3.4, “Community Impacts.” The changes in employment that would result from implementation of the project is discussed in Impact 3.4-3. For these reasons, these issues are not discussed further here. CHANGE IN PROPERTY TAX, SALES TAX, AND TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX REVENUES Because Alternatives A and E would not acquire any property and would not result in any direct losses of tax revenues, Alternatives A and E would have no impact on property tax, sales tax, and transient occupancy tax revenues and are not discussed further for these alternatives.  None of the build alternatives would displace commercial businesses or hotel/motels in Nevada, there would be no loss of sales tax or transient occupancy tax (TOT) revenues in Douglas County, Nevada. Alternatives B, C, and D Transportation Improvements As discussed in Impacts 3.4-4 and 3.4-5 in Section 3.4, “Community Impacts,” implementation of Alternatives B transportation improvements would result in the removal of a number of residences and several businesses and hotel/motels within the California portion of the project site. In addition to full acquisition of parcels, the transportation improvements would require partial acquisition of parcels in California and Nevada. These partial and full parcel acquisitions required for the project would result in changes to property tax, sales tax, and TOT revenues. Property Tax Revenues Alternatives B, C and D transportation improvements would have an effect on the assessed value (AV) of properties within and around the realigned highway and repurposed “main street” district. In California, a general tax rate of 1 percent (plus any applicable voter-approved overrides) is levied annually upon the AV of taxable properties. This revenue is then distributed to the various local agencies that provide public services, such as the City of South Lake Tahoe and the fire department. During the period in which properties are held under the same ownership, a limit of 2 percent per year is placed on the appreciation of assessed (taxable) value. However, when the property changes hands through a sale or other similar transaction, the property is reassessed to the value at which the property is sold, or at a fair market value.  In order to determine the project’s impact on property taxes to local agencies, the US 50 Realignment Municipal Tax Revenue Analysis memo analyzed the net effect upon the AV of properties directly associated with the project (Walker, pers. comm., 2016:2). Note that this estimate does not quantify the actual amount of property tax revenues that would be generated, but instead simply measures the taxable basis upon which property taxes would be levied to determine whether the taxable basis would go up or down and by what order of magnitude.  The amount of land that would be removed from property tax rolls from full and partial acquisitions in California and Nevada are shown in Table 4-2 for each of the build alternatives. The build alternatives would result in the loss of between approximately 9 and 10.5 acres of land in California and approximately 2 to 4 acres of land in Nevada. The assessed value (AV) of property removed from tax rolls by the build alternatives would range between approximately $11 million and $14.4 million in California and approximately $1.6 million and $1.9 million in Nevada (see Table 4-3). In Fiscal-Year 2014-15, the City of South Lake Tahoe received approximately $6.2 million in property taxes, based on a total assessed value of $4.1 billion (Walker, pers. comm., 2016:3). The assessed value of the land removed from the tax roll from the build alternatives would represent 0.3 to 0.4 percent of the assessed value of property in the city’s tax roll. Because the amount of land removed from the tax roll in Nevada would be less than the amount removed in California, the loss of property taxes in Douglas County would be estimated to be an even smaller proportion of the county’s property taxes compared to the loss in the City of South Lake Tahoe. For these reasons, Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would result in a very small (less than 1 percent) reduction in the amount of land in the city’s and county’s tax rolls. Table 4-2 Acres of Land Acquired for the Transportation Improvements  Land Use  Full Acquisition1  Partial Acquisition – California  Partial Acquisition – Nevada  Total Acres  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action)   Commercial   0.00  0.75  0.58  1.33  Lodging  2.20  0.14  0.00  2.34  Residential  3.53  0.15  0.09  3.77  Vacant  2.43  1.15  2.93  6.51  Total Acres  8.16  2.19  3.60  13.95  Alternative C: Triangle One-Way  Commercial   0.00  0.18  0.68  0.86  Lodging  2.20  0.03  0.00  2.23  Residential  3.42  0.05  0.11  3.58  Vacant  2.37  0.77  1.41  4.55  Total Acres  7.99  1.03  2.20  11.22  Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2  Commercial   0.63  0.88  0.61  2.12  Lodging  0.55  0.13  0.00  0.68  Residential  3.03  0.00  0.20  3.23  Vacant  1.82  2.64  2.94  7.40  Total Acres  6.03  3.65  3.75  13.43  Note: No land would be acquired for Alternatives A and E and, therefore, are not included in this table. 1 The project would not result in full acquisition of any parcels in Nevada. Source: Compiled by Ascent Environmental in 2016   Table 4-3 Estimated Assessed Value of Property Removed from Tax Rolls for Transportation Improvements  Land Use  Value (dollars per acre)  Full Acquisition1 (dollars)  Partial Acquisition – California (dollars)  Partial Acquisition – Nevada (dollars)  Total Assessed Value (dollars)  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action)  Commercial   1,900,000  0  1,425,000  1,102,000  2,527,000  Lodging  2,000,000  4,400,000  280,000  0  4,680,000  Residential  2,150,000  7,589,500  322,500  193,500  8,105,500  Vacant  100,000  243,000  115,000  293,000  651,000  Total Assessed Value  NA  12,232,500  2,142,500  1,588,500  15,963,500  Alternative C: Triangle One-Way  Commercial   1,900,000  0  342,000  1,292,000  1,634,000  Lodging  2,000,000  4,400,000  60,000  0  4,460,000  Residential  2,150,000  7,353,000  107,500  236,500  7,697,000  Vacant  100,000  237,000  77,000  141,000  455,000  Total Assessed Value  NA  11,990,000  586,500  1,669,500  14,246,000  Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2  Commercial   1,900,000  1,197,000  1,672,000  1,159,000  4,028,000  Lodging  2,000,000  1,100,000  260,000  0  1,360,000  Residential  2,150,000  6,514,500  0  430,000  6,944,500  Vacant  100,000  182,000  264,000  294,000  740,000  Total Assessed Value  NA  8,993,500  2,196,000  1,883,000  13,072,500  NA = not applicable  1 The project would not result in full acquisition of any parcels in Nevada. Source: Adapted from Walker, pers. comm., 2016  Sales Tax Revenues The right-of-way required for Alternatives B and C would not displace any commercial buildings (see Table 4-4); therefore, transportation improvements for these alternatives would not result in a direct loss of retail sales and sales tax revenues for the City of South Lake Tahoe. The right-of-way required for Alternative D would displace 7,620 square feet of commercial buildings (see Table 4-6); therefore, the Alternative D transportation improvements would result in a direct loss of retail sales and sales tax revenues for the City of South Lake Tahoe. Table 4-4 Changes to Commercial Building Space    Alternatives B and C  (square feet)  Alternative D (square feet)  Transportation Improvements  Commercial Space to be Removed1  0  7,620  New Commercial Development  0  0  Total Change in Commercial Development (+ = increase/- = decrease)  0  -7,620  Table 4-4 Changes to Commercial Building Space    Alternatives B and C  (square feet)  Alternative D (square feet)  Mixed-Use Development  Commercial Space to be Removed2  11,700  4,080  New Commercial Development      Site 1  28,250  18,000  Site 2  8,000  20,000  Site 3  10,000  10,000  Total New Commercial Development  46,250  48,000  Total Change in Commercial Development (+ = increase/- = decrease)  34,550  36,300  1 Commercial businesses displaced by Alternative D transportation improvements include Powder House, Vinny’s Pizza, the Naked Fish, Tahoe Bottle Shop, and the Alpaca store (APNs 029-170-04 and 029-170-05). 2 Commercial businesses displaced by Alternatives B and mixed-use development include Subway, Taco Taqueria, 7 Eleven, Powder House, Vinny’s Pizza, the Naked Fish, Tahoe Bottle Shop, and the Alpaca store (APNs 029-170-03, 029-170-04, and 029-170-05). Additional businesses displaced by Alternative D mixed-use development include Subway, Taco Taqueria, 7 Eleven (APN 029-170-03). Source: Adapted from Walker, pers. comm., 2016; County of El Dorado 2016  Transient Occupancy Tax Revenues Implementation of transportation improvements for Alternatives B, C, and D would displace several hotel/motels, including between 41 tourist accommodation units (TAUs; Alternative D) and 114 TAUs (Alternatives B and C). As discussed in Impact 3.4-4 in Section 3.4, “Community Impacts,” some of the hotel/motel units in the National 9 Inn, South Shore Inn, Traveler’s Inn, and Elizabeth Lodge include some SRO units that are not required to pay TOT. There are 7,026 TAUs in the city (City of South Lake Tahoe and TRPA 2015:39). Although the build alternatives would result in loss of TOT revenues for the city, the number of TAUs displaced by the project represent less than 2 percent of the available TAUs that operate in the city; therefore, the loss of TOT revenues from hotel/motels displaced by the project would not be substantial. Conclusion Only the transportation improvements for Alternative D would result in the loss of sales tax revenues. The three build alternatives would result in the loss of a very small proportion of TOT revenues from displacing between 41 and 114 TAUs, some of which are used as SRO units and do not pay TOT. Because there are over 7,000 TAUs in the city, the loss of TOT revenues from up to 114 TAUs would not be considered substantial. This alternative would result in the loss of property tax revenue from acquisition of land for the build alternatives. However, as described above, the proportion of property tax revenue received from these properties of the overall city and county property tax revenue would be very small. This loss of property tax revenue would not be anticipated to interfere with the city’s or county’s ability to provide public services. For these reasons, Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would not have an adverse effect on property tax, sales tax, and transient occupancy tax revenues. Alternatives B, C, and D Mixed-Use Development, Including Replacement Housing Property Tax Revenues The amount of land that would be removed from property tax rolls from full acquisition of parcels for Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, is shown in Table 4-5. In addition to the removal of land from tax rolls for transportation improvements, implementation of the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in the removal of approximately 2 to 3 acres of land in California from property tax rolls. The assessed value (AV) of property removed from tax rolls by Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would range between approximately $3.1 million and $3.7 million in California. Depending on the alternative, this would result in an estimated loss of between approximately $30,600 and $74,600 in property tax revenues to local public agencies in California. Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, could result in additional taxable value created from the commercial development opportunities facilitated by the project. Upon development, the new AV of the buildings and land comprising the potential development sites would be levied property taxes. The estimate of additional (new) AV from the mixed-use development is approximately $40 million for these alternatives (see Table 4-6). The net increase in AV with implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would range between $22 million and $26 million in California. This analysis demonstrates that any potential declines in assessed value from displaced properties would be offset by potential gains from the new development. In total, the potential effects would be relatively modest when placed in the context of total citywide property tax collections. In Fiscal-Year 2014-15, the City received approximately $6.2 million in property taxes, based on a total assessed value of $4.1 billion (Walker, pers. comm., 2016:3). The estimated net new AV from the project represents an increase of approximately 0.5 percent over the assessed value of property in the city.  Table 4-5 Estimated Assessed Value of Property Removed from Tax Rolls for Mixed-Use Development  Land Use  Full Acquisition (acres)  Assessed Value (dollars)  Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action)   Commercial   0.99  1,881,000  Lodging  0.55  1,100,000  Residential  0.34  731,000  Vacant  0  0  Total Acres  1.88  3,712,000  Alternative C: Triangle One-Way  Commercial   1.00  1,900,000  Lodging  0.55  1,100,000  Residential  0.34  731,000  Vacant  0  0  Total Acres  1.89  3,731,000  Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2  Commercial   0.38  722,000  Lodging  0  0  Residential  1.03  2,214,500  Vacant  1.21  121,000  Total Acres  2.62  3,057,500  Source: Adapted from Walker, pers. comm., 2016    Table 4-6 Assessed Value of Potential Mixed-Use Development  Development Type  Value  Alternatives B and C1  Alternative D2  Commercial  $300/square foot  $13,875,000  $14,400,000  Residential3 (Affordable)  $115,000/unit  $26,335,000  $25,760,000  Total  NA  $40,210,000  $40,160,000  NA = not applicable  1 Mixed-use development for Alternatives B and C would include up to 46,250 square feet of commercial building space and 229 housing units. 2 Mixed-use development for Alternative D would include up to 48,000 square feet of commercial building space and 224 housing units. 3 Assuming all of the housing units would be affordable is a conservative, low estimate of the potential AV for the new residential development because the residential development could be a mix of affordable and market-rate housing. Source: Adapted from Walker, pers. comm., 2016  Sales Tax Revenues Implementation of Alternatives B and C mixed-use development would result in a loss of 11,700 square feet of commercial building space (see Table 4-4). However, the mixed-use development would construct 46,250 square feet of new commercial building space and result in a net increase in commercial building space of 34,550 square feet. Alternative D mixed-use development and the transportation improvements would result in the loss of 11,700 square feet of commercial building space. With Alternative D, the mixed-use development would construct 48,000 square feet of new commercial building space and result in a net increase in commercial building space of 36,300 square feet. The net increase in commercial building space created by these alternatives would reasonably be expected to increase sales tax revenues for the City of South Lake Tahoe over existing conditions. Transient Occupancy Tax Revenues The effect of implementing Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development would result in similar losses of TOT revenues as described above for Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements. Conclusion Alternative B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would result in the loss of sales tax revenue from eight commercial businesses and TOT revenues from TAUs not operating as SRO units. Because there is a large number of hotel/motels and commercial businesses throughout the city, the loss of sales tax and TOT revenues from the mixed-use development would not be considered substantial. Additionally, the loss of sales tax revenue from existing businesses would be offset by the increase in commercial area proposed by these alternatives. Furthermore, as described herein, the mixed-use development would result in a net increase in assessed value of properties in the city’s tax roll. For these reasons, Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not result in an adverse impact on property tax, sales tax, and transient occupancy tax revenues. CHANGE IN LEVEL OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY Because Alternative A would maintain the existing US 50 alignment and would not make any other improvements that would result in effects on businesses within the study area, this alternative would not result in changes in the level of business activity. Alternatives B, C, and D Transportation Improvements As described above, the South Shore’s tourism-based economy has suffered substantial declines in many key categories, including visitation levels, retail sales, hotel occupancy and room rates, gaming revenues, and others. These indicators reflect a structural weakness in the South Shore tourism economy, which is not likely to be corrected unless substantial steps are undertaken to improve the tourism product (i.e., visitor amenities and environment in the South Shore). As stated in Chapter 1, “Introduction,” one purpose of the project is to create opportunities for redevelopment and revitalization in the study area. Improvements to existing US 50 through the tourist core to create a safer environment for pedestrian and bicycle travel would make the study area more inviting for local residents and visitors to patronize existing businesses. Additionally, as identified in Chapter 1, one of the project objectives is to facilitate the creation of a safe and walkable district that enhances pedestrian activities and safety and improves the City of South Lake Tahoe’s and Douglas County’s competitiveness with other regional and national tourist destinations. Visibility of Businesses in the Tourist Core Transportation improvements included in Alternatives B, C, and D would realign US 50 around the tourist core and existing US 50 would become a local street. Although a large proportion of the vehicle traffic would be routed around the tourist core, access to and visibility of businesses in the tourist core would not be eliminated. Within the tourist core, the existing US 50 would be reduced to one lane in each direction with left-turn pockets. Although there would be a reduction in vehicle numbers that pass by the businesses along existing US 50 through the tourist core, the roadway changes in this area would result in slower travel speeds improving visibility of businesses for vehicles. The traffic numbers through the tourist core would decrease; however, the capture rate of the occupants of the vehicles would likely increase because the vehicle speeds are reduced and occupants are drawn toward the compelling environment and appeal that would result from the streetscape changes (e.g., sidewalk improvements and landscaping) the project would implement (TTD 2013:53). As described in the economic study, high traffic volumes and lack of adequate pedestrian facilities can be a strong deterrent to an enjoyable experience at outdoor shopping destinations and “al fresco” dining. Tourist-oriented retail is among the least vulnerable categories of retail to a reduction in visibility and, often, these types of retailers often become more successful when traffic is slowed and pedestrian activity is increased (TTD 2013:3, 39).  The types of businesses that cater most to pass-by traffic and could be most affected by the reduction in vehicle traffic include gas stations and quick service or fast food restaurants (TTD 2013:38). Within the study area, this type of business would include 7 Eleven, Subway, the Tahoe Bottle Shop, and Tahoe Tom’s Gas Station and Convenience Store.  While the project would reroute US 50 around the tourist core, changing visibility to businesses along existing US 50, a more dramatic change to how vehicles pass by businesses within the commercial triangle west of the existing US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection would occur with removal of the portion of existing US 50 adjacent to these parcels. Access to these businesses would remain; however, visibility of these businesses would, in general, be reduced with the majority of traffic traveling through the new US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection located south of the 7 Eleven building. Visibility from vehicle traffic on the new US 50 would be most reduced for the Tahoe Bottle Shop and Alpaca store due to their distance from the new intersection. Although the Powder House building and the building containing the Naked Fish restaurant and Vinny’s Pizza would lose visibility from traffic to the west, these businesses would not entirely lose visibility to traffic on the realigned US 50 due to their proximity to the realignment and new intersection. Because the realigned US 50 would be located behind the 7 Eleven, Subway, and Taco Taqueria building and the new intersection would be located directly adjacent, the amount of visibility of these businesses to traffic would not change.  The economic study also states that implementation of a marketing program that could be supported by transient-occupancy taxes (TOTs), increment tax, or a business improvement district would contribute to the success of the project in creating a compelling main street and drawing visitors to the study area (TTD 2013:58). Furthermore, to address local business concerns at the Heavenly Village Center about their visibility to vehicles using the realigned US 50, the economic study suggests that property owners in the project site may wish to make adaptations to the shopping center, such as new signage facilities and a more attractive entrance from the back of the center (TTD 2013:52). As described above, while traffic would be re-routed around the tourist core resulting in changes in visibility of businesses, vehicles traveling on the realigned US 50 would continue to be able to use existing driveways and other access points that would be signalized under the project to access Heavenly Village Way, and thus Heavenly Village Center and parking garage for Heavenly Village, and the Harrah’s entrance driveway. Additionally, the project would also develop and implement a signage plan for parking, visitor information centers, and recreation opportunities at appropriate locations throughout the project site (see Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Alternatives”). Other informational and interpretive/educational/way finding signs may also be installed along the tourist core area and near the pedestrian overcrossing into Van Sickle Bi-State Park. With Alternative C, a portion of the existing traffic would be rerouted around the tourist core. It is reasonable to assume that travel speeds through the tourist core would be higher under Alternative C than Alternatives B and D because Alternative C would include two-lane, one-way traffic with one bicycle lane and would not add medians. For these reasons, the capture rate of vehicle occupants for businesses in the tourist core would be estimated to be lower than that which could occur under Alternatives B and D. Therefore, the beneficial effects on business visibility that are described for Alternatives B and D would be less likely or would be reduced under Alternative C. Proposed Complete Street Improvements The realignment of US 50 would serve to reduce conflicts between pedestrians or non-motorized transportation and fast-moving, high volumes of traffic and would not increase the capacity of the roadway. As demonstrated in Impacts 3.6-1 through 3.6-3 and 3.6-11 through 3.6-13 in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation,” the study area would experience an increase in vehicle traffic similar to that which would occur under the no project scenario (Alternative A). Additionally, the number of lanes in the existing US 50 through the tourist core would be reduced, bicycle lanes (or an optional cycle track) would be created, enhanced and new sidewalks, and center median would be constructed. These changes would help facilitate creation of a safer environment for pedestrians (including those with disabilities) and cyclists within the tourist core and help establish the tourist core as a complete street or main street, a vibrant, walkable, and attractive business district. (Complete streets are defined as streets designed and operated to enable safe access for all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and transit riders of all ages and abilities.) The types of transportation improvements proposed under Alternatives B, C, and D would help enhance the tourism product through the establishment of a complete street, which would complement other recent and planned redevelopment efforts (e.g., Chateau at the Village and Zalanta) as well as existing amenities for visitors and residents, including Heavenly Mountain Resort, Van Sickle Bi-State Park, and the lake (TTD 2013:47, 49, 55-56).  Physical Changes in the Tourist Core The physical effects on the environment from implementation of the project are assessed in Sections 3.2 through 3.19 in this EIR/EIS/EIS and are briefly summarized here:   Visual effects from the project are assessed in Section 3.7, “Visual Resources/Aesthetics.” As described in Impact 3.7-1, Alternatives B, C, and D would result in less-than-significant impacts on the scenic quality and visual character of the portion of the project site through the tourist core either because no changes in visual conditions would occur, changes that would occur would be visually beneficial, or changes would be compatible with existing conditions.  As assessed in Impacts 3.6-1 through 3.6-4 and 3.6-12 through 3.6-14 in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation,” Alternatives B and D would not result in significant impacts on vehicle miles of travel (VMT) or result in significant impacts on intersection and road segment level of service (LOS) in the study area. Impacts from Alternative C would be similar, except this alternative would result in significant impacts on intersection and road segment LOS in the study area.  As described in Impact 3.6-7 in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation,” the construction phase of the project would implement a Transportation Management Plan (TMP). Implementation of the TMP would minimize traffic flow disruption to the extent possible through the construction work zones and enhance the safety of the work zones for the traveling public and workers. Alternatives B, C, and D would not result in significant impacts on transportation disruptions associated with construction activity.  Potentially significant impacts from construction emissions associated with Alternatives B, C, and D would be reduced to less than significant with implementation of Mitigation Measures 3.13-1a and 3.13-1b (see Impact 3.13-1 in Section 3.13, “Air Quality”). Alternative B would not have any other significant impacts on air quality within the study area. Implementation of these alternatives would not result in a substantial adverse change to the physical environment such that businesses in the study area would be adversely affected.  As described in Impacts 3.6-5, 3.6-6, 3.6-15, 3.6-16, and 3.6-18 in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation,” Alternatives B, C, and D would result in beneficial impacts on bicycle and pedestrian facilities, bicycle and pedestrian safety, and transit.   As assessed in Impacts 3.15-3, the impact of Alternatives B, C, and D on future traffic noise levels through the tourist core would be less than significant. For these reasons, implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D would not result in a substantial adverse change to the environment near businesses in the tourist core. Implementation of these alternatives would not be anticipated to cause a long-term adverse change in activity at the businesses in the study area from changes in the environment. However, relative to Alternatives B and D, Alternative C would result in one-way travel within the tourist core and on the realigned highway around the tourist core, which would result in adverse effects on intersection and road segment LOS greater in magnitude. Parking Within the study area, large parking areas are provided at Montbleu, Harrah’s, Harvey’s, Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, Heavenly Village parking garage, and the Heavenly Village Center. Effects of Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements on parking are assessed in Impacts 3.6-9 and 3.6-10 in Section 3.6, “Transportation and Traffic.” As part of the project, Alternatives B, C, and D would construct replacement parking for businesses that would be affected by partial acquisitions near the existing US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection. As described above, the project would enhance signage in the project site, which would include signage for existing parking areas. This would attempt to enhance visitors’ and residents’ perceptions of parking opportunities in the project site. Changes in parking resulting from these alternatives would not affect parking in the project site that could cause an adverse change in business activity in the project site associated with parking.  Other Opportunities for Enhancement of the Tourist Core The Economic Analysis identified a number of factors that would contribute to the success of the project in increasing the number of visitors and residents that are attracted to the study area (TTD 2016:58 – 60). Many of these factors are not proposed as part of the project, such as creation of a business district and reorientation of retail, are the types of activities that businesses within the study area would implement themselves. However, the project would help facilitate future implementation of other recommendations in the Economic Analysis, including completion of streetscape improvements, providing expanded opportunities for events, and enhancing public transit. As described in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives,” existing US 50 is well served by BlueGo, the South Shore area’s fixed-route bus service and commuter bus service connecting the area with Carson City and the Carson Valley. BlueGo’s Stateline Transit Center is located in the center of the tourist core on Transit Way. With Alternatives B, C, and D, the transportation improvements would reduce the number of travel lanes through the tourist core, making transit access more user-friendly with widened shoulders. These build alternatives would also include the construction of new bus shelters at existing bus stop locations where features are limited to signs and in some cases benches. These changes that would occur as part of the project help enhance transit opportunities in the tourist core that would contribute to encouraging visitors and residents to increase non-automobile use.  One way in which the study area could bolster visitation and more effectively compete with other tourist areas would be to provide a gathering place for special events and for locals and visitors to interact. Feedback from local businesses demonstrated interest in the possibility of additional events, concerts, festivals, and similar programs to draw visitors and give residents a reason to come to the tourist core (TTD 2013:26, 46). In the past, the resort-casino portion of the tourist core has closed down for special events; however, this led to traffic circulation problems. Compared to existing conditions, the realignment of US 50 and narrowing of the existing US 50 proposed by Alternatives B and D would be better suited to closing a portion of the tourist core for special events while continuing to meet the needs of vehicle traffic in the study area. Effects on Retail Sales The Economic Analysis identifies research that shows that while realignments can often have short-term, adverse impacts on the local economy, sales often improve in the longer term (TTD 2013:39, 51). During the short-term, construction and transitional period, potential retail sales losses are estimated to range between $900,000 to $5.5 million per year, accounting for just 1.6 percent of total citywide retail sales (TTD 2013:53). Outreach with businesses in the study area conducted for the Economic Analysis shows that many of these businesses (73 percent of survey respondents) have been operating for more than a decade, 20 percent have been operating between 6 and 10 years, and a small proportion (7 percent) have been operating for less than 2 years (TTD 2013:40). The longevity of businesses in the study area demonstrates they have endured challenging economic times.  The Economic Analysis estimated existing annual retail sales, short-term changes in retail sales, and long-term changes in retail sales for Heavenly Village and the Heavenly Village Center (see Table 4-7). As described above, Alternatives B, C, and D would develop and implement a TMP during construction that would include all reasonable and feasible measures to minimize traffic disruption and maintain access to businesses during construction. However, the construction activities could still be perceived as a deterrent to business activity in the study area and would be estimated to result in a loss of between 1 and 6 percent of existing retail sales in the short-term. While there would be short-term losses of existing retail sales, businesses in the study area would benefit in the long-term, by approximately 16 to 25 percent, from the improvements within the tourist core.  Table 4-7 Short-Term and Long-Term Effects of the Project on Retail Sales in Heavenly Village and the Heavenly Village Center    Estimated Existing Annual Retail Sales (dollars)  Change in Retail Sales1  Low End of Range  (dollars) (percent change)  High End of Range  (dollars) (percent change)  Potential Short-Term Transitional Impacts  100,040,000  -920,000 (-1%)  -5,510,000 (-6%)  Potential Long-Term Retail Impacts  +16,390,000 (+16%)  +25,220,000 (+25%)  1 “+” = increase and “-” = decrease  Source: TTD 2013:54  The Economic Analysis did not estimate existing annual retail sales or short-term and long-term changes in retail sales for other retail located along existing US 50 through the tourist core outside of the Heavenly Village Center and Heavenly Village. However, the short-term and long-term effects on retail sales shown in Table 4-7 demonstrate the scale of the effect the project could have on these other retailers. For these reasons, it can be reasonably assumed that long-term economic effects on these retail businesses would be anticipated to exceed the short-term losses that could occur during construction of the project. Because the resort-casinos are highly visible from various portions of the South Shore, they are not dependent on visibility from existing US 50 specifically (TTD 2013:56). For these reasons, the resort-casinos would not be anticipated to be adversely affected by the project. Conclusion As described above, the project would implement a Transportation Management Plan (TMP) that would use all reasonable and feasible measures to minimize traffic disruption and maintain access to businesses during construction; however, reduced business activity from temporary discouragement of access to businesses within the tourist core could not be eliminated.  The project would result in a permanent change in visibility of businesses within the project site. However, the types of transportation improvements proposed as part of the project, including complete streets improvements through the tourist core, streetscape improvements, providing expanded opportunities for events, and enhancing public transit could make the project site more attractive to visitors and local residents. These types of changes are estimated to result in a long-term increase in business activity that would exceed the short-term losses in retail sales associated with construction activities. Therefore, Alternatives B, C, and D transportation improvements would not have an adverse impact on long-term business activity within the study area. Alternatives B, C, and D Mixed-Use Development, Including Replacement Housing Because construction of the potential mixed-use development would be limited to within their respective sites, Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not interfere with short-term business activity in the study area. The direct effects of these alternatives are discussed in Impact 3.4-8 in Section 3.4, “Community Impacts,” which indicates an increase in the level of business activity in the study area. Additionally, the mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would likely enhance the walkability and tourism product in the tourist core by providing residences close to shopping and jobs and by providing additional commercial businesses. For these reasons, Alternatives B, C, and D mixed-use development, including replacement housing, would not have an adverse effect on long-term business activity within the study area. Alternative E: Skywalk Construction of Alternative E would require lane closures and temporary full closure of US 50, which would be a significant and unavoidable traffic-related impact (see Impact 3.6-6 in Section 3.6, “Traffic and Transportation”). Alternative E would develop and implement a TMP to minimize construction effects on access to businesses, the closure of US 50 and continued construction in the tourist core would likely contribute to a loss in short-term retail sales in the tourist core.  Implementation of Alternative E would result in development of a raised concrete deck over the entire width and length of existing US 50 between Stateline Avenue and the northern end of the Montbleu Resort and Casino that would be used by pedestrians along the tourist core near the resort-casinos. Alternative E does not involve realignment of US 50 that could change long-term visibility of businesses in the tourist core; however, unlike Alternatives B, C, and D, Alternative E does not develop any complete street improvements or provide new opportunities for enhancing the tourism product. For these reasons and because Alternative E would not result in many changes in the tourist core beyond the raised pedestrian walkway, this alternative would not have an adverse effect on long-term business activity within the study area.    This page intentionally left blank.  5 COMMENTS AND COORDINATION 5.1 INTRODUCTION Early and ongoing coordination with the public and agencies is an essential part of the environmental process. It helps the lead agencies determine the necessary scope of environmental documentation, and identify potential impacts and avoidance, minimization, and/or mitigation measures, if needed. Agency consultation and public participation for this project have been accomplished through a variety of formal and informal methods, including: meetings for the Project Development Team (PDT), interagency coordination, Community Review Committee, Business Review Committee, and the public. This chapter summarizes the results of the Tahoe Transportation District’s (TTD) public and agency coordination efforts. 5.2 PUBLIC SCOPING 5.2.1 Notice of Preparation/Notice of Intent The scoping process for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project was initiated with the preparation and distribution of a Notice of Preparation (NOP) of the environmental impact report (EIR) and Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) environmental impact statement (EIS) and the publication of a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) EIS in the Federal Register. The formal scoping process period was initiated on November 2, 2011, and ended on December 16, 2011. The NOP was posted at the State Clearinghouse (No. 2011112009) and was circulated to public agencies and other interested parties in compliance with Section 15082 of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines and TRPA Rules of Procedure on November 2, 2011. The NOP notified the public of the preparation of the joint EIR/EIS/EIS; the scoping meeting dates, times, and locations; and how to provide comments on the project. The NOI was published on November 1, 2011, in the Federal Register in compliance with 40 Code of Federal Regulations 1508.28. The NOI included the background of the project, the project purpose and need, a brief description of the proposed alternatives, information regarding the scoping meeting locations, and how to provide comments on the project. Copies of the NOP and NOI are provided in Appendix A, “NOP/NOI and Scoping Report.” 5.2.2 Scoping Meetings In addition to the NOP/NOI, two public scoping meetings were held as part of the scoping process. The meetings were held as follows:  November 10, 2011. TTD Board, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 128 Market Street, Stateline, Nevada (Beginning at 1:00 p.m.).  December 7, 2011. TRPA Advisory Planning Commission (APC), Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 128 Market Street, Stateline, Nevada (Beginning at 9:30 a.m.). 5.2.3 Comments Received During Scoping A total of 28 written comment letters and nine oral comments were received from state, regional/local agencies, community groups, members of the general public, and other interested parties via letters, emails, and recorded scoping meeting comments. Comments received pertain to the following resources. Appendix A includes a more detailed summary of comments received:  public services and utilities;  alternatives;  floodplains;   land use;  community impacts;  environmental justice;  parks and recreational facilities;  visual resources/aesthetics;   water quality and stormwater runoff;  geology, soils, land capability and coverage;  hazards, hazardous materials, and risk of upset;  greenhouse gas emissions and climate change;  noise and vibration;  traffic and transportation/ pedestrian and bicycle facilities;  biological resources; and  cumulative impacts.  The Scoping Summary Report (2012), attached in Appendix A, documented the scoping process and contains the following documents and more detailed information regarding the scoping process and comments submitted on the project:  summary of the written and oral comments received in response to the NOP and NOI,  copies of the NOP and NOI,   scoping meeting materials,  formal scoping letters, and  public hearing comment summary.  5.3 CONSULTATION AND COORDINATION WITH AGENCIES 5.3.1 Section 4(f) Consultation Impacts on publicly owned parks are discussed in detail in Section 3.3, “Parks and Recreational Facilities.” TTD has consulted with the Nevada Division of State Parks (NDSP) and the California Tahoe Conservancy (Conservancy), who jointly managed Van Sickle Bi-State Park, as it relates to the project’s effect on the land, activities, features, or attributes of the park, a resource that qualifies for protection under Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966. Coordination with the public agencies that own and manage a public park resource is a Section 4(f) requirement. Meetings with NDSP and the Conservancy were held on:  January 10, 2014;  October 20, 2014;   August 11, 2015; and  January 21, 2016.  Meeting attendees that participated in at least one of the Section 4(f) meetings include:  Carl Hasty, District Manager, TTD;  Adam Spear, General Counsel, TTD;  Russ Nygaard, Transportation Capital Program Manager, TTD;  Larry Vinzant, Senior Environmental Protection Specialist, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), California Division;  Cesar Perez, Senior Transportation Engineer, FHWA-California Division;  Abdelmoez (Del) Abdalla, Environmental Program Manager, FHWA-Nevada Division;  Brett Gainer, Office of the Chief Counsel, FHWA;  Will McClure, Civil Rights Program Manager, FHWA-California Division;  Dave Tedrick, Senior Environmental Protection Specialist, FHWA-California Division;  Jake Nelson, Environmental Planner, California Department of Transportation (Caltrans);  Pedro Rodriguez, Project Manager, Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT);  Mark Davis, Chief of Planning and Development, NDSP;  Dana Dapolito, Conservation Staff Specialist, NDSP;  Tim Hunt, Chief of Planning and Development, NDSP;  Bob Mergell, Deputy Administrator, NDSP;  Eric Johnson, Division Administrator, NDSP;  Penny Stewart, Supervising Environmental Planner, Conservancy; and  Sue Rae Irelan, Associate Environmental Planner, Conservancy. The purpose of these meetings was to discuss: the necessity of using a narrow strip of park property in the relocated highway right-of-way, potential Section 4(f) issues related to Van Sickle Bi-State Park, project design features to address concerns raised by NDSP and the Conservancy, illustrations of project elements in the context of Van Sickle Bi-State Park, and TTD’s Joint Planning Exception request under Section 4(f) Guidelines. Through the coordination process, design features have been included in the project alternatives so that the project would not adversely affect the activities, features, and attributes that qualify the park for protection under Section 4(f). The outcome of the Section 4(f) process is a proposed de minimis finding, in accordance with FHWA procedures. A summary of the FHWA proposed de minimis finding is provided in Chapter 4, “Other NEPA-, CEQA-, and TRPA-Mandated Sections.” Appendix D includes documentation of the Section 4(f) preliminary determination. 5.3.2 SHPO Consultation Consultation with the California State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and Nevada SHPO has been initiated for cultural resources in the Area of Potential Effect (APE), as documented in the California Archaeological Survey Report (ASR), Nevada ASR, California Historical Resources Evaluation Report (HRER), and the Nevada HRER. 5.3.3 Native American Consultation and Coordination The Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC) was contacted to request a search of its sacred lands file, along with contact information for Native American representatives who might have details about cultural resources in the study area. In its response, dated March 12, 2012, the NAHC stated that its search of the sacred lands file had failed to identify any Native American cultural resources within the project site limits or immediate project vicinity. The NAHC also provided a list of Native American representatives, recommending that these individuals be contacted for information regarding cultural resources.  On March 29, 2012, letters describing the project with a map depicting the APE were sent to each of the Native American individuals and organizations on the contacts list provided by the NAHC, requesting any information or concerns they might have regarding cultural resources in the APE. Follow-up telephone calls were placed on April 13, 2012, after no response to the letters had been received. One individual, Mr. Darrel Cruz, Tribal Historic Preservation Officer of the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California, was contacted. During an April 16, 2012, telephone conversation, Mr. Cruz stated that the study area has been disturbed by urban improvements, that he does not know of any cultural resources within the project site, and that the areas along creeks near the project site are archaeologically sensitive. Mr. Cruz requested that the tribe be “kept involved” as the project progresses and stated that the tribe is available to monitor if archaeological testing or construction excavation takes place. In accordance with California Assembly Bill (AB) 52 (Statutes of 2014), tribal cultural resources were added as a resource subject to review under CEQA, effective January 1, 2015, so they are considered in this EIR/EIS/EIS. Because the NOP for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project was issued in 2011, before the effective date of the consultation provisions of AB 52, the procedural prescriptions of the statute regarding consultation do not apply to this project. Nonetheless, communication with the Washoe Tribe of California and Nevada, as noted above, has been undertaken as part of the environmental analysis (see above and Section 3.8, “Cultural Resources”). 5.4 COMMUNITY OUTREACH MEETINGS A summary of the types of community outreach meetings and other public outreach efforts, beyond those meetings conducted as part of the scoping process, is provided in Table 1-2 of Section 1.5, “Summary of Public Involvement,” of this document. Beginning in 2011, outreach efforts consisted of the following:   PDT meetings;   public workshops to gain public input on the project design;   meetings with community members and business community members;   presentations to the South Lake Tahoe City Council and Douglas County Board of County Commissioners;   service club presentations;   one-on-one meetings with stakeholders, business owners, and community groups;   flyer distribution; and   media alerts. Prior to these efforts, when preparing the US Highway 50/Stateline Area Transportation Study, TRPA and other members of the PDT recognized that community involvement in the planning of the project was a key component. Property and business owners, local organizations, and the general public were provided an opportunity to respond to questionnaires and attend stakeholder meetings on the project, along with two rounds of community workshops held on October 15, 2003 and on March 4, 2004.  5.5 PROJECT DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT The public outreach efforts and coordination with agency stakeholders, community groups, and business owners that has occurred as part of the environmental review process has influenced the development of alternatives assessed in this EIR/EIS/EIS. The following alternatives and design features arose from this process:  The development of Alternative B and Alternative C arose during PDT meetings. These alternatives were developed to avoid displacement of businesses that would occur as part of Alternative D.  Alternative E was developed in response to elected officials’ and public concerns related to displacement of residents of the Rocky Point neighborhood southwest of the Heavenly Village Center. An objective of the alternative was to determine if an alternative could feasibly avoid all displacement. Additionally, Alternative E was also designed to address conflicts between pedestrians and vehicle traffic on US 50 through the resort-casino portion of the tourist core.  In response to public comments received during scoping and concerns expressed by the Conservancy and NDSP regarding access to Van Sickle Bi-State Park after the highway realignment, Alternatives B through D propose a new pedestrian bridge extending over the relocated US 50 alignment between the tourist core and the park at a point just west of the Harrah’s entrance driveway.  REFERENCES CITED CHAPTER 1, INTRODUCTION California Department of Transportation. 2016a (May).

Likewise, the portion located in Nevada is subject to review and approval by the Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) and Douglas County. Since the project is part of the federal highway system, it is also subject to review and approval by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). This document is intended to provide historical and current information to all interested parties, including the public, regarding the following items: • Project Description -briefly what and why page 3 • Project Development Team (PDT) -who’s guiding the process? page 4 • Timeline -a little history page 5 • Purpose and Need -the project’s foundation page 9 • Project Development Process Overview -four comprehensive phases page 11 • Project Development Process Chart -the full circle page 12 • Right of Way Process Overview -compensation, acquisition and relocation page 13 • Project Alternatives -exploring the possibilities page 15 • Alternative Evaluation Matrix page 16 • Alternative Maps Briefly what and why The US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project is intended to complete the Loop Road and address existing transportation deficiencies and future transportation needs along the US 50 corridor between Pioneer Trail in South Lake Tahoe, California and Nevada State Route 207 (Kingsbury Grade) in Douglas County, Nevada. There is a community demand for transportation improvements within the entire US 50 corridor to create a better, safer balance between pedestrian, bicyclist, transit, and private vehicle access while giving consideration to the unique environmental setting of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Facilitating revitalization of the area through public and private investment, as well as promoting economic vitality, are additional project goals. The transportation system components to be addressed include: roadways, transit and business access, along with bicycle and pedestrian facilities and amenities. Plans will seek opportunities to: • enhance pedestrian activities and safety • decrease dependence on the use of private automobiles • calm traffic in the corridor and develop a “complete street” for all users • improve visual and environmental conditions within the corridor The project must be consistent with Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) thresholds regarding land use, air and water quality, noise, and scenic resources. It is important that the project also satisfy federal, state, and local transportation standards for design and operations. As part of a plan for the development of an integrated system of transportation within the Tahoe Region, the project also complies with Article V(2) of the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact (Public Law 96-551, 1980). This law specifically calls for consideration of the completion of the Loop Road in the states of California and Nevada. The objective is to reduce dependency on automobiles and, to the extent feasible, air pollution from them around Lake Tahoe. Who’s guiding the process? From feasibility studies to construction implementation, a Project Development Team (PDT) guides the process, following established regional, state and federal project management parameters. In essence, the PDT is technical steering committee, with a larger project team performing routine development activities. The PDT conceptualizes and refines (as needed) the project, based on the adopted “Purpose and Need Statement,” as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The team employs multiple disciplines (such as engineering, environmental protection, aesthetics, operations and maintenance, and overall value analysis) to conduct studies and accumulate data for developing and evaluating alternatives. They make recommendations and detail the project work plan, schedule and budget for consideration by responsible parties such as local agencies and the public. Members of the PDT participate in key presentations such as technical advisory meetings, public hearings and community workshops. For larger, more complex projects, PDTs are extended and formalized (as required by law) to include a wide range of disciplines and individuals from outside agencies. Representatives from established community groups may also be included as needed. The PDT for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project represents a variety of federal, state and local agencies, as well as other stakeholders and interested parties. Below is a list of those currently represented: • Tahoe Transportation District (TTD) • FHWA • TRPA • Caltrans • NDOT • City of South Lake Tahoe • Douglas County • El Dorado County • Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board • Nevada Division of Environmental Protection • Army Corp of Engineers • California State Parks • Nevada State Parks • California Tahoe Conservancy • South Tahoe PUD • Business Owners • Property Owners Meeting throughout the development of this project, the PDT has been integral in providing direction, developing goals and objectives and creating the project's “Purpose and Need Statement.” They have devised, reviewed and refined alternative solutions, based on technical and environmental data. New members may be added to the PDT as needed. Other sources of input, such as community advisory committees, can also be organized. A little history Precursors to the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project, to address existing and planned development as well as the area’s designation as an air quality non-attainment area, were considered as early as the late 1970s. Following is an overview of the project’s history. Late 1970s Casino Expansion Approved As part of the approval of the expansion of three major casinos, mitigation required the construction of a Loop Road to address traffic congestion in the US 50 corridor. Nevada’s portion was built but California’s was never completed. 1980 Revised Tahoe Regional Planning Compact (the Compact) Signed When the Compact was revised in 1980, Article V(2) (Public Law 96-551) required “consideration of the completion of the Loop Road in the States of California and Nevada.” 1985 Community Development Study Group Established Created by the South Tahoe Redevelopment Agency, the study group included members of City government, TRPA, local businesses, the California Office of the Attorney General, the League to Save Lake Tahoe and neighborhood groups. Its findings were presented in a conceptual plan, adopted by the Redevelopment Agency in April 1986. This conceptual plan established general parameters for the Loop Road system, including: • closure of Pioneer Trail at US 50 • construction of two four-lane connectors between US 50 and the north and south Loop Roads (Pine Boulevard and Montreal Road in California and Lake Parkway in Nevada) • upgrading Pine Boulevard to five lanes • extending Montreal Road • re-designating the bypassed portion of US 50 as one-way eastbound • minor modifications to other streets, such as cul-de-sacs, within the immediate vicinity To expand upon and implement the conceptual plan, the Redevelopment Agency contracted with ROMA Design Group of San Francisco. 1986-1987 ROMA Redevelopment Plan and Draft Environmental Impact Documents Written The ROMA version included a circulation element, proposing expanded use of the Loop Road system on both sides of US 50, in the Stateline area, to reduce traffic along Lake Tahoe Boulevard. Refinements, through public input, were also made to the original conceptual plan, with alternatives developed that differed in numbers of lanes on the north and south Loop Roads and existing US 50. In 1987 the Redevelopment Agency authorized preparation of an Environmental Impact Report/Statement (EIR/EIS) for the ROMA Redevelopment Plan alternatives. They were further vetted during the associated public outreach process and revised accordingly. However, the project was never constructed. 1990 Loop Road Project Preliminary Roadway Design Report Prepared Based on the alternatives developed in the 1987 ROMA plan, South Lake Tahoe and Douglas County prepared a report including, for each alternative, preliminary roadway design, geometric analysis, preliminary cost estimate, traffic analysis, drainage improvements, landscape improvements and other engineering-related information. 1991 Loop Road Project Environmental Impact Documents Completed To further analyze and document the impacts of the Preliminary Roadway Design Report alternatives, South Lake Tahoe sponsored and completed an EIR/EIS, covering: the One-Way, Five-Lane, Three-Lane and North Park Alternatives. All four included both north and south Loop Roads. A Technical Advisory Committee {TAC), several public outreach meetings and formal public hearings contributed to this effort. However, the final EIR/EIS was never certified. 1993 Stateline Community Plan (Nevada) Adopted The Nevada side of the project area adopted a plan that anticipated completing the Loop Road and reducing the number of travel lanes on existing Highway 50. The following pertained to both: • Loop Road: In conjunction with South Lake Tahoe, the mountainside Loop Road will be increased from two travel lanes to four and linked more directly to Highway 50. • Highway 50: lf a trial period proves successful; Highway 50 will be reduced from four travel lanes to two, with the resulting space used for pedestrian amenities and transit facilities. • Traffic Flow: The plan for the Loop Road and Highway 50 will include improvements for access drives and internal circulation within the casino core. • Pedestrian Facilities: A system of new paths, sidewalks and lighting for bikes and pedestrians will encourage walking, making decreased reliance on the automobile and associated environmental benefits possible. 1994 Stateline/Ski Run Community Plan (California) Adopted in May On the California side of the project area, the City of South Lake Tahoe adopted a similar plan. Supporting the Loop Road system, this plan specifically stated, “Traffic congestion along the US 50 corridor in the Stateline area has not only created major circulation problems, but has resulted in a reduction in air quality. The Community Plan Team and the Redevelopment Agency propose to rectify these and related issues through the retirement and/or rehabilitation of existing tourist accommodations and retail commercial facilities, as well as the diversion of a significant share of vehicular traffic around the Stateline area by means of the proposed Loop Road system." Additionally, this Community Plan proposed reconfiguring and extending the existing north and south Loop Roads to create a route around the congested Stateline Area and designating the mountainside loop as US 50. The “Proposed Transportation Improvements” section specified: • The project will increase the mountainside loop to five vehicle lanes, create three lanes on the lakeside loop and reduce the existing US 50 (inside the Loop Roads) to three vehicle lanes. Incorporated into the improvements will be: bicycle facilities, pedestrian facilities, reductions in driveway accesses, landscaping and noise abatement devices. • The through-traffic lanes between the Loop Roads and Stateline will be reduced to three lanes in conjunction with the similar reduction on US 50 east of Stateline. Lanes for turn movements and bike travel shall be a part of the project. Unused areas of the right-of-way shall be converted for transit and pedestrian uses. • After completion of the Loop Roads and when traffic counts warrant, a new local road will be constructed to link Pioneer Trail at upper Ski Run to the Loop Road. This roadway shall have no access to any adjoining properties between the two intersections. Incorporated into the roadway design should be bicycle/pedestrian facilities. A Class I bike trail is the preferred alternative. • Ski Run Blvd. shall have three lanes (to eliminate passing and provide for safe left turns into the adjoining neighborhood) and on street parking. In addition to the curb and gutter, there will be facilities for bicyclists and pedestrians. • Intersection Improvements will include: -right and left turn lanes from US 50 to the Loop Road and the elimination of the Pioneer Trail connection to US 50. The intersection design shall assume that US 50 will be reduced to three lanes east of the intersection. This reduction shall not be permanent until after the Loop Road evaluation period. -improving right-and left-turn movements while maintaining four pedestrian crosswalks 2002-2004 US Highway 50/Stateline Area Transportation Study Conducted Initiated in October 2002, this transportation planning effort was completed in May 2004 in cooperation with a robust Steering Committee established by TRPA. The Steering Committee included representation from the FHWA, Caltrans and NDOT, as well as participation by local governments, representatives of landowners and businesses in the project area, environmental advocacy groups and other interested parties. This study served to meet the Caltrans requirements for a Project Initiation Document (PID). The study involved significant public outreach. Residents and business owners received surveys and postcards. Public notices were issued and a project website was developed. Two community open houses were also held, the first on October 15, 2003 and the second on March 4, 2004. TRPA coordinated with the Steering Committee to prepare a report on the study, summarizing the planning process; identifying project goals and developing a purpose and need. The report also evaluated alternatives and associated design, engineering, and environmental considerations. Of four alternatives, the Steering Committee designated Alternative D (similar to the current 2 and 3 Build Alternatives, except for an additional roundabout proposed for the US 50/Lake Tahoe Boulevard/Pioneer Trail intersection.) as the preferred alternative. They recommended progressing into project development and the next phase of preparing a Caltrans-required Project Study Report. 2005 Caltrans Project Study Report Funded TRPA received funding from the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act to develop the Caltrans-required Project Study Report, based on the alternatives developed as part of the 2004 transportation plan study. 2008 Project Re-initiated by TRPA, Coordinating with Caltrans, NDOT and FHWA TTD, FHWA, NDOT, and Caltrans determined that the Caltrans project development process would be followed, throughout the course of the project, to ensure the most stringent requirements and processes for evaluations and delivery. A Project Development Team (PDT) was formed and the alternatives initially considered were those included in the 2004 US Highway 50/Stateline Area Transportation Study. 2009 Project Transitioned to Tahoe Transportation District (TTD) The TTD assumed responsibility for the project because, per Article IX of the Compact, it is designated to implement transportation projects, while the TRPA is a regulatory and land use planning agency. 2010 Project Study Report (PSR) Approved in May This scoping document, sponsored by TTD, evaluated the need for the project and considered potential engineering and environmental issues, as well as design alternatives. Evolving from the May 2004 study, three build alternatives were included. (One was excluded by the PDT as it did not meet the “Purpose and Need.”) During development of the PSR, the project was presented at a community open house, along with other TTD projects, as well as to the South Lake Tahoe City Council on several occasions. 2010 Project Approval & Environmental Documentation (PA&ED) Initiated in June Upon Caltrans’ approval of the PSR, TTD sponsored the PA&ED phase of the project to begin developing detailed engineering and environmental studies. The PDT reconvened and refined the project's “Purpose and Need” for consistency with Caltrans’, FHWA’s and NDOT’s requirements and to include both community and environmental goals. During the PA & ED process, significant public outreach was conducted: focus group meetings, community open houses, outreach to business owners and potentially displaced residents, including minority populations, and project presentations at City Council and TTD Board Meetings. 2010 Value Analysis (VA) Study Completed in November Conducted from June 21-25 and published in November, this TTD-sponsored study: • reviewed the validity of the design alternatives, • evaluated additional potential design solutions to improve constructability and reduce cost, • identified opportunities to enhance environmental features, • evaluated right-of-way concerns and • addressed maintenance issues, including snow removal and storage. The VA Team included representatives from Caltrans, NDOT, TTD and Wood Rodgers (design consultant). Douglas County also participated. The City of South Lake Tahoe was asked to join the team, but wasn’t able to at the time. 2012 Current Activities Engineering and environmental technical studies are ongoing. Further analysis of alternatives is being completed as the result of public and stakeholder input. This could result in the need to supplement all studies. The project’s foundation What is the “Purpose and Need”? A project’s “Need” is an identified, existing and future transportation deficiency or problem. The objectives that will be met to address the transportation deficiency constitute its “Purpose” and are the basis for developing and evaluating a solution or range of solutions. A clear, concise, and well justified “Purpose and Need Statement” is the foundation of every transportation project. It is critical for identifying, developing and evaluating a reasonable range of project alternatives, resulting in the selection of a preferred alternative. It also leads to a more precisely defined project cost, scope and schedule, expediting project delivery. Just as importantly, a well-crafted “Purpose and Need” explains to the public, stakeholders, and decision-makers that the expenditure of funds is necessary and worthwhile, and that the project‘s priority, relative to other transportation projects, is warranted. It ensures that the right project is built, accomplishing its primary goals and objectives. An effective “Purpose and Need Statement” also satisfies federal and state regulations: an environmental impact statement (EIS) shall “briefly specify the underlying purpose and need to which the agency is responding in proposing the alternatives including the proposed action” (40 Code of Federal Regulations §1 502.1 3); an environmental impact report (EIR) shall “contain a statement of objectives sought by the proposed project” and it “should include the underlying purpose of the project” [I 4 California Code of Regulations §1 51 24(b)]. The “Purpose and Need” for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project, included in the Project Study Report, was refined to more closely align with Caltrans’, FHWA’s and NDOT’s requirements and to ensure the statement is responsive to environmental statutes (NEPA, CEQA) and TRPA thresholds. Establishing consistency with all planning documents for the project area is another important component of preparing a comprehensive “Purpose and Need.” For example, Caltrans’ Transportation Corridor Concept Report (TCCR) for US 50 serves as one of the planning documents for the California side of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project. The “Purpose and Need” must reference the project area as it is defined in the TCCR: as a “four-lane conventional urban arterial with a center turn lane” and as the “main street of South Lake Tahoe.” Additionally, the TCCR identifies the Loop Road Project on the list of planned projects. Following is the current “Purpose and Need Statement” for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project: Purpose: The purpose of this project is to make improvements to the corridor consistent with the Loop Road System concept, reduce congestion; improve vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle safety; advance multimodal transportation opportunities; improve the environmental quality of the area; enhance visitor and community experience; and promote the economic vitality of the area. Need: A. Article V(2) of the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact (Public Law 96‐551), 1980 (the Compact), requires a transportation plan for the integrated development of a regional system of transportation within the Tahoe Region. The Compact requires the transportation plan to include consideration of the completion of the Loop Road System in the States of California and Nevada. Improvements are required to the corridor to meet the intent of the Loop Road System concept. B. Ongoing and proposed resort redevelopment in the project area has increased pedestrian traffic, creating a need for improved pedestrian safety, mobility, multi-modal transportation options. Improvements to pedestrian facilities, bicycle lanes and mass transit are needed to connect the outlying residential and retail-commercial uses with employment and entertainment facilities, including hotels and gaming interests. Currently, there are no bike lanes on US 50 through the project area and sidewalks are either not large enough to meet the increased demand, or do not exist. These issues impact the visitor and community experience within the area. C. Environmental improvements are needed in the area to help achieve the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency’s (TRPA’s) environmental thresholds, including water quality and air quality. Improvements to storm water runoff collection and treatment facilities are needed to meet TRPA and Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board regulations and requirements. Reduction of vehicle congestion and reducing the number of vehicles on the roadway through enhanced pedestrian and multi‐modal opportunities is needed to provide for improved air quality. Landscape improvements are needed to enhance the scenic resource element of the project area to facilitate compliance with TRPA’s Scenic Threshold and to enhance the community and tourism experience. D. The project is needed to mitigate severe summer and winter peak period traffic congestion along US 50 in the project area. During peak hours, traffic often operates at Level of Service “F” (breakdown) when tourism is at its peak during the summer and winter months. Four comprehensive phases As previously mentioned, since the project is a bi-state cooperative effort, it is subject to review and approval by multiple entities (Caltrans, NDOT, FHWA, Douglas County, South Lake Tahoe and TRPA). However, when the project was re-initiated by TRPA in 2008, the agencies decided to follow, for the most part, one project development process, Caltrans’. This determination was made because it: • is considered the most thorough, ensuring comprehensive analyses during all project phases. • generally aligns with FHWA requirements, with which the project must comply in both California and Nevada. (FHWA staff, in both state offices, accepts the Caltrans process.) • is more comprehensive than NDOT’s project delivery process, which would not provide the in-depth analysis required for the California side. (NDOT staff concurred that the Caltrans project delivery process should be followed.) • meets the stipulations of multiple potential funding sources for eventual project construction. Although Caltrans’ project development process will be followed, the actual design and construction standards of the agency that has jurisdiction, and will ultimately own and operate a specific segment, will also be applied to that segment. In addition, any special requirements of a jurisdictional agency will be adhered to throughout project development. Caltrans’ project development process is divided into four main phases (page 12): Project Initiation Document (PID), Project Approval and Environmental Documentation (PA&ED), Plans, Specifications and Estimates (PS&E) and, finally, Construction. The full circle Compensation, Acquisition and Relocation All of the project alternatives currently under consideration require Right of Way (ROW) property acquisition and relocation. Likely to be one of the most challenging aspects of the project, ROW activities are of great concern to the community and the City of South Lake Tahoe and are subject to very strict state and federal laws and regulations. The TTD is receiving Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) funding to develop the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project. Whenever federal funds are used for a project, affected property owners and displaced residents and businesses are entitled to be justly compensated for losses they experience. The laws and regulations are also intended as a safeguard to ensure that federal funds are not unnecessarily or inappropriately expended. Right of way acquisition and relocation must comply with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended in 1987 (the Uniform Act). This law can be found in Chapter 10 of the Caltrans Right of Way Manual, the FHWA Project Development Guide (Appendices A and B) and at Section 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 24. Noncompliance with the Uniform Act can result in ineligibility for reimbursement of project costs, including both ROW and construction. The project must also comply with all requirements of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act for federal-aid projects. This guarantees that all services and/or benefits derived from any ROW activity will be administered without regard to race, color, gender, or national origin. According to Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) policy, state DOTs are ultimately responsible for ROW activities on federal-aid projects. Essentially, this places the responsibility on Caltrans and NDOT for the TTD’s actions within their respective jurisdictions. These actions will follow Caltrans’ procedures. A review of both DOTs’ ROW processes determined that Caltrans’ are generally more comprehensive, ensuring that federal funding eligibility is retained. To evaluate residential requirements, a Relocation Assistance Study (RAS) was prepared. The study began with interviews of affected residents, analyses of their demographics, an estimate of the number of dwelling units impacted and a survey of available replacement properties. The completed RAS includes a summary of relocation needs and requirements, an outline of a project-specific relocation process, an overview of rules and regulations pertaining to residential relocation and a cost estimate. The RAS also addresses potential business impacts. Following are some of the key points relating to ROW property acquisition and residential and business relocation. For more detailed information, please refer to the RAS and/or the Uniform Act. (Note: pursuant to the Uniform Act, acquisition and relocation cannot begin until a preferred alternative has been selected and agreed upon in the form of a certified environmental document.) Property Acquisition • Consistent with the Uniform Act, TTD will determine the amount of just compensation to be offered the property owner in a two-step process: -After researching the real estate market, a licensed appraiser will present an assessment of fair market value. -The assessment will be evaluated by a second appraiser who will recommend an amount to be approved by a TTD official as the agency's estimate of just compensation. Residential Relocation • Relocation assistance will be offered to displacees. • Relocation payment cannot be made unless the displaced person moves to a dwelling deemed decent, safe and sanitary. • Comparable replacement dwellings, in compliance with appropriate local housing codes, will be identified for displacees. • Although relocation assistance will be provided, displacees will ultimately choose where they want to live. Business Relocation • Relocation assistance will also be offered to displaced businesses. • Assistance may include: help with filing claims; identification of a potential new location; payment of eligible moving expenses and/or property improvements; reimbursement for eligible expenses incurred for replacement property search, re-establishing the business and/or loss of business goodwill. For a complete list and limitations, please refer to the RAS and/or the Uniform Act. Exploring the possibilities At least 15 alternative approaches for the US 50 South Shore Community Revitalization Project are or have been under consideration, complying with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). NEPA stipulates that all reasonable alternatives must be rigorously explored and objectively evaluated. Each alternative identified for further consideration must be substantially investigated so that reviewers may evaluate comparative merits. In addition, the statute requires a brief discussion/explanation of the reasons for considering, but rejecting, alternatives not carried forward for further analysis. Consideration must also be given to a “No Action” possibility. The “No Action” alternative is defined as the most likely future in the absence of the project. Like NEPA, CEQA specifies evaluation of a “No Project” alternative. The other alternatives considered by the Project Development Team (PDT), according to CEQA guidelines, should include those that could: 1) accomplish most of the basic objectives of the project (Purpose), and 2) eliminate or substantially mitigate one or more of the significant issues (Need) targeted by the project. The CEQA process only requires a detailed Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for alternatives that meet these guidelines. In other words, those meeting the goals of the “Purpose and Need Statement.” To document the review process, the PDT developed an Alternative Analysis Matrix (pages 16-20).

Local traffic and traffic from Pioneer Trail would use the existing US 50 above the tunnel and through traffic would utilize the tunnel.  Westbound traffic would enter the tunnel west of Lake Parkway and surface on US 50 west of Pioneer Trail. The approximate length of the tunnel is 3500 feet with 2500 foot transitions on each end of the tunnel. The tunnel width would include two 12foot lanes each way with a 4 foot wide center divider and sidewalk for emergency access.

The major difference being that with the North Park alternative, Pine Boulevard would not extend through Tahoe Meadows to the west intersection.  Rather, the North Loop Road would follow Pine Boulevard and then North Park avenue to the intersection of Park Avenue and Lake Tahoe Boulevard.  This would create a system where the north and south elements of the loop were offset at the west end. The section of Lake Tahoe Boulevard between the section between the Park Avenue and east intersections would be restriped to three lanes.  Implementing the North Park Alternative would require reconfiguration of the proposed Loop Road west intersection and the Park Avenue and Lake Tahoe Boulevard intersection.  In all other ways the North Park alternative would be the same as the three-lane alternative.

The project extends from 0.25 miles southwest of Pioneer Trail in South Lake Tahoe to Nevada State Route (SR) 207 (Kingsbury Grade) in Douglas County (see Exhibit 1). The project name is US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project (proposed project).  Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 (Section 4[f]) codified in Federal law at 49 United States Code (USC) 303, declares that “[i]t is the policy of the United States Government that special effort should be made to preserve the natural beauty of the countryside and public park and recreation lands, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and historic sites.” A similar provision was added to Title 23 USC 138, which applies only to the Federal-Aid Highway Program.  Section 4(f) specifies that “[t]he Secretary [of Transportation] may approve a transportation program or project… requiring the use of publicly owned land of a public park, recreation area, or wildlife and waterfowl refuge of national, State, or local significance, or land of an historic site of national, state, or local significance (as determined by the federal, state, or local officials having jurisdiction over the park area, refuge, or site) only if –  (1) there is no prudent and feasible alternative to using that land; and (2) the program or project includes all possible planning to minimize harm to the park, recreation area, wildlife and waterfowl refuge, or historic site resulting from the use.” Section 4(f) further requires consultation with the Department of the Interior and, to the extent applicable, the involved offices of the Departments of Agriculture and Housing and Urban Development in developing transportation projects and programs which use land protected by Section 4(f). (For the proposed project, the Departments of Agriculture and Housing and Urban Development are not involved in Section 4[f] compliance.) In general, a Section 4(f) “use” occurs with a DOT-approved project or program when 1) Section 4(f) land is permanently incorporated into a transportation facility; 2) when there is a temporary occupancy of Section 4(f) land that is adverse in terms of the Section 4(f) preservationist purposes, as determined by specified criteria (23 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 771.135[p][7]; and 3) when Section 4(f) land is not incorporated into the transportation project, but the project’s proximity impacts are so severe that the land’s activities, features, or attributes that qualify a resource for protection under Section 4(f) are substantially impaired (i.e., called constructive use) 23 CFR 771.135(p)(1) and (2).      Exhibit 1 Project Location   2 SECTION 4(f) DE MINIMIS IMPACT EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS Section 6009 (a) of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) amended 49 USC 303 and 23 USC 138 to allow the DOT to determine that certain uses of Section 4(f) land will have only “de minimis impacts” on a protected Section 4(f) resource. When this is the case, and the responsible official with jurisdiction over the resource agrees in writing, the Section 4(f) process is simplified.  The FHWA may determine that a transportation use of Section 4(f) property, after consideration of any impact avoidance, minimization, and mitigation or enhancement measures, results in a de minimis impact on that property. No further Section 4(f) evaluation is required, if a de minimis impact is found. De minimis impact findings must be made for the individual Section 4(f) resources when there are multiple resources present on a property. De minimis impact criteria and associated determination requirements are different for historic sites than for parks, recreation areas, and wildlife and waterfowl refuges.  For historic sites, de minimis impact means that FHWA has determined, in accordance with 36 CFR part 800 that no historic property is affected by the project or that the project will have “no adverse effect” on the historic property in question (23 CFR 774.17[1]).  For parks, recreation areas, and wildlife and waterfowl refuges, a de minimis impact is one that will not adversely affect the features, attributes, or activities qualifying the property for protection under Section 4(f) (23 CFR 774.17[2]). A de minimis impact determination requires agency coordination and public involvement as specified in 23 CFR 774.5(b). The regulation has different requirements depending upon the type of Section 4(f) property that would be used.  For historic sites, the consulting parties identified in accordance with 36 CFR 800 must be consulted. The official(s) with jurisdiction must be informed of the intent to make a de minimis impact determination and must concur in a finding of no adverse effect or no historic properties affected in accordance with 36 CFR 800. Compliance with 36 CFR 800 satisfies the public involvement and agency coordination requirement for de minimis impact findings for historic sites. Additionally, FHWA may make a de minimis finding only if the project would have no adverse effect on the historic site or other historic properties, the state historic preservation officer provides written concurrence, and the finding has been developed in consultation with the applicable parties [49 USC 303(d)(1)(A) and 49 USC 303(d)(2)]. (For the proposed project, no historic sites that qualify for Section 4[f] protection would be affected.) For parks, recreation areas, or wildlife and waterfowl refuges, the official(s) with jurisdiction over the property must be informed of the intent to make a de minimis impact determination, after which an opportunity for public review and comment must be provided. After considering any comments received from the public; incorporating all possible planning to minimize harm to the park, recreation area, and wildlife and waterfowl refuge; and if the official(s) with jurisdiction concurs in writing that the project will not adversely affect the activities, features, or attributes that make the property eligible for Section 4(f) protection, then FHWA may finalize the de minimis impact determination [49 USC 303(c), 49 USC 303(d)(1)(B), and 49 USC 303(d)(3)]. The public notice and opportunity for comment as well as the concurrence for a de minimis impact determination may be combined with similar actions undertaken as part of the NEPA process. (For the proposed project, the Section 4[f] resource considered for a de minimis impact is a public park.) 3 PURPOSE AND NEED FOR THE ACTION The overall purpose of this project is to make improvements to the US 50 corridor consistent with the Loop Road System concept referenced in historical planning documents, such as the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact (Table 1-1 in Chapter 1, “Introduction,” of the EIR/EIS/EIS); reduce congestion; improve vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle safety; advance multi-modal transportation opportunities; improve the environmental quality of the area; enhance visitor and community experience; and promote the economic vitality of the area. The project also provides the opportunity to develop a complete street—a street designed and operated to enable safe access for all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and transit riders of all ages and abilities—in the main tourist core of the Stateline area. The purpose and need for the project is further discussed in Chapter 1, “Introduction,” of the EIR/EIS/EIS. The project is proposed to address existing transportation deficiencies and future transportation needs along the US 50 corridor between Pioneer Trail and SR 207, to alleviate cut-through traffic in local neighborhoods in the City of South Lake Tahoe, to enhance pedestrian and bicycle safety and mobility, to improve transit access, and to support community revitalization goals. The community within the US 50 corridor has expressed a demand for transportation improvements to create well-designed, safer facilities that balance the needs of pedestrian, bicycle, transit, and private vehicle access while respecting the unique environmental setting of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Revitalization goals included creating more walkable, transit-served public space in the tourist/casino core through public and private investment, which would promote economic vitality. 4 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT ALTERNATIVES TTD is proposing to realign US 50 to circle around the south side of the tourist/casino core following the existing Lake Parkway alignment, which would achieve the goals and the purpose and need for the project summarized above.  To aid informed decision-making and public participation, an environmental review process has been conducted by TTD, including preparation of an environmental document (i.e., a joint environmental impact report pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), environmental impact statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and environmental impact statement pursuant to TRPA requirements [EIR/EIS/EIS]).  There are five project alternatives being considered for implementation, consisting of four build alternatives (Alternatives B, C, D, and E) and one no build alternative (Alternative A). Three build alternatives (Alternatives B through D) would construct a new roadway that would realign the existing US 50 from a point just west of the Pioneer Trail/US 50 intersection to the point where Lake Parkway meets US 50 in Nevada. In addition to the roadway realignment, all of the realignment alternatives (Alternatives B through D) would also include a new pedestrian bridge over the new US 50 alignment providing a connection between the tourist core and Van Sickle Bi-State Park, enhanced bicycle and pedestrian facilities and connectivity, enhanced transit features, environmental improvements, housing and business displacement, relocation assistance for displacees, and the potential for new mixed-use developments that could accommodate those that would be displaced. One build alternative (Alternative E) would construct a raised pedestrian walkway over the existing US 50 within the portion of the tourist core along the resort-casinos. A more detailed description of the alternatives is included in Chapter 2, “Proposed Project and Project Alternatives,” of the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS. 4.1.1 Alternative A: No Build (No Project or No Action) With Alternative A there would be no improvements to existing US 50, Lake Parkway, or other roadways within the project site boundaries. The current road alignment and lane configuration would remain the same, consistent with Exhibit 2-1 in Chapter 2 of the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS. At this time, no specific improvements to existing US 50 are planned. 4.1.2 Alternative B: Triangle (Locally Preferred Action) Alternative B would construct a new alignment of US 50 to the southeast of existing US 50 from just west of the Pioneer Trail intersection in California to Lake Parkway in Nevada. The new alignment would begin at a new Pioneer Trail intersection located to the west of the existing intersection, and proceed south along existing Moss Road. It would then turn east onto the Montreal Road alignment, passing behind (southeast of) the Heavenly Village Center shopping complex, and continuing along the existing Montreal Road and Lake Parkway alignments before ending at a new two-lane roundabout at the existing US 50/Lake Parkway intersection. Exhibit 2-2 of the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS provides an overview of the realignment of US 50, intersection improvements, and travel patterns associated with Alternative B (see Chapter 2 of the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS). ROAD NETWORK CHANGES AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS The new US 50 alignment would have four 11-foot wide travel lanes, 5-foot wide shoulders, and turn pockets at major intersections and driveways. New signalized intersections along the new US 50 would be located at Heavenly Village Way and the driveway entrance to Harrah’s. The existing segment of US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Lake Parkway would be relinquished to the City of South Lake Tahoe in California, and Douglas County in Nevada. New US 50 would become Caltrans and NDOT right-of-way. Between Park Avenue and Lake Parkway, the existing US 50 would be reduced to one travel lane in each direction, with landscaped medians, and left-turn pockets at major intersections and driveways. Bicycle lanes and sidewalks would be added and/or upgraded throughout the project site. A pedestrian bridge would be constructed over the new US 50 alignment approximately 250 feet south of the proposed new intersection at the Harrah’s entrance driveway near the California/Nevada state line connecting the Van Sickle Bi-State Park to the tourist core area. The bridge would likely include either a single-span, cast-in-place, concrete box girder design or steel truss bridge design. Aesthetic treatments would be included in the design and construction of the bridge to be compatible with the surrounding natural and human environment and to note the California/Nevada state line. The bridge would be designed to serve as an attraction for visitors to the area and a gateway into Van Sickle Bi-State Park from the tourist core.  On the mountain side of new US 50, the pedestrian bridge would connect to a 10-foot wide sidewalk that would run parallel to and extend the length of new US 50 to the main park entrance at Heavenly Village Way. The sidewalk would include a marked entrance crossing and connection to the existing sidewalk on the west side of the park entrance roadway. The sidewalk would be set back from the new retaining wall and topographically separated from new US 50 along most of its length.  On the lake side of new US 50, the pedestrian bridge would be connected to a new path that would run the length of the Conservancy parcel between the Harrah’s surface parking lot and Forest Suites Resort. The path would then either skirt around Bellamy Court on the existing sidewalk and connect with the sidewalk on the western side of Transit Way, or involve construction of a new path on the north side of Transit Way, leading users to the Explore Tahoe: Urban Trailhead building, which is an inter-agency visitor center designed to promote recreation and environmental education about Lake Tahoe. The improvements along Bellamy Court and Transit Way would be limited and would include striping and new signage directing visitors to the pedestrian bridge.  The location of the pedestrian bridge and connecting path is shown in Exhibits 2-2 through 2-4 in Chapter 2 of the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS and in the illustrations in Attachment 2 of this report. Exhibit 2-5 shows a conceptual illustration of the proposed pedestrian bridge as viewed from the proposed signalized entrance to Harrah’s. Exhibit 2-6 shows a conceptual illustration of the proposed pedestrian path on the Conservancy parcel extending from Bellamy Court to the proposed pedestrian bridge. Given the topography of the proposed new route for US 50, retaining walls would be needed along the southern side of the roadway. The retaining walls would be constructed in the area from the entrance road to Van Sickle Bi-State Park to about 900 feet east of Harrah’s Driveway. The walls would range in maximum height from 6 feet to 18 feet. The width of the paved surface of Lake Parkway currently varies from about 35 feet to 45 feet. The expanded four-lane roadway would range in width from 59 feet to 112 feet. The retaining walls would be given context-sensitive aesthetic treatments as depicted in the illustrations in Attachment 2 of this report. INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENTS Alternative B would result in modifications to the following intersections within the project site:  Existing US 50/New US 50/Pioneer Trail  Existing US 50/Park Ave/Heavenly Village Way  Existing US 50/La Salle Street  Existing US 50/Friday Avenue   Existing US 50/Stateline Avenue  New US 50/Heavenly Village  New US 50/Harrah’s Driveway  Existing US 50/New US 50/Lake Parkway  Stateline Avenue/Lake Parkway/Pine Boulevard The configuration of these intersections with Alternative B are shown in Exhibit 2-2 (see Chapter 2 of the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS). RIGHT-OF-WAY ACQUISITION NEEDS The Alternative B realignment of US 50 would require the acquisition of right-of-way. The right-of-way needs would include both partial and full acquisition of parcels within the project site. The number and type of affected parcels are listed in Chapter 2 and Appendix B of the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS. MIXED-USE REDEVELOPMENT SITES Alternative B includes the potential future redevelopment of three sites within the project site to include a mix of residential and commercial uses. The purpose of the redevelopment sites would be to provide potential relocation opportunities for dislocated residents and business owners close in the immediate vicinity. Exhibits 2-9 and 2-10 of the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS show the location and potential mix of uses that could be developed at these sites through a future public private partnership (see Chapter 2 of the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS). PARK ENTRANCE Alternative B includes extensive changes to the existing intersection at the entrance to Van Sickle Bi-State Park at Heavenly Village Way. The Heavenly Village Way/new US 50 intersection would be signalized and the width of the crossing to access Van Sickle Bi-State Park would increase from a 2-lane roadway crossing to a 4-lane roadway crossing. As shown in the illustrations in Attachment 2, context-sensitive design solutions, including new entrance signage, sidewalk improvements, and aesthetic pavement treatments, would be incorporated into the project to enhance the entrance to the park relative to existing conditions.  4.1.3 Alternative C: Triangle One-Way The alignment of Alternative C would be the same as Alternative B for the route along existing Montreal Road and Lake Parkway. However, Alternative C would involve one-way travel within the tourist core and on the realigned highway to the southeast. It would reduce right-of-way needs relative to Alternative B, as described herein. Exhibit 2-3 in Chapter 2 of the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS provides an overview of the roadway network, intersection improvements, and travel patterns associated with Alternative C.  ROAD NETWORK CHANGES AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS Alternative C would split eastbound and westbound directions on US 50 from the Park Avenue/Heavenly Village/US 50 intersection in California to Lake Parkway/US 50 intersection in Nevada. Eastbound US 50 would remain in place as under existing conditions, while westbound US 50 would be realigned onto a new alignment along Lake Parkway southeast of existing US 50. Both eastbound and westbound US 50 would have turn pockets at major intersections and driveways, and would add and/or upgrade bicycle lanes and sidewalks.  Travel lanes along the eastbound and westbound segments would be 11 feet wide. New signalized intersections would be located on westbound US 50 at Heavenly Village Way and the entrance driveway off existing Lake Parkway to Harrah’s. Caltrans and NDOT would be required to accept the right-of-way along both segments of US 50 for those portions in their respective state, and the City of South Lake Tahoe and Douglas County would need to relinquish the right-of-way along Lake Parkway, Montreal Road, and other local roadways affected by Alternative C. A pedestrian bridge would be constructed over westbound US 50 near the California/Nevada state line connecting the Van Sickle Bi-State Park to the Stateline area, as described above for Alternative B. INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENTS Alternative C would result in modifications to the same intersections identified for Alternative B above, but with configurations to accommodate one-way travel. RIGHT-OF-WAY ACQUISITION NEEDS The Alternative C realignment of US 50 would require the acquisition of right-of-way similar to that which would occur for Alternative B. The right-of-way needs would include both partial and full acquisition of parcels within the project site. The number and type of affected parcels are listed in Chapter 2 and Appendix B of the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS. MIXED-USE REDEVELOPMENT SITES Alternative C includes the potential future redevelopment of the same three sites within the project site as Alternative B for the purpose of providing relocation opportunities to the dislocated residents and business owners. PARK ENTRANCE Alternative C includes extensive changes to the existing intersection at the entrance to Van Sickle Bi-State Park, as described above for Alternative B. 4.1.4 Alternative D: Project Study Report Alternative 2 Alternative D is similar to Alternative B in that it would construct a new alignment for US 50 to the southeast of existing US 50 from the Pioneer Trail intersection in California to Lake Parkway in Nevada. The relocated US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection would be further north than the Alternative B alignment. Exhibit 2-4 in Chapter 2 of the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS provides an overview of the realignment of US 50, intersection improvements, and travel patterns associated with Alternative D. ROAD NETWORK CHANGES AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS The new US 50 alignment associated with Alternative D would begin at a reconstructed Pioneer Trail intersection, and proceed east on a new roadway between existing Echo Road and Fern Road. It would then turn north onto the Montreal Road alignment, passing behind the Heavenly Village Center shopping complex, and continuing along the existing Montreal Road and Lake Parkway alignments before ending at a new two-lane roundabout at the existing US 50/Lake Parkway intersection.  The new US 50 alignment would have four 11-foot wide travel lanes, 5-foot wide shoulders, and turn pockets at major intersections and driveways. New signalized intersections would be located at US 50/Heavenly Village Way and the driveway entrance to Harrah’s from US 50. The existing segment of US 50 between Pioneer Trail and Lake Parkway would be relinquished to the City of South Lake Tahoe in California and to Douglas County in Nevada. New US 50 would become Caltrans and NDOT right-of-way.  Between Park Avenue and Lake Parkway, the existing US 50 would be reduced to one lane in each direction, with landscaped medians and left-turn pockets at major intersections and driveways. Bicycle lanes and sidewalks would be added and/or upgraded throughout the project site. A pedestrian bridge would be constructed over the new US 50 alignment near the California/Nevada State Line connecting the Van Sickle Bi-State Park to the Stateline area, as described above in Alternative B.  INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENTS The intersection improvements associated with Alternative D would be the same as Alternative B, except the location of the relocated US 50/Pioneer Trail intersection; the alignment of this intersection would be further north relative to Alternative B. Alternative D also includes a proposed 2-lane roundabout at the US 50/Lake Parkway intersection with an option to signalize this intersection. RIGHT-OF-WAY ACQUISITION NEEDS The Alternative D realignment of US 50 would require the acquisition of right-of-way. The right-of-way needs would include both partial and full acquisition of parcels within the project site. The number and type of affected parcels are listed in Chapter 2 and Appendix B of the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS. MIXED-USE REDEVELOPMENT SITES Like Alternative B, Alternative D includes the potential future redevelopment of three sites within the project site to include a mix of residential and commercial uses that could be relocation opportunities for dislocated residents and business owners. Exhibits 2-11 and 2-12 of the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS show the location and a potential mix of uses that could be developed at these sites through a future public private partnership (see Chapter 2 of the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS). PARK ENTRANCE Alternative D includes extensive changes to the existing intersection at the entrance to Van Sickle Bi-State Park, as described above for Alternative B. 4.1.5 Alternative E: Skywalk Alternative E would feature a concrete deck over the entire width and length of existing US 50 within the tourist core between a location about 100 feet south of Stateline Avenue and a location near the northern end of the Montbleu Resort (about 450 feet south of Lake Parkway). The deck would serve as a pedestrian “skywalk” facility or pedestrian walkway along the resort-casinos. The width would be approximately 75 feet. The skywalk would be constructed on 4-feet wide columns spaced approximately 20 feet on center running along both sides of the highway for the entire length of the bridge. The purpose of the skywalk would be to enhance pedestrian facilities and separate pedestrians from the highway through the tourist core near the resort-casinos to allow for improved traffic flow. Alternative E would avoid the need to acquire property and displace uses and people in the existing community. Exhibit 2-13 in Chapter 2 of the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS shows a plan view illustrating the conceptual layout of Alternative E. ROAD NETWORK CHANGES The configuration of US 50 would remain as it is today, except that the signal and at-grade pedestrian scramble between Hard Rock and Montbleu would be removed. The improvements on Stateline Avenue would be the same as that which would occur for Alternative B.  INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENTS Alternative E would affect the following intersections in the project site:  US 50/Stateline Avenue  The signal and at-grade pedestrian scramble between Hard Rock and Montbleu RIGHT-OF-WAY ACQUISITION NEEDS Alternative E would be constructed entirely within the existing US 50 right-of-way and would not require any property acquisitions. Alternative E would not displace any residents or businesses.   MIXED-USE REDEVELOPMENT SITES Alternative E does not include the potential future redevelopment sites associated with Alternatives B through D. Because Alternative E would not displace any residents or businesses, it would not be necessary to provide replacement housing or commercial space as part of this alternative. 5 SECTION 4(f) RESOURCES The Section 4(f) properties that are located within the project site boundaries are shown on Exhibit 2. The resources within the project site include:  Van Sickle Bi-State Park straddling the California/Nevada state line south of Lake Parkway, with its main entrance located at the intersection of Heavenly Village Way and Lake Parkway.  Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course located at 100 Lake Parkway, on the northeast corner of the intersection of US 50 and Lake Parkway.  Friday’s Station located within the area of potential effect (APE), south of US 50 between Lake Parkway and SR 207.   Pony Express Rider statue located outside Harrah’s Lake Tahoe Casino Hotel and adjacent to US 50 within the center of the study area.  Lincoln Highway/ Lake Tahoe Wagon Road is a short segment of the former Lake Tahoe Wagon Road and Lincoln Highway and is located south of the intersection of US 50 and SR 207.     Exhibit 2 Existing Resources Evaluated for Section 4(f) Protection   6 PROPOSED SECTION 4(f) DE MINIMUS DETERMINATION 6.1 PUBLIC PARKS AND RECREATION AREAS - VAN SICKLE BI-STATE PARK Van Sickle Bi-State Park straddles the California/Nevada state line, located in City of South Lake Tahoe, California and Stateline, Nevada. The park opened in 2011. The Nevada Division of State Parks (NSP) and the California Tahoe Conservancy (Conservancy) jointly manage the park. The Nevada Division of State Land (NDSL) and the Conservancy each own the portion within their state.  The park encompasses approximately 720 acres, with the majority of the park located in Nevada (approximately 570 acres). The park has a forested landscape, dominated by a Jeffrey pine and white fir-mixed conifer with stream environment zones, historic buildings, large granite outcrops, and at higher elevations, broad views of Lake Tahoe. The park is situated between the tourist/casino core and Heavenly Ski Resort with the main access for vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles located at the intersection of Lake Parkway/Montreal Road and Heavenly Village Way/park entrance road. Parking is available within the park near the main entrance (Nevada Division of State Parks et al. 2005). The Van Sickle Bi-State Park Master Plan was prepared in 2005 by Nevada State Parks, California Division of Parks and Recreation, and California Tahoe Conservancy to guide the vision of the park. The Master Plan identified natural and cultural resources, outlined constraints on the site, and identified a plan for future uses. The following vision for the park was identified in the Master Plan:   To create a Bi-State Park with outstanding scenic and natural character for the protection of historical, archeological, ecological, geological, and other such values of statewide significance.   To create opportunities for compatible types of recreation.  Management will involve a balance between State agency operations, recreational resources and preservation of natural or cultural resources (Nevada Division of State Parks et al. 2005:28). The close proximity of the park to the concentrated bed base around the tourist/casino core provides visitors to the South Lake Tahoe and Stateline area with unique access to natural and cultural resources, as well as outdoor recreation opportunities that are within walking and biking distance of their lodging. Currently, visitors can use park facilities for picnicking, short or long day hikes, and biking. Trails within the park connect with nearby existing and planned regional trails, including the Tahoe Rim Trail, Daggett trail system, and South Tahoe Greenway. Historic structures within the park include a barn, small log cabin, and several housekeeping cabins all associated with a historic equestrian complex. Winter recreation opportunities within the park could include sledding, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing. Other features located within Van Sickle Bi-State Park include an easement for South Tahoe Public Utility District (STPUD) and the Heavenly gondola. The STPUD easement contains two water supply tanks. Access to the water tanks for STPUD is obtained via paved access road located approximately 500 feet northeast of the main park entrance. The Heavenly gondola extends southeast through the park from just north of the main entrance. Towers supporting the gondola are located in the park and an easement exists for the gondola and its supporting towers. A Sierra Pacific high voltage line with an associated easement extends northeast through a portion of the westernmost area of the park.  Currently, Van Sickle Bi-State Park has completed Phase I of its Master Plan. Future development of the park is planned to occur over the course of three more phases. Planned future visitor activities and facilities in the park will be expanded to include a visitor’s center, additional day use areas and parking, overnight cabins, and overnight camping that would include walk-in, group, and RV campsites. Interpretive signage regarding site history, natural resources, wildlife, and environmental stewardship is planned for the lower portion of the park near the main entrance and along trails throughout the park. Additionally, orientation signage will be installed at various locations in the park. Alternatives B, C, and D would require permanent use of the frontage of Van Sickle Bi-State Park for right-of-way and would result in indirect environmental effects on the park. The direct use and potential indirect impacts on Van Sickle Bi-State Park are summarized below. 6.1.1 Right-of-Way Acquisition Alternatives B, C, and D would require acquisition of a strip of Conservancy-owned land along the southwest frontage of the park (see Exhibits 3 and 4). No right-of-way acquisition is needed in Nevada. Alternatives B and D would acquire up to 0.47 acres and Alternative C would acquire up to 0.20 acres of Conservancy-owned land from the park. The amount of land within the park that would be acquired for the project right-of-way represents less than 0.1 percent of the total acreage of the park (720 acres).  The frontage of the park is along Lake Parkway and represents the visible landscape edge of the forest, which is a resource value important for the park. The frontage land does not contain recreational trails or other outdoor recreation facilities, but may be used for informal forest walking. One part of the frontage contains the entrance road, which is the main visitor access point. Visitors drive, bike, or walk across the frontage property to reach the interior of the park. This land also includes entrance signage for the park. Acquisition of land along the frontage of the park would not diminish continued access through the main entrance to the park. As part of the project, improvements to the park entrance would be made along construction of the new US 50/Heavenly Village Way/park entrance road intersection. The improvements would include a traffic-signal controlled pedestrian crosswalk and landscape design to enhance the arrival experience to the park. A visual simulation of improvements to the park entrance are shown in Exhibit 5. The small reduction in the size of the park resulting from the project’s right-of-way acquisition would not change the outdoor recreation resources, facilities, or activities or park. The landscape appearance of the park frontage would be changed, but would not be adversely affected. Use of natural materials, contoured grading, and tree replanting would create and attractive edge of the park visible from viewpoints along the new US 50 and walkways or sidewalks within the tourist/casino core. Resource attributes that qualify the resource for protection under Section 4(f) would either not be changed or, if altered, not be adversely affected.  6.1.2 Temporary Disruption of Access during Construction Alternatives B, C, and D would involve temporary, construction-related activities along the new US 50 immediately adjacent to Van Sickle Bi-State Park to implement roadway and intersection improvements, sidewalk installation and improvements, and construction of the pedestrian bridge connecting the tourist/casino core and the park. These construction activities would temporarily disrupt access to the park for vehicles and pedestrians because of the physical barriers caused by construction and the necessary safety zones that surround construction activities using heavy equipment. Because the project would implement Mitigation Measure 3.3-1 from the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS to establish detours and maintain access to public lands and recreation areas, the project would not adversely affect the activities, features, and attributes that qualify the resource for protection under Section 4(f). Furthermore, these construction activities would be considered a temporary occupancy of land and, thus, not considered a use within the meaning of Section 4(f) per 23 CFR 774.13(d) because:   construction activities that would disrupt access to Van Sickle Bi-State Park would be shorter in duration than the time needed for construction of the whole project;  the nature and magnitude of the construction activities would be minor, resulting in widening of an existing road and relocation of the entrance to the park;    Exhibit 3 Van Sickle Bi-State Park Right-of-Way Acquisition – Alternatives B and D   Exhibit 4 Van Sickle Bi-State Park Right-of-Way Acquisition – Alternative C  construction of the project would not adversely affect the activities, features, and attributes that qualify the resource for protection under Section 4(f) on a temporary or permanent basis;   the construction activities themselves, including any flaggers or temporary barriers such as cones or fencing, would not result in permanent changes beyond those that would result from acquisition of park property described in Section 6.1.1, above; and  written concurrence from Conservancy and NSP regarding the nature of the effects of construction activities on disruption of access to the park described herein is anticipated. 6.1.3 Noise The noise analysis in the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS (see Section 3.15, “Noise and Vibration”) considered noise impacts at key gathering areas in the park; the locations were determined in consultation with NSP and Conservancy staff and included existing gathering places, as well as future planned day-use and group camping facilities. Noise level changes at these locations would not be sufficient to be discernible at the modeled locations, as shown in Impact 3.15-3 (i.e., increases of less than 3 dB CNEL). People are able to begin to detect sound level increases of 3 dB in typical noisy environments [Caltrans 2013:2-45]). These less-than-significant noise level increases would occur, because the setback distance from the roadway edge, embankment next to the new US 50 alignment, intervening stand of trees, and topographical separation from the vehicles on the highway would attenuate the roadway noise. As such, Alternatives B, C, and D would not substantially diminish recreation user experience at these locations because of noise. For these reasons, the change in noise levels from increased traffic adjacent to the entrance to Van Sickle Bi-State Park, compared to current conditions and the No Project Alternative, would not adversely affect the park (Wood Rodgers 2013). Alternative C would also align the westbound new US 50 ROW along the existing Montreal Road and Lake Parkway; however, this alternative would not increase the number of lanes above the existing roadway lanes. The project’s noise generation would not adversely affect the activities, features, and attributes that qualify Van Sickle Bi-State Park for protection under Section 4(f). Noise generated by the project would not be considered a constructive use for the purposes of Section 4(f). 6.1.4 Visual Resources/Aesthetics The entrance appearance and arrival experience to the park would change with Alternatives B, C, and D, because the realigned highway would be wider than the current street and the entrance intersection would be redesigned, including traffic signal control. Context-sensitive design solutions have been developed with input from NSP and the Conservancy and incorporated into the project to provide safe, traffic signal controlled crosswalks, enhance the park entry design features, and create visible and attractive wayfinding for pedestrian and vehicle access. For example, the new pedestrian bridge connecting the tourist/casino core to the park would serve as a gateway, visibly demarking the state line California and Nevada. It would also enhance pedestrian and bicycle access to the park and provide an arrival experience for park users not currently offered. Retaining walls would include aesthetic treatments using natural materials, and the main crosswalk would include grander design features than exist today. See illustrations depicting these aesthetic features in Attachment 2 of this report.  As described in Section 3.7, “Visual Resources/Aesthetics,” recreation visitors to Van Sickle Bi-State Park would have little or no view of the highway once inside the park, because of screening by existing tree cover and topography, as well as replanting of trees where removal is unavoidable. Alternatives B, C, and D would not diminish recreation user experience within the park. For these reasons, the project would not have an adverse effect on the activities, features, and attributes that qualify the resource for protection under Section 4(f) from the visual changes that would occur with the realigned US 50 along Lake Parkway. Exhibit 5 presents an illustration of the proposed entrance changes.   Exhibit 5 Van Sickle Bi-State Park Entry Simulation6.1.5 Permanent Access Improvements Alternatives B, C, and D would include improved signage, paths, and trails for bicycles and pedestrians, a signalized crosswalk, and the construction of a pedestrian bridge over the new US 50, which would connect Van Sickle Bi-State Park to the tourist/casino core for pedestrians and bicyclists. This would result in an increase in public access compared to the single existing crosswalk at the stop-sign controlled intersection of Heavenly Village Way/Montreal Road/park entrance road. Alternatives B, C and D would also include intersection improvements at Heavenly Village Way to facilitate access to Van Sickle Bi-State Park by all transportation modes (i.e., automobile, pedestrian, bicycle, transit). The proposed pedestrian bridge and enhanced main entrance to the park would provide substantially improved access to the park with enhanced connectivity to the tourist/casino core. For these reasons, the project would result in a beneficial effect on the activities, features, and attributes that qualify the resource for protection under Section 4(f). 7 COORDINATION TTD, FHWA, Caltrans, the Conservancy, and NSP have coordinated regarding the project’s potential Section 4(f) impacts on Van Sickle-Bi State Park. TTD and FHWA have also coordinated with the California and Nevada State Historic Preservation Officers (SHPO). A summary of the coordination and consultation activities for the purposes of Section 4(f) is included in Table 2. Meeting notes from the Van Sickle Bi-State Park coordination meetings are included in Attachment 1 of this report. The outcome of these efforts are described below, under “Measures to Minimize Harm.” Table 2 Section 4(f) Evaluation Consultation Summary  Date  Form  Participants  General Topic(s)  January 10, 2014  Meeting  NSP, Conservancy, TTD, FHWA-CA, FHWA-NV, Caltrans, Wood Rodgers, Ascent Environmental  Discuss potential Section 4(f) issues related to Van Sickle Bi-State Park and next steps.  October 20, 2014  Meeting  NSP, Conservancy, TTD, FHWA-CA, FHWA-NV, Caltrans, Wood Rodgers, Ascent Environmental, Design Workshop  Discuss project effects on Van Sickle Bi-State Park and conduct site visit to support illustrations.  August 11, 2015  Meeting  NSP, Conservancy, TTD, Wood Rodgers, Ascent Environmental, Design Workshop  Review and discuss draft illustrations depicting project elements in the context of Van Sickle Bi-State Park.  January 21, 2016  Meeting  NSP, Conservancy, TTD, FHWA-CA, FHWA-NV, Wood Rodgers, Ascent Environmental  FHWA decision on use of the Joint Planning Exception; mitigation of impacts on Van Sickle Bi-State Park (e.g., pedestrian access to park, retaining wall aesthetic treatment, aesthetic treatment for entrance)  October 6, 2016  Letter sent seeking  Section 106 concurrence along with reports   California SHPO and Nevada SHPO  Submittal of California Archaeological Survey Report (ASR), Nevada ASR, California Historical Resources Evaluation Report (HRER), and the Nevada HRER for SHPO concurrence on conclusions.  Expected as part of the Final EIR/EIS/EIS and prior to Record of Decision  Section 4(f) Concurrence Letter  Conservancy and NSP  Concurrence with de minimis finding for Van Sickle Bi-State Park.   Expected as part of the Final EIR/EIS/EIS and prior to Record of Decision  Section 106 Concurrence Letter  California SHPO  Concurrence with findings in the California ASR and California HRER.  Expected as part of the Final EIR/EIS/EIS and prior to Record of Decision  Section 106 Concurrence Letter  Nevada SHPO  Concurrence with findings in the Nevada ASR and Nevada HRER.  Source: Compiled by Ascent in 2016  As discussed previously, cultural resource reports prepared for the project identified historic properties and evaluated the project’s impact on NRHP-eligible or listed properties in accordance with ACHP’s Criteria of Adverse Effect (36 CFR 800.5 [a][1]). The Architectural Inventory Report for the Nevada Portion of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project identified three historic properties within the Nevada portion of the study area that are on or are eligible for listing on the NRHP (NDOT 2015:32). The Draft Archaeological Survey Report for the California Portion of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project did not identify any historic properties within the California portion of the study area that are on or eligible for listing on the NRHP (Caltrans 2015:32). The cultural reports concluded that the project would not adversely affect any of the three historic properties. These cultural reports have been submitted to the California and Nevada SHPO as appropriate.  The public will have an opportunity to comment on this proposed Section 4(f) de minimis finding during a 60-day comment period beginning on XX, 2016 and ending on XX, 2016.  Coordination activities with California SHPO, Nevada SHPO, and the Conservancy can be completed after the comment period for the proposed Section 4(f) de minimis finding closes. If these agencies provide concurrence that there will be no adverse impacts, FHWA can determine that the effects of the proposed project on Section 4(f) resources are de minimis and the requirements of 23 USC 138 and 149 USC 303 would be satisfied. 8 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE HARM As a result of coordination between TTD, FHWA, Caltrans, Conservancy, and NSP, the following design features are incorporated into Alternatives B, C, and D to minimize the potential for adverse impacts on existing activities at Van Sickle-Bi State Park:  The pedestrian bridge overcrossing and trail connection leading to the Urban Trailhead visitor center in Heavenly Village and providing enhanced access between the tourist/casino core and the park. This enhances overall access and connectivity between the primary lodging/tourist activity areas and Van Sickle Bi-State Park. The pedestrian bridge provides a safe, grade-separated access for visitors crossing the new US 50 and a facility designed to attract visitors to the park, e.g., demarking the California/Nevada state line. Detailed design development will occur in coordination with Conservancy and NSP staff.   The aesthetic treatment of the retaining wall and graded slope along the park frontage on the mountain side of new US 50 was designed to maintain the rural, open space experience of the park, such as through the use of natural materials and tree replanting. Articulation (i.e., breaks in the wall, separated by landscaped area) and rock treatments were added to the retaining walls and context-sensitive design was applied.  The gateway/main entrance to Van Sickle-Bi State Park would be enhanced (Exhibit 5) and aesthetic crossing treatments would be used at the Heavenly Village/new US 50/park entrance road intersection.   9 SECTION 4(f) PRELIMINARY DE MINIMIS FINDINGS 9.1 PARKS, RECREATION AREAS, AND REFUGES A determination of de minimis impact on parks, recreation areas, and wildlife and waterfowl refuges, may be made when all three of the following criteria are satisfied: 1. The transportation use of the Section 4(f) resource, together with any impact avoidance, minimization, and mitigation or enhancement measures incorporated into the project, does not adversely affect the activities, features, and attributes that qualify the resource for protection under Section 4(f). Preliminary Finding: As described herein, the small amount of parkland to be permanently incorporated into the project right-of-way would be less than 0.1 percent of the acreage of the Van Sickle Bi-State Park. Additionally, potential impacts of the project related to visual resources and noise would not adversely affect the activities, features, and attributes that qualify the resource for protection under Section 4(f).  The project would result in beneficial effects related to public access and connectivity between the tourist/casino core and the park, which would be enhanced through:  improved signage, paths and trails for bicycles and pedestrians,   intersection improvements at Heavenly Village Way,   a signalized crosswalk, and   the construction of a pedestrian bridge over the new US 50. 2. The public has been afforded an opportunity to review and comment on the effects of the project on the protected activities, features, and attributes of the Section 4(f) resource. Preliminary Finding: This preliminary finding will be released and made available for public comment for a period of 60 days, concurrent with the public comment period for the Draft EIR/EIS/EIS, which will include a combined public hearing. FHWA will consider all comments on the proposed de minimis impact finding prior to issuing a final finding. 3. The official(s) with jurisdiction over the property are informed of DOT's intent to make the de minimis impact determination based on their written concurrence that the project will not adversely affect the activities, features, and attributes that qualify the property for protection under Section 4(f). Preliminary Finding: TTD informed the Conservancy and NSP of the proposed de minimis impact finding proposed to be made by FHWA. After the public comment period ends and if Alternatives B, C, or D is selected as the preferred alternative, FHWA would written seek concurrence from the Conservancy and NSP that the project would not adversely affect the activities, features, and attributes that qualify the resource for protection under Section 4(f). Based on the proposed findings to date, Alternatives B, C, and D would result in a de minimis impact on Van Sickle Bi-State Park. 10 OTHER RESOURCES EVALUATED RELATIVE TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 4(F) 10.1 WILDLIFE/WATERFOWL REFUGES – EDGEWOOD TAHOE GOLF COURSE TRPA has identified 18 waterfowl management areas within the Tahoe Region. One of the management areas is located at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course, which is within the northwestern portion of the study area, outside of the project footprint. The Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course is a privately-owned, 18-hole course with a driving range, putting green, and a clubhouse with dining facilities located within the study area. The Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course is open to the public except for during special events such as the American Century Celebrity Championship.  Waterfowl management areas are scored by on-going assessments of habitat conditions, recreation impacts, and a review of management actions that could affect waterfowl at the 18 mapped waterfowl sites. The recreational impact and habitat intactness score for the 18 waterfowl threshold sites are ranked 1 to 4 with 1 being the most intact and 4 being the most disturbed. The Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course has a rank of 4 (LTSTMEP 2012).  The waterfowl threshold site at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course is well-recognized as being artificial and altered by intensive golf course operations and use. However, the artificial ponds on the golf course support considerable numbers of waterfowl, which is presumably why the site was designated as a threshold area. These areas are primarily used for foraging and resting. Nesting habitat for waterfowl species within the golf course is limited due to lack of extensive riparian vegetation or other naturalized areas that may provide adequate cover and limited buffer distance between golf course play and wetland/open water habitats. However, small areas of nesting habitat may exist in areas near the ponds where vegetation cover is relatively dense (TRPA 2012:5.7-69). A wildlife or waterfowl refuge may be considered a Section 4(f) property if it is publicly owned, formally part of the National Wildlife Refuge System, or other publicly owned land where the major purpose of such land is the conservation, restoration, or management of endangered species, their habitat, and other wildlife and waterfowl resources and their habitat. The Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course waterfowl threshold site is privately-owned land, which generally precludes a site from eligibility as a Section 4(f) property. However, if a governmental body has a permanent property interest in the land (such as a permanent easement, or in some circumstances, a long-term lease), FHWA determines on a case-by-case basis whether the particular property should be considered publicly owned and, thus, if Section 4(f) applies.  While the Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course land is encumbered with an easement for a public access to Lake Tahoe, it is not for purposes of wildlife or waterfowl protection. Therefore, without a permanent public property interest as a wildlife or waterfowl refuge, the Edgewood Golf Course property does not qualify as this category of Section 4(f) resource.  10.2 HISTORIC PROPERTIES LISTED OR ELIGIBLE FOR THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES Among those statutes enacted by Congress that affect historic properties, the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA) is the most important federal law that addresses historic preservation. Among other things, the NHPA establishes the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), the official list of designated historical resources. Districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects may be eligible for listing in the Register. Nominated resources are listed if they are significant in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture in a manner that meets NHPA criteria. The NRHP is administered by the National Park Service. To be eligible, a property must be significant under criteria A through D (described below); and ordinarily be 50 years of age or older. A.  Are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our  history; or B.  Are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or C.  Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of installation, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or D.  Have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history. Properties that are in or determined to be eligible for listing in the NRHP (including historic districts, buildings, structures, objects, and certain archaeological sites) qualify for Section 4(f) protection. The Architectural Inventory Report for the Nevada Portion of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project identified three historic properties within the Nevada portion of the study area that are on or are eligible for listing on the NRHP (NDOT 2015:32). The Draft Archaeological Survey Report for the California Portion of the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project did not identified any historic properties within the California portion of the study area that are on or eligible for listing on the NRHP (Caltrans 2015:32).  The cultural resources reports identified above and the Cultural Resources Study for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project [TRPA 2015] prepared for the project identified a number of other cultural resources that are either ineligible for listing on the NRHP or will not be affected by the project due to their distance from project activities or because they are screened by fencing or vegetation from project activities (NDOT 2015, Caltrans 2015). These resources will not be further discussed in this report.  Under federal law, the Criteria of Adverse Effect are set forth by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) in its implementing regulations, 36 CFR Part 800. As codified in 36 CFR Part 800.4(d)(2), if historic properties may be affected by a federal undertaking, the agency official shall assess adverse effects, if any, in accordance with the Criteria of Adverse Effect.  The Criteria of Adverse Effect (36 CFR 800.5 [a][1]) reads: An adverse effect is found when an undertaking may alter, directly or indirectly, any of the characteristics of a historic property that qualify the property for inclusion in the [NRHP] in a manner that would diminish the integrity of the property’s location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, or association. Consideration shall be given to all qualifying characteristics of a historic property, including those that may have been identified subsequent to the original evaluation of the property’s eligibility for the [NRHP]. Adverse effects may include reasonably foreseeable effects caused by the undertaking that may occur later in time, be farther removed in distance or be cumulative.  36 CFR 800.5 (a)(2) reads: Adverse effects on historic properties include, but are not limited to:  (i)  Physical destruction of or damage to all or part of the property;  (ii)  Alteration of a property, including restoration, rehabilitation, repair, maintenance, stabilization, hazardous material remediation, and provision of handicapped access, that is not consistent with the [secretary of the interior’s] Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties (the Standards) (36 CFR part 68) and applicable guidelines;  (iii)  Removal of the property from its historic location;  (iv)  Change of the character of the property’s use or of physical features within the property’s setting that contribute to its historic significance;  (v)  Introduction of visual, atmospheric or audible elements that diminish the integrity of the property’s significant historic features;  (vi)  Neglect of a property which causes its deterioration, except where such neglect and deterioration are recognized qualities of a property of religious and cultural significance to an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization; and  (vii) Transfer, lease, or sale of property out of Federal ownership or control without adequate and legally enforceable restrictions or conditions to ensure long-term preservation of the property’s historic significance. 10.2.1 Friday’s Station (National Register Inventory #86003259) Friday’s Station is located within the northeastern portion of the APE for the project, which is shown in Exhibit 2. Friday’s Station is a two-and-one-half story, frame building constructed in 1860 as an inn and Pony Express Station. It is a Greek Revival-style building sitting amidst a vast expanse of closely-mowed turf, which lends the property the feeling of an antebellum southern estate. Friday’s Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 and is National Register Inventory #86003259. The property is currently privately owned by Edgewood Companies (Edgewood Companies 2014). The project’s potential effects to Friday’s Station are assessed here under criteria i, iv, and v of ACHP’s Criteria of Adverse Effect described above. Under criterion i, the project’s direct effects would be confined to a corridor near the roadways along the perimeter of the property and would not destroy or damage any of the buildings associated with Friday’s Station. Under criterion iv, the project would not change the property’s use or physical features, as the project’s direct effects would be confined to a corridor near the roadways at the perimeter of the property. Under criterion v, the project would not affect the property’s visual, atmospheric, or audible elements, as the property’s buildings are 400 feet from project improvements and visually separated from the project by a dense stand of trees. The project would not diminish those aspects of integrity that enable Friday’s Station to convey its significance. The project would not result in a change in land ownership or use of the property, and no permanent, adverse physical impacts are expected to occur. 10.2.2 Pony Express Rider Statue The Pony Express Rider bronze statue is located outside Harrah’s Lake Tahoe Casino Hotel and is adjacent to US 50 within the center of the study area. The statue’s location is identified on Exhibit 2. This statue was dedicated as a commemorative marker of the pony express in 1963 over 100 years after the first Pony Express Rider passed through the area. This statue is one of two commissioned by Bill Harrah in 1961 and designed by noted 20th century American sculptor Avard Tennyson Fairbanks. The other statue is located outside Harrah’s casino in north Kansas City, Missouri. According to Criterion C for determining a resource’s significance for NRHP listing, the Pony Express Rider statue appears eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. The statue’s eligibility is a result of the statue’s embodiment of the aesthetic vision and artistic skills of a master, Fairbanks, in creating an object in bronze that reflects the western identity so closely tied to the Pony Express and the opening of the American West to Euro-American technology, communication, and assimilation. The project’s potential effects on the Pony Express Rider statue outside Harrah’s Lake Tahoe Casino Hotel are assessed here under criteria i, iv, and v of ACHP’s Criteria of Adverse Effect described above. Under criterion i, the project’s direct effects would be confined to a corridor near the US 50 roadway west of the statue, and would not destroy or damage the statue or any of the aspects of the statue’s setting associated with it. Under criterion iv, the project would not change the property’s use or physical features, as the project’s direct effects would be west of the statue. Under criterion v, if the proposed project constructs a skywalk (Alternative E) above US 50 between Harrah’s Lake Tahoe Casino Hotel and Harvey’s Lake Tahoe, the project may affect the statue’s visual, atmospheric, or audible elements, as the statue is located outside in a visually prominent location outside Harrah’s Lake Tahoe Casino Hotel near US 50. However, the statue’s artistic qualities that make it eligible for the NRHP would not change and the project would not diminish those aspects of integrity that enable the Pony Express Rider statue to convey its significance. The project would not result in a change in land ownership or use of the property, and no permanent, adverse physical impacts are expected to occur. 10.2.3 Lincoln Highway/Lake Tahoe Wagon Road/26 Do 451/KBG-4 This resource is located in the Nevada portion of the study area and consists of a short segment of the former Lake Tahoe Wagon Road and Lincoln Highway and was built in 1863 and later became a segment of the Carson Branch of the Lincoln Highway, the first transcontinental automobile route in the United States. In a 2006 report, the segment appears eligible for inclusion in the National Register under Criterion A for its strong association with the themes of communication and transportation, and Criterion C for its qualities of construction. The project’s potential effects to resource 26 Do 451/KBG-4 (segment of the Lincoln Highway) are analyzed here under criteria i, iv, and v of ACHP’s Criteria of Adverse Effect described above. Under criterion i, the project’s direct effects would be confined to NDOT right-of-way by a chain link right-of-way fence. The resource is situated outside the right-of-way, on private land protected by the chain link fence. The project would not destroy or damage 26 Do 451/KBG-4. Under criterion iv, the project would not change the property’s use or physical features, as the project’s direct effects would be confined to the NDOT right-of-way. Under criterion v, the project would not affect the property as it is visually separated from project improvements by the chain-link fence, boulders, vegetation, and trees. Improvements to US 50 in the vicinity of 26Do451/KBG-4 would not significantly exacerbate the existing visual, atmospheric, or auditory setting caused by the presence of a modern, heavily travelled modern road in the right-of-way. The project would not diminish those aspects of integrity that enable 26 Do 451/KBG-4 to convey its significance. The project would not result in a change in land ownership or use of the property, and no permanent, adverse physical impacts are expected to occur. 11 CONCURRENCE FROM OFFICIALS WITH JURISDICTION Following the public comment period from XX, 2016 to XX, 2016, the officials with jurisdiction (Conservancy and NSP, California SHPO, and Nevada SHPO) will provide their concurrence in order to fulfill all of the requirements of Section 4(f).

The US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project (the Project) would realign US 50 in the Stateline casino corridor area and convert the existing US 50 roadway, between a location southwest of Pioneer Trail in California and Lake Parkway in Nevada, into a two‐lane roadway (one travel lane in each direction) with a center, landscaped median and turn pockets at major driveways and intersections. Expanded sidewalks and bicycle lanes would be constructed in this section within the casino corridor to improve pedestrian safety and encourage use of alternative transportation modes, and traffic signals would be installed and synchronized to improve the flow of traffic. The Project is located along US Highway 50, from approximately 0.25 miles west of Pioneer Trail within the City of South Lake Tahoe, California to Nevada Route 207 within Douglas County, Nevada. The portion of the Project that is located within California is subject to oversight and approval by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). Likewise, the portion of the project that is located in Nevada is subject to review and approval by the Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT).  Additionally, since the project is also part of the federal highway system, the project is also subject to review and approval by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) offices located in California and Nevada. The proposed project includes a total of five alternative, which includes a no build alternative (Alternative A) and one that is completely within existing right of way (Alternative E – Skywalk Alternative). There are three alternatives which require acquisition of property in both the State of California and the State of Nevada for the project. The most invasive Alternative B requires 74 parcels in the State of California and 11 parcels in the State of Nevada. Alternative C requires 56 parcels in the State of California and 9 parcels in the State of Nevada. Alternative D requires 55 parcels in the State of California and 11 parcels in the State of Nevada. A parcel is considered to be one Assessor’s Parcel Number. TABLE 1: TOTAL PARCEL FOR EACH ALTERNATIVE  Alternative  Total Parcels  California Parcels  Nevada Parcels  Government Zoned Parcels  Residential Zoned Parcel  Commercial Zoned Parcels  Motel Parcels*  B  85  74  11  12  41  31  2  C  65  56  9  11  32  22  3  D  66  55  11  13  26  27  1  * Motel parcels are included in total Commercial parcels The three alternatives require 13.017 acres, 9.761 acres and 11.172 acres for Alternatives B, C and D respectively in both California and Nevada. There are three proposed alternatives that would require displacement of residents and/or businesses; Alternative B; Alternative C; and Alternative D. Alternatives C and D both include approximately a total of 64 displacement units for residential and businesses along two different alignments. Alternative B would have a more invasive impact and includes approximately a total of 97 residential and business displacement units.  There are also motel parcels that are impacted. Generally, each motel (considered one commercial establishment) is one business displacement. The motel rooms are generally occupied by day use occupants who are not considered eligible for relocation benefits and are not considered as a displacee. The number of rooms impacted varies from 16 to 90 on 1 to 3 motel parcels depending on the alternative. Commercial or residential structures located within the proposed acquisition area impacted by the preferred alternative (when selected) of the road realignment will be acquired and improvements will be removed. Approximately, 55 to 74 properties in California and 9 to 11 properties in Nevada may be purchased in partial or full acquisitions by TTD for Alternatives B, C and D for the construction of the project based on which alternative is selected as the preferred alternative. TABLE 2: TOTAL RESIDENTIAL AND BUSINESS DISPLACEMENT UNITS BY ALTERNATIVE  Alternative  Total Number of Displacement Units  Total Residential Displacement Units  Single Family Displacement Units  Multiple Family Displacement Units  Total Business Displacement Units  Motel Business Displacement Units*  Motel Rooms  B  97  92  15  77  5  2  58  C  64  61  7  54  3  3  90  D  64  47  5  42  6  1  16  * Motel parcels are included in total Business Displacees A residential displacement units is a single family residence, a unit in a duplex or triplex and unit in an apartment building. Because of the potential displacements; to proceed with the Project, TTD has certain statutory relocation obligations among which is the need to prepare a relocation plan which provides required demographic and planning information and sets forth the policies and procedures necessary to conform with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 as amended (42 U.S.C. 4601 et seq.) (The Uniform Act). The following relocation study document is a component of the Community Impact Assessment and the Environmental Assessment. This Study was commissioned by the TTD and written by Bender Rosenthal, Inc. (BRI), a professional consulting firm specializing in commercial valuation and right of way services including relocation assistance. The Study is organized in five sections: 1. The regional and specific location of the Project (SECTION I); 2. An assessment of the relocation needs of those persons subject to displacement as a result of the Project (SECTION II); 3. An assessment of replacement housing opportunities within the City of South Lake Tahoe area (SECTION III); 4. A description of the policies and procedures that TTD will follow to meet displacee needs and ensure compliance with federal law (SECTION IV); and 5. Administrative provisions summarizing relocation policy and procedure for the proposed Project (SECTION V). I. PROJECT SITE LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION A. REGIONAL SETTING The Project is located along US Highway 50, from approximately 0.25 miles west of Pioneer Trail within the City of South Lake Tahoe, California to Nevada Route 207 within Douglas County, Nevada. (See Figure 1). Figure 1: Regional Project Location B. SPECIFIC PROJECT LOCATION The project area includes the US 50 corridor and vicinity between an area southwest of the Pioneer Trail/US 50 Intersection in the City of South Lake Tahoe, California and SR 207 in Douglas County, Nevada, as well as the land generally bounded by Lake Parkway East, Montreal Road, and Echo Road on the southeast side, or “mountain side”, of the existing US 50. The biggest concentration of residential parcels for the alternatives that would require relocation is located in Pioneer Trail, Echo Road, Primrose Road, Fern Road and Moss Road. (See Figure 2 for details). Figure 2: Specific Project Site C. GENERAL DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS According to the 2010 U. S. Census, the population of the City of South Lake Tahoe is 21,124 (see Table 3). Corresponding Census data concerning the housing mix is shown in Table 4. TABLE 3: PROJECT POPULATION –CITY OF SOUTH LAKE TAHOE  Population  City  %  Total Population  21,124  100.0%  White  12,820  60.7%  Black or African American  193  0.9%  American Indian and Alaska Native  235  1.1%  Asian  1,177  5.6%  Pacific Islander  43  0.2%  Hispanic or Latino (of Any Race)  6,656  31.5%  TABLE 4: PROJECT HOUSING UNITS –CITY OF SOUTH LAKE TAHOE  Type  City  %  Total Units  15,087  Vacant Housing Units  6,169  Occupied Housing Units  8,918  100%  Owner-Occupied  3,473  38.9%  Tenant-Occupied  5,445  61.1%  II. ASSESSMENT OF RELOCATION NEEDS A. SURVEY METHODOLOGY To obtain information necessary for the preparation of this Study, personal interviews were conducted among the project area residents of the proposed alternatives. These interviews were conducted over a period of three years and reflect the neighborhood occupants of the alternatives. As the alternatives changed over the years, the additional interviews were conducted to supplement the initial information. Interviews were conducted on-site, in English or Spanish, as appropriate. The residential survey neighborhood is generally defined along Moss Road, Echo Road and Fern Road from Montreal Road to Pioneer Trail. This is predominantly the area where the residential displacements occur. The survey numbers represent a sampling of the occupants and not all occupants were available or willing to answer survey questions for Alternatives B and C. On Alternative D the sampling, conducted three years ago, totaled 88 respondents. Several occupied dwelling units have been dropped from that alignment. The impacted occupied parcels exceeded the current 66 parcels with 47 residential unit displacements A more recent sampling was obtained for Alternative B and Alternative C summer of 2014. The sampling consisted of a total of 56 respondents in 56 dwelling units. A dwelling unit is a single family residence or an apartment unit in a multi-family building. The sampling for Alternative D is still valid as many of the units are located in the current alignment requirements. Some of the properties occupied by the respondents have been dropped form the project. The sampling provides a general perspective of the status and characteristics of occupancy for that alternative. Inquiries made of residential occupants concerned household size and composition, income, monthly rent obligation, length and type of occupancy, ethnicity, home language, disabilities/health problems, and replacement housing preferences.1 Sample survey form is presented in Exhibit A. The descriptive data in this Study concerning residents are based solely on anecdotal responses. No attempt was made at this stage to qualify information obtained from residents. 1 All interviews and associated information provided was provided voluntarily and at the discretion of the individual. B. SURVEY DATA Surveys were conducted with willing participants to obtain a sampling of needs of displaces from the various alternatives. Eligibility for relocation assistance is determined at the time of the first written offer. Because of the nature of occupancy in resort area, it is unknown if any of the respondents will be in occupancy at the time of displacement and determination of eligibility. The Survey for Alternative B and Alternative C conducted in early summer of 2014 included 56 respondents. The respondents were located in 56 dwellings units of which 55 were tenant occupied dwelling units that may qualify for relocation benefits. There was 1 owner-occupied respondent living in a 3bedroom residence that would qualify for relocation benefits. The tenant-occupied units range from zero to 4-bedroom dwellings. The survey information for Alternative D was obtained three years ago from 84 respondents of the combined 88 tenant-occupied units and owner-occupied units. Subsequent to this survey, the number of parcels has been reduced. Some of these dwelling units surveyed are also located in current Alternatives B and C.  The Surveys for Alternative D included 84 respondents in a total of six single family residential parcels of which one is owner-occupied and 11 multifamily residential parcels with 83 tenant-occupied dwelling units that may qualify for relocation benefits. At the time of the survey there were additional multi-family units impacted on an expanded alignment. Some of those properties surveyed have been dropped from the project. The owner-occupied units range from zero-to three-bedroom, and the tenant-occupied units from zero to four-bedroom dwellings. The current alignment for Alternative D only has 47 residential displacement units. The survey still provides a good sample of the variety of project relocation requirements. The data obtained from respondent households or from property owners or site managers sources are presented in this section. 1. Description of Dwelling Units Required The project area for Alternative B and C includes 31 and 25 residential parcels respectively, improved with multi-family and single family structures. Of the 56 respondent households, 15 reside in studio/loft type dwellings, 11 reside in one-bedroom units, 26 reside in two-bedroom units, 1 resides in a three-bedroom residence, and 3 in four-bedroom residences. The project area for Alternative D includes 17 land parcels improved with multifamily and single-family structures. Of the 84 respondent households, 19 reside in studio/loft type dwellings, 30 reside in one-bedroom units, 30 reside in two-bedroom units, 4 reside in three-bedroom units and 1 in a four-bedroom single family residence. Generally throughout the project area, units were observed to be in fair to good condition. The primary occupants of the project area are tenants. There are one to three owner occupants within the current project alternatives. The information is included in Tables 5 & 6 below. TABLE 5: PROJECT AREA HOUSING –DWELLING BEDROOM SIZES ALTERNATIVE B AND ALTERNATIVE C  No. of Bedrooms  Zero (studio/loft)  One  Two  Three  Four  No. of Units  15  11  26  1  3  TABLE 6: PROJECT AREA HOUSING –DWELLING BEDROOM SIZES ALTERNATIVE D  No. of Bedrooms  Zero (studio/loft)  One  Two  Three  Four  No. of Units  19  30  30  4  1  2. Project Area Rents If the Alternative B or the Alternative C is selected, approximately 92 to 61 tenant household will be affected, and their monthly rental payments range from $350 to $1,400.00 based on the survey There are at approximately 47 tenant households to be affected by the project if modified Alternative D is implemented. Their rent monthly payments range from $350.00 to $1,475.00 based on the survey. 3. Occupancy/Overcrowding The project respondent population of Alternative B and Alternative C totals 166 individuals. The average household size is three persons per dwelling unit. TABLE 7: CURRENT HOUSEHOLD SIZE OCCUPANCIES (56 RESPONDENTS SURVEYS)  No. in Household  One  Two  Three  Four  Five  Six  Seven  Eight  Nine  No. Households  15  10  8  15  6  0  0  1  1  The respondent population of Alternative D totals 245 individuals. The average household size is three persons per dwelling unit. TABLE 8:  CURRENT HOUSEHOLD SIZE OCCUPANCIES (84 RESPONDENTS)  No. in Household  One  Two  Three  Four  Five  Six  Seven  Eight  No. Households  16  25  17  12  8  3  2  1  For the purposes of this Study, an occupancy standard has been applied which states that a maximum of two persons may occupy a zero-bedroom unit such as a studio apartment. For units larger than zero-bedroom units, two persons per bedroom shall be used as a guideline in determining the number of bedrooms required for replacement housing. More than two persons may occupy a bedroom provided the room is adequate in size to accommodate normal bedroom furnishings for the room occupants (e.g., three toddlers in a larger bedroom, an infant in the bedroom with the parents). If applicable housing and occupancy codes for the area of the comparable replacement require a greater number of bedrooms for the household than indicated by the above guidelines, the greater number of bedrooms according to codes should be used in the replacement housing valuation. Based on the latter criterion as compared to available project tenant data, there appear to be 4 overcrowded units among the respondents of the Alternative B and Alternative C and 11 overcrowded units among the respondents of Alternative D. Replacement housing referrals to all occupants will reflect the need for accommodations in a decent safe and sanitary unit, regardless of the size of the unit they currently occupy.  4. Replacement Housing Needs Replacement housing needs, as expressed in this Study, are defined by the total number of required replacement units and the distribution of those units by number of bedrooms. The projected number of required units by number of bedrooms is figured by comparing survey data relative to residents’ household size with the previously mentioned replacement housing occupancy standards. These standards, generally, allow for two persons in a bedroom and one in a living or non-sleeping room. The Project’s replacement housing requirements are to provide comparable units to replace the tenants’ displaced dwelling and correct overcrowding conditions, if applicable. The owner-occupied households will be referred to adequately sized units based on the Uniform Housing Code occupancy standard, yet providing not less bedrooms than their displacement unit. Referrals to comparable housing will be provided and attempts will be made to take into consideration individual preferences. The Project’s replacement housing requirements are summarized in Tables 9 and 10. TABLE 9: REPLACEMENT HOUSING NEEDS (56 RESPONDENTS) ALTERNATIVE B AND ALTERNATIVE C  Bedroom Size  Zero  One  Two  Three  Four  No. Needed-Tenants  11  13  27  0  4  No. Needed-Owners  0  0  0  1  0  TABLE 10: REPLACEMENT HOUSING NEEDS (84 RESPONDENTS) ALTERNATIVE D  Bedroom Size  Zero  One  Two  Three  Four  No. Needed-Tenants  17  30  28  3  1  No. Needed-Owners  2  0  2  1  0  The replacement needs will be reduced for Alternative D based on the modified alignment and that only 47 dwelling units are impacted.  The needs based on number of bedrooms for replacement housing is 20%23% for studios, 23%-35% for one bedroom and 48%-36% for two bedroom units and 9% -6% for larger units based on the alignment. 5. Income During the process of interviewing each household for this Study, an attempt was made to obtain as much voluntary information as possible regarding the household’s income. In most of the cases, the answers were vague or the interviewees preferred not to disclose the information. Respondents from the Alternative B and Alternative C did not provide any information regarding household incomes. Multiple households reported to work less than forty hours per week and earn minimum wage. Income information was provided by 10 respondent tenant households or 11.9% of Alternative D. According to income standards published by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for El Dorado County (Exhibit B) and adjusted for family size, of the respondents, nine Project households qualify as extremely-low income (31%-50% of area median income), and one as low income (51%-80% of area median income). TABLE 11: INCOME LEVELS OF TENANT HOUSEHOLDS (10 RESPONDENTS)  Extremely Low  Low  9  1  6. Ethnicity/Language Ethnicity among respondent Project households is White, Hispanic, and Asian with all households speaking some degree of the English language. Twenty-one households identified Tagalog (Philippines) as the primary language spoken at home. Twenty-two households reported to speak Tagalog and English. Thirty-four households identified Spanish as their primary language. Eight households said to speak Spanish and English at home. Fifty-one households identified English as the language spoken at home. Two households identified Visayan (Philippines) as the home’s primary language and two households identified Ilocano (Philippines) as the primary language spoken at home. 7. Senior/Handicapped Households There are seven known households with senior members (62 years or older) in Alternative B and Alternative C; and seven households in Alternative D. Although no households reported physical disabilities, mobility related issues could affect relocation process and preferences. Single story units or handicap ramps may be needed for some households at the replacement housing units. Care will be taken to meet the special needs of each household, including finding replacement homes near relatives and medical facilities. 8. Preferred Relocation Areas During the survey process, the households in all alternatives were asked as to which area they would prefer to relocate. Most of the Project residents surveyed expressed a preference to remain in or around the local community in order to maintain current access to schools, employment, medical facilities and transportation. This is consistent with the requirements of comparable replacement housing as described in section III.B. III. RELOCATION RESOURCES A. METHODOLOGY An extensive resource survey was conducted over a span of three weeks between December 2011 and January 2012; then over a two week span again in October 2013 and finally in August and September 2014 to determine the availability of replacement housing units in the South Lake Tahoe utilizing the following sources:  Rental property management agencies from the South Lake Tahoe area  Internet sources B. REPLACEMENT HOUSING AVAILABILITY 1. Residential For-Sale Housing Replacement housing survey data concerning available single-family dwellings in the area of South Lake Tahoe and surrounding communities are summarized in Tables 12 & 13. The survey identified a total of 54 available zero, one, two and three-bedroom units for sale. It should be noted that replacement housing identified in this table is only relative to the units required for those units that were identified to be owner occupied. TABLE 12: HISTORICAL AVAILABILITY AND COST OF FOR-SALE HOUSING –2011/2012  Bedroom Size  Zero/One  Two  Three  No. Found  10  22  11  Asking Price Range (in thousands)  $103-$240  $115-$325  $130-$259  Median Price  $142  $180  $200  The respondent information for Alternatives B and C were completed in early summer 2014 and resource information updated in August and September 2014.  Approximately 148 total current listings for residences were found. A sampling of 43 listings closest to the subject location provided the updated indications below. Based on the respondent surveys, very few residences are owner occupied. TABLE 13:  AVAILABILITY AND COST OF FOR-SALE HOUSING ALL ALTERNATIVE –2014  Bedroom Size  Zero/One  Two  Three  No. Found No. Needed)  2 (0)  10 (0)  18 (1-5)  Asking Price Range (in thousands)  $150-$240  $120-$350  $160-$350  Median Price  $195  $235  $255  The individual figures for number of units found by bedroom size are presented in the table alongside the number of units needed (shown in parentheses) to meet rehousing obligations. Survey data suggest a sufficiency of replacement housing resources relative to the number of potential displacements owning residences within the project area. The information on housing in the area is included as a general representation of available units currently on the market. No household will be required to move unless the comparable unit is located and is available on the market. As with any resource survey, results reflect conditions at a given point in time. The sites included herein may or may not be available at the time of displacement. Resource results are an indication and not a prediction of future market circumstances. However, based on the existing housing market both locally and nationally, it can be assumed that the availability of this housing stock will remain at or near this level for the next few years. TTD (or the project proponent), as the displacing agency, will be responsible to assist each household in relocating into comparable replacement housing, which for the purposes of this Study is determined to be housing that is in an area that is not generally less desirable than the current dwelling with regard to utilities, commercial facilities, schools and public services and is reasonably accessible to the displaced person’s current place of employment, is comparable in size and structure to the existing homes and which accommodates the size of the household being displaced. All replacement housing must meet decent, safe and sanitary requirements. In order to meet decent, safe and sanitary requirements, a replacement site must meet the following criteria:  Be structurally sound; weather tight and in good repair.  Contain a safe electrical wiring system adequate for lighting and other devices.  Contain a safe heating system capable of sustaining a healthful temperature.  Be adequate in size with respect to the number of rooms and area of living space needed to accommodate the displaced household. Separate, well-lighted and ventilated bathrooms that provide privacy to users and contains a sink, bathtub/shower, and a toilet, all in good working order connected to appropriate sources of water and sewage systems.  There shall be a kitchen area that contains a fully usable sink, connected to potable hot and cold water and to sewage drainage system, and adequate space and utility service connections for a stove and refrigerator.  Contain unobstructed egress to safe, open space at ground level, unless local fire and building codes require additional methods of ingress/egress such as access to a common corridor.  For a person who is mobility impaired, be free of any barriers, which would preclude reasonable ingress, egress, or use of the dwelling by such person. 2. Residential Rental Housing Based on the survey, Alternative B and Alternative C alternatives include fifty five households that are currently renting their units. The resource survey identified 29 available studios, 30 one-bedroom, 46 two-bedroom 11 three bedroom and 9 four-bedroom replacement dwellings available for rent based on availability in July 2014. Historical data collected for Alternative D three years ago is included below to provide and ongoing indication of available rental properties and trends in rental rates. The survey data is summarized in Tables 14 and 15. TABLE 14: AVAILABILITY AND COST OF RENTAL HOUSING –ALTERNATIVE B AND ALTERNATIVE C  RECENT SURVEY  Bedroom Size  Studio  One  Two  Three  Four  No. Found (No. Needed)  29(11)  30(13)  46(27)  11 (0)  9(4)  Monthly Rent Range  $450$750  $550$1342  $750$1450  $900$1800  $1320$3000  Median Market Rent  $575  $742  $1040  $1,350  $1871  TABLE 15: AVAILABILITY AND COST OF RENTAL HOUSING – INITIAL SURVEY  Bedroom Size  Studio  One  Two  Three  Four  No. Found  18  37  57  21  4  Monthly Rent Range  $468-$750  $514-$975  $699$1200  $870$2200  $1106$2000  Median Market Rent  $530  $614  $841  $1444  $1460  The South Lake Tahoe rental market consists of permanent occupants, seasonal occupants and short term vacation occupants.  There are many variables, however, there is ample availability of rental properties similar to the displacement units sampled. The following condition exist for rental housing as they did for purchasing a replacement site. TTD (or the project proponent), as the displacing agency, will be responsible to assist each household in relocating into comparable replacement housing, which for the purposes of this Study is determined to be housing that is in an area that is not generally less desirable than the current dwelling with regard to utilities, commercial facilities, schools and public services and is reasonably accessible to the displaced person’s current place of employment, is comparable in size and structure to the existing homes and which accommodates the size of the household being displaced. All replacement housing must meet decent, safe and sanitary requirements. In order to meet decent, safe and sanitary requirements, a replacement site must meet the following criteria:  Be structurally sound; weather tight and in good repair.  Contain a safe electrical wiring system adequate for lighting and other devices.  Contain a safe heating system capable of sustaining a healthful temperature.  Be adequate in size with respect to the number of rooms and area of living space needed to accommodate the displaced household. Separate, well-lighted and ventilated bathrooms that provide privacy to users and contains a sink, bathtub/shower, and a toilet, all in good working order connected to appropriate sources of water and sewage systems.  There shall be a kitchen area that contains a fully usable sink, connected to potable hot and cold water and to sewage drainage system, and adequate space and utility service connections for a stove and refrigerator.  Contain unobstructed egress to safe, open space at ground level, unless local fire and building codes require additional methods of ingress/egress such as access to a common corridor.  For a person who is mobility impaired, be free of any barriers, which would preclude reasonable ingress, egress, or use of the dwelling by such person. The information on housing in the area is included as a general representation of available units currently on the market. No household will be required to move unless the comparable unit is located and is available on the market. As with any resource survey, results reflect conditions at a given point in time. The sites included herein may or may not be available at the time of displacement. C. RELATED ISSUES 1. Concurrent Residential Displacement TTD has no concurrent projects nor is there any planned for the foreseeable future that could negatively impact the availability of needed housing resources. With the available units identified for this Study both tenants and owners will find ample alternate housing resources. Under no circumstances will any displacees be required to move without available replacement housing units. 2. Temporary Housing No need for temporary housing is anticipated. Should such a need arise, TTD will respond appropriately and in conformance with all applicable laws and requirements. . D.  BUSINESS REPLACEMENT 1. Non -Residential Properties All alternatives impact retail/commercially zoned properties. They consist of retail business units and motels. Several of the acquisitions are very small strip taking and will not require relocation from the property. The table below has the number of retail/commercial parcels and motel parcels currently impacted by the project. TABLE 16: RETAIL/COMMERCIAL AND MOTEL PARCELS  Alternative  Retail Parcels with Impacted Businesses [Non-Motel]  Retail Business Displacement Units  Motel Business Displacement Parcels  Motel Rooms  B  2  5  2  58  C  0  0  3  90  D  1  5  1  16  The second type of property requiring replacement analysis is commercial properties. Specifically, retail and motel properties. Local Multiple Listing services and Loopnet on line services provided the following information: TABLE 17:  RETAIL COMMERCIAL AND MOTEL PROPERTIES AVAILABLE  Type  Number  Price Range  Median Price  Motels  9  $599,000 to $2,600,000  $1599,500  Retail Commercial  9  $199,000 to $2,490,000  $1,344,500  o The replacement motels are generally non-branded with two of the upper end price range properties are branded.  The retail range is for a number of standalone buildings, two multiple tenant properties, and two small restaurants. 2. Business Relocations This section deals with the tenant occupied commercial properties.  Motel owners and retail/commercial owner occupants will be seeking replacement properties as identified in the previous section.  The project will have an impact on several retail/commercial tenant occupied properties.  Alternatives B and Alternative C would impact up to 5 and 3 commercial properties respectively. TABLE 18: BUSINESS DISPLACEMENTS  Alternative  Retail Parcels with Impacted Businesses [Non-Motel]  Retail Business Displacement Units  B  2  5  C  0  0  D  1  5  Some of the impacted properties have multiple businesses of which some could be permanently displaced. Alternative B and D have approximately five (5) businesses that could be affected in varying degrees from partial to full acquisitions. The exact impacts will become evident as the design progresses. Alternative B and Alternative C have five (5) commercial retail parcels where business units are impacted. As a result, they will need a full range of various types of assistance. In all cases, the business relocation assistance guidelines, as described in the Uniform Act will be followed. Every effort will be made to comply with the sponsoring agency’s (TTD or project proponent) desire to relocate all business displacees to areas within the South Lake Tahoe City Limits.  TABLE 19: RENTAL RETAIL COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES AVAILABLE  Type  Number  Price Range ($/SF)  Size Units (SF)  Retail Commercial  14  $0.76 to $2.00  350 – 6,995  As with the Residential Relocation Assistance contained in this Relocation Study, the Relocation Assistance Agent will employ all additional aid required to assist impacted businesses with their relocation needs including assistance in planning the logistics and executing the move of personal property and non-realty business property. Potential relocation benefits for business include a physical move of all personal property and related expenses to a new location. It includes packing and unpacking items. If appropriate, the move will include any dismantling or disconnecting and the reconnection at the replacement location. There are also search costs and reestablishment cost that are reimbursable.  California law provides that a business displacee may file a claim for the “Loss of Business Goodwill”. A claim form will be provided at the time of the appraisal.  The owner is responsible for providing proof of the loss which entails providing tax returns. IV. THE RELOCATION PROGRAM TTD will provide displacees the assistance, rights and benefits required under Federal relocation law and the relocation guidelines. The relocation program will provide both advisory and financial assistance. Every effort will be made to facilitate relocation arrangements and minimize hardships for displacees. A. ADVISORY ASSISTANCE Advisory assistance services are intended to inform displacees about TTD’s relocation program, help in the process of finding appropriate replacement accommodations, facilitate claims processing, maintain a communication link with TTD and coordinate the involvement of outside service providers.  To follow through on the advisory assistance component of the relocation program and assure that TTD meets its obligations under the law, relocation staff will perform the following functions:  Distribute written information concerning the TTD’s relocation program to each residential and commercial displacee (See Exhibit C);  Personally inform all displacees of the nature of and procedures for obtaining available relocation assistance and benefits;  Determine the eligibility, needs and relocation preferences of each residential and commercial displacee;  Provide residential displacees with at least three referrals to comparable, decent, safe and sanitary replacement housing within a reasonable time prior to displacement;  Maintain a database of available housing resources and commercial space and distribute replacement site referrals for the duration of the Project;  Provide transportation to displacees, if requested, to inspect replacement sites within the local area. Offer special assistance to help elderly residents find housing near friends, relatives, medical facilities and services and convenient transportation;  Make referrals to governmental and non-governmental service providers such as: (a) Federal Social Security Administration (b) Neighborhood Housing Services (c) Housing Commission (d) Home Loan Counseling Service (e) Department of Social Services  Assist each eligible displacee with the preparation and submission of relocation assistance claims;  Assist residential displacees with arrangements necessary to rent or purchase comparable decent, safe and sanitary replacement housing;  Make benefit determinations and payments in accordance with applicable Federal and State law and policy (if applicable);  Assure that no displacee is required to move without a minimum of 90 days written notice to vacate;  Inform all persons subject to displacement of TTD’s policies (if applicable) with regard to eviction and property management;  Establish and maintain a formal grievance procedure for use by displaced persons seeking administrative review of the benefit decisions with respect to relocation assistance; and  Provide assistance that does not result in different or separate treatment due to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status or other arbitrary circumstances. B. RELOCATION BENEFITS Relocation benefits will be provided in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Federal Relocation law and guidelines. Benefits will be paid to eligible displaced persons upon submission of required claim forms and documentation regarding the rental or purchase of decent, safe and sanitary replacement housing. Displacees are required to show documentation that they are a U. S. Citizen. Eligibility requirements and calculations will be detailed on an individual basis with all displacee households. In the course of personal interviews and follow-up visits, each displacee household will receive counseling regarding available benefit options and the requirements to claim compensation for moving payments and replacement housing assistance. TTD staff will promptly evaluate advance payment requests meant to alleviate hardships for tenants who do not have access to sufficient funds to pay move-in costs such as first month’s rent and/or security deposits. Approved requests for advance payments will be processed expeditiously to help avoid the loss of desirable, appropriate replacement housing. 1. Residential Moving Expense Payments All residential displacees will be eligible to receive a payment for moving expenses. Moving expense payments will be based either on the actual cost of a professional move or a fixed payment amount determined by room count.  Actual Cost (Professional Move) Displacees may elect to retain the service of a professional mover. The cost of professional moving services will be based on the lower of at least two acceptable bids obtained from licensed, professional movers. TTD may also obtain bids, at its own discretion, in order to determine the most qualified low-bidder for the move. TTD will make direct payment to the selected mover, if requested, or provide reimbursement upon presentation of appropriate documentation substantiating the move. Compensable moving elements include packing, transportation, un-packing and insurance. Transportation costs beyond 50 miles are not eligible, unless TTD determines that relocation beyond 50 miles is justified. In addition to payment for the actual move, one-time re-connection fees related to gas, water, electricity, telephone, internet and television service, are eligible for reimbursement. Deposits required by utility and other residential service providers are not eligible for reimbursement.  Fixed Payment (Room Count Schedule Method) As an alternative to a professional move, a residential displacee may elect to receive a fixed payment for moving expenses based on the number of furnished or unfurnished rooms in the displacement dwelling. TABLE 20: SCHEDULE OF FIXED MOVING PAYMENTS  Unfurnished Dwelling  Room Count  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  Each Additional Room  Amount  $685  $880  $1,100  $1,295  $1,570  $1,815  $2,090  $2,365  $250  Furnished Dwelling  Room Count  1  Each Additional Room  Amount  $450  $85  Residential displacees who elect to receive a fixed payment assume full responsibility for the move including vacating the premises in a timely manner and the expense of utility re-connections described in above. The current schedule for fixed moving payments is set forth in Table 20. 2. Rental Assistance to Tenants/Owner-Occupants Who Choose to Rent A tenant or owner-occupant displaced from a dwelling may be entitled to a Replacement Housing Payment in the form of rental or downpayment assistance not-to-exceed $5,250 (prior to consideration of eligibility for Last Resort Housing benefits -see Last Resort Housing this Section, Paragraph 6), if the displacee:  Has actually and lawfully occupied the displacement dwelling for at least 90 days immediately prior to the initiation of negotiations; and  Has rented, or purchased, and occupied a decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling within one year (unless TTD, at their sole discretion, extends this period for good cause) after: (i) For a tenant, the date he or she moves from the displacement dwelling; or (ii) For an owner-occupant, the later of:  The date final payment is received for the displacement dwelling, or in the case of condemnation, the date the full amount of estimated just compensation is deposited with the court; or  The date the displacee moves from the displacement dwelling. Rental/Downpayment Assistance payment amounts are equal to 42 times the difference between the base monthly rental and the lesser of: (i) The monthly rent and estimated average monthly cost of utilities for a comparable replacement dwelling; or (ii) The monthly rent and estimated average monthly cost of utilities for the decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling actually occupied by the displaced person; or (iii) The total of the amount designated for shelter and utilities if receiving a welfare assistance payment from a program that designated the amounts for shelter and utilities. The base monthly rental for the displacement dwelling is the lesser of: (i) The average monthly cost for rent and utilities at the displacement dwelling for a reasonable period prior to displacement, as determined by TTD. For owner-occupants or households which paid little or no rent, fair market rent will be used as a substitute for actual rent; or, (ii) Thirty percent (30%) of the displacee’s average gross household income. If a displacee refuses to provide appropriate evidence of income or is a dependent, the base monthly rental shall be determined to be the average monthly cost for rent and utilities at the displacement dwelling. Table 21, following, provides an example of a typical rental assistance eligibility computation. TABLE 21: COMPUTATION OF RENTAL ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS  1. Old Rent  $600  Old Rent (plus Utility Allowance)  -or  2. Ability to Pay  $550  30% of Monthly Gross Household Income*  3. Lesser of lines 1 and 2  $550  Subtracted from the lesser of:  4. Actual New Rent  $650  Actual New Rent (plus Utility Allowance)  -or  5. Comparable Rent  $675  Set by TTD (plus Utility Allowance)  6. Lesser of lines 4 and 5  $650  7. Monthly Need Amount  $100  Subtract line 3 from line 6  Rental Assistance  $4,200  Multiply line 7 (Monthly Need) by 42 months  *Monthly gross income is based on all income from all persons over 18 years old for the 12-month period preceding the date of determination of income. Do not include the income of a full-time student over the age of 18 UNLESS that person isthe head of the household or the person’s spouse. Gross household income means the total annual income of an individual 3. Downpayment Assistance to Tenants Who Choose to Purchase Residential displacees eligible to receive a rental assistance payment, may choose to utilize up to the full amount of their rental assistance eligibility (including any Last Resort benefits) to purchase a replacement dwelling, provided that the entire eligibility amount is used toward the downpayment and eligible incidental closing costs. In the case of Downpayment Assistance claims, TTD will arrange for the deposit of the total rental assistance eligibility amount in an open escrow account. Provisions will be included in the escrow instructions to assure the prompt return of all TTD-provided funds in the event escrow is cancelled by either party or should fail to close within a reasonable period of time. 4. Replacement Housing Payment to 180 Day Residential Owner-Occupants Residential owner-occupants who have established residency for at least 180 days prior to TTD’s offer to purchase may be eligible for a replacement housing payment determined by the aggregate value of three separate compensation elements: a) Purchase Price Differential; b) Mortgage Interest Differential; and, c) Incidental Expenses.  Purchase Price Differential The Purchase Price Differential is based on three factors: Acquisition Price -The final price paid by TTD for the Project dwelling; Actual Replacement Housing Purchase Price -The actual price paid for a replacement dwelling; and, Comparable Replacement Cost -The cost of a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling comparable to the dwelling acquired by TTD. The purchase price differential amount is determined by comparing the final acquisition price of the Project residence to the lesser of the actual price paid for a replacement home or the price of a comparable available decent, safe and sanitary dwelling. If the purchase price of a replacement home is less than the cost of a comparable replacement home, the payment will be limited to the actual difference. If the purchase price exceeds the cost of a comparable replacement home, the payment will be based on the cost of the comparable replacement home. Replacement housing referrals to owner-occupants will match, as closely as possible, current housing circumstances. The calculation of purchase price differential payments to owner-occupants of multifamily properties will be determined by comparing the pro-rated value of the portion of the property in which they live as compared to the comparable element of a replacement property.   Mortgage Interest Differential The Mortgage Interest Differential Payment is intended to compensate homeowners for any increase in interest costs between the acquired dwelling and the replacement dwelling. Computation of the payment is based upon three factors: 1) the remaining term and amount(s) of the current mortgage or mortgages 2) the current type of mortgage product (i.e. fixed vs. variable) 3) a comparison of the mortgage interest rate for the acquired dwelling relative to the lesser of the current market rate or the actual new rate for a similar mortgage product. To be eligible for this payment, the mortgage on the dwelling being acquired must have been in place, as a valid lien, for at least 180 days prior to the TTD’s initial written offer to purchase.  Incidental Expenses -Closing Costs One-time, non-recurring closing costs associated with the purchase of a comparable, replacement dwelling are compensable. Examples of such compensable expenses include costs for: a property survey; preparation of a legal description and deed; recording fees; title insurance; revenue stamps and transfer taxes; loan application fees; loan origination fees; appraisal fees; a credit report; certification for structural soundness; and, termite inspection, when required. Prepaid recurring expenses for mortgage interest, property taxes and insurance are not compensable. 5. Payments to Non-Tenured Residential Tenants Non low-income residential tenants with less than 90 days of continuous occupancy prior to the TTD’s acquisition of the property, will only be eligible to receive a moving expense payment in accordance with Section 1b above. 6. Last Resort Housing TTD anticipates that it will be necessary to make rental assistance payments in excess of the statutory cap of $5,250 and replacement housing payments to owner-occupants in excess of the statutory cap of $22,500 to assure the availability of comparable replacement rental and for-sale housing. Rental assistance payments to low-income non 90-day tenants and rental assistance and replacement housing payment amounts in excess of the statutory caps are considered to be Last Resort Housing (LRH) payments.  TTD, at its discretion, may opt to pay LRH rental assistance payments on a periodic basis. Recipients of LRH rental assistance who intend to purchase rather than re-rent replacement housing have the right to request a lump sum payment of all benefits for the purpose of making a downpayment and paying standard, nonrecurring closing costs. Households receiving periodic payments may elect, at any time, to request a lump sum payment of all remaining benefits to assist with the purchase of a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling. 7. Business Every effort will be made to comply with the sponsoring agency’s (TTD or project proponent) desire to relocate all business displacees to areas within the South Lake Tahoe City Limits. As with the Residential Relocation Assistance contained in this Relocation Study, the Relocation Assistance Agent will employ all additional aid required to assist impacted businesses with their relocation needs including assistance in planning the logistics and executing the move of personal property and non-realty business property. Unlike relocation of households from an existing single-family residence to another already constructed one selected from several available choices in this area, business relocations may require acquisition of un-improved sites and building of new improvements to meet the needs of the business.  The relocation agent will work closely with businesses to have claims filed promptly and with the requisite supporting documentation. The complexity of the moves and the need for specialists will add to the expense of an already costly assignment. Prompt claim processing and payment will reduce delays and minimize financial hardships to the business owners. Payments should be made directly to movers and other outside firms whenever possible to alleviate the additional financial burden of relocations to the businesses.  The complexity of the actual moves and the need for specialists and the involvement of specialized firms for planning and performing the moves. Actual moving costs will be calculated according to inventories and the efforts of removing, packing, loading, transporting, unloading, unpacking and reinstalling personal property. To the extent feasible, two bids will be obtained for each move.  Inventories for move cost estimates may require specialized firms  Specialized contractors for disconnecting and dismantling, packing, unpacking handling, and transportation.  Inspections may be required, along with permits and/or licenses, at the replacement properties. The City’s Planning Department and TRPA can assist with meeting the project timeline if these items could be expedited. This is another measure that can be taken to reduce downtime for the businesses as well as downtime during moves.  Additional downtime can be avoided or reduced with extra effort in planning the moves and prioritizing needed inspections and issuance of permits and licenses.  As part of the re-establishment costs, displacees may be reimbursed for the expense of making physical changes at the replacement location. The changes must be necessary to accommodate increased size or business needs. The relocation agent will work with tenants to properly document the changes required to make replacement sites suitable including obtaining descriptions, drawings and other details. (Re-establishment costs are capped at $10,000.00)  Displaced businesses and nonprofit organizations are entitled to reimbursement for actual, reasonable expenses incurred in searching for a replacement property, not to exceed $2,500.  Liberty Energy Customer Service will be contacted by the business owners regarding electric service and needs for 3-phase power. Liberty Energy will need details about existing accounts, current usage and the location of the replacement site to determine what measures to implement to provide the required service. Applications for service at the new addresses will be made directly to Liberty Energy. The cost of matching utilities with machinery and equipment is reimbursable to the business owner. Except in unusual circumstances, actual payment shall be limited to the least expensive alternative; that is, the cost to adapt the machinery and equipment to available utilities or to provide compatible utilities to the existing machinery and equipment.  There may not be any need for storage to facilitate moves for any displacees. However, if it becomes necessary to store any equipment and/or material in the course of relocating, prior authorization will be obtained from TTD. Displacees are entitled to reimbursement for the cost to move personally into and out of storage if storage is necessary. Storage of personal property for up to one-year during the move may be reimbursed.  Businesses will be given a Notification of Right to Claim Loss of Business Goodwill if it is determined the value of a relocated businesses could be adversely affected by moves. There may be increased operating expenses related to higher rents, increased utility costs or greater expenses of longer distances to other suppliers, customers or outside services which could be offset by presenting claims for Loss of Business Goodwill. If the business owners wish to present claims, they would complete the forms with supporting documentation, stating the Loss of Business Goodwill, for TTD review and approval. Claim processing would include verification of the amount of the Loss of Business Goodwill claimed by an appraiser with business valuation expertise.  Some displaced businesses may qualify for “In-Lieu” payments, which can range from $1,000 to $20,000, to cover all costs of relocating, leaving open the possibility of making claims for Loss of Business Goodwill. Goodwill amounts, if claimed, would be determined separately from the “In-Lieu” payment by a qualified appraiser so as to avoid duplication of payments and may be partially offset by “In-Lieu” payments.  Reestablishment payments, up to $10,000, may also be made to displaced businesses to cover expenses of certain repairs, redecoration or improvements to a replacement location, to advertise a new site, signage, increased costs at the new location and/or other items TTD may consider necessary for reestablishment of the business. C. GENERAL INFORMATION ON PAYMENT OF RELOCATION BENEFITS Claims and supporting documentation for relocation benefits must be filed with TTD within 18 months from:  The date the claimant moves from the acquired property; or,  The date, on which final payment for the acquisition of real property is made, whichever is later. The procedure for the preparation and filing of claims and the processing and delivery of payments will be as follows: 1) Claimant(s) will provide all necessary documentation to substantiate eligibility for assistance; 2)  Payment amounts will be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Federal relocation law and guidelines;  3)  Required claim forms will be prepared by relocation personnel and reviewed with claimants. Signed claims and supporting documentation will be submitted by relocation personnel to TTD;  4)  TTD will review all claims for payment and approve, deny, or seek additional information;  determine  whether  to  5)  TTD will issue benefit checks for distribution to claimants by relocation staff;  6)  Final payments will be issued only after confirmation that the Project premises have been completely vacated and occupancy of the replacement unit is verified;  7)  All correspondence, back-up documentation, claims, receipts of payment and notices will be maintained in the relocation case file.  V. ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS A. RELOCATION TAX CONSEQUENCES In general, relocation payments are not considered income for the purpose of the Internal Revenue Code of 1968, or the Personal Income Tax Law, Part 10 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. The above statement on tax consequences is not intended to be provision of tax advice by TTD. Displacees are responsible for consulting with their own tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of relocation payments. B. APPEALS PROCEDURES TTD will adopt a Relocation Appeals Process which is consistent with the Provisions of 49 CFR 24.10 (b). The right to appeal shall be described in all relocation explanatory material distributed to displacees. As required under the Federal relocation guidelines, any aggrieved person may file a written appeal with TTD in any case in which the person believes that the TTD or project proponent has failed to properly consider the person’s application for relocation assistance. Such assistance may include, but is not limited to, the person’s eligibility for, or the amount of, a relocation payment required under the Uniform Act. Requests for administrative review and informal hearings will be directed to senior relocation staff of TTD. All requests for review will receive written responses from TTD within three weeks of their receipt. If an informal appeal is denied, appellants will be entitled to file a written request for a formal hearing before an impartial and independent hearing officer. More detail concerning the appeals process will be provided upon request. Appellants will retain their appeal rights for up to 18 months following the date of displacement from the Project area premises or receipt of final payment for relocation benefits, whichever is later. C. EVICTION POLICY Eviction for cause must conform to State and local law. Any person who occupies the real property and is not an unlawful occupant on the date of initiation of negotiations, is presumed to be entitled to relocation benefits, unless the displacing agency determines that:  The person received an eviction notice prior to the initiation of negotiations and, as a result, was later evicted; or  The person is evicted after the initiation of negotiations for serious or repeated violation of material terms of the lease; and  The eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading relocation assistance regulations. Except for the causes of eviction set forth above, no person lawfully occupying property to be purchased by the displacing agency will be required to move without having been provided with at least 90 days written notice from the displacing agency. D. CITIZEN PARTICIPATION As the process for considering the Project moves forward, TTD will observe the following protocol:  Provide affected displacees with full and timely access to documents relevant to the relocation program;  Provide technical assistance necessary to interpret elements of the Relocation Study and other pertinent materials;  Issuance of a general notice concerning the availability of the Study for public review, as required, 30 days prior to its proposed adoption. Distribution of the Study, upon request, to all affected and interested parties;  The inclusion of written or oral comments concerning the Study and TTD’s response as an attachment to the Study when it is forwarded to the TTD Board for adoption (as Exhibit D). E. PROJECTED DATES OF DISPLACEMENT Should the Project be approved, TTD anticipates that the relocation process will begin in Spring 2015 and be completed no later than Fall 2016. F. ESTIMATED RELOCATION COSTS The total estimated budget for relocation-related payments (residential and business) for this Project is unknown at this time, but is it anticipated to be in the range of $1,500,000 to $2,000,000 for the alternatives. Following project approval, the TTD will work to identify all costs and develop a more accurate estimate. The estimated relocation budget are solely associated with relocation cost and assistance and does not include any payments related to property acquisition or improvements pertaining to realty. In addition, the budget does not consider the cost of any services necessary to implement the findings of the Study and complete the relocation element of the Project. EXHIBITS EXHIBIT B: Income Limits – El Dorado County The following figures are approved by the U.

This law, called the Uniform Act, is the foundation for the information discussed in this brochure. Acquisition and relocation policies and provisions for all Federal and federally assisted programs and projects are contained in the government-wide rule published in the Federal Register on January 4, 2005. The rules are reprinted each year in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 49, Part 24. All Federal, State, local government agencies, and others receiving Federal financial assistance for public programs and projects that require the acquisition of real property must comply with the policies and provisions set forth in the Uniform Act and the regulation. The acquisition itself does not need to be federally funded for the rules to apply. If Federal funds are used in any phase of the program or project, the rules of the Uniform Act apply. Section 1 of this brochure provides information about relocation assistance advisory service. Section 2 contains information important to you if you are being displaced from a residence. Section 3 contains information for displaced businesses, farms, and nonprofit t organizations. If you are required to move as a result of a Federal or federally assisted program or project, a relocation counselor will contact you. The counselor will answer your specific questions and provide additional information you may need. If you have a disability that prevents you from reading or understanding this brochure, you will be provided appropriate assistance. You should notify the sponsoring Agency if you have special requirements for assistance. This brochure explains your rights as an owner of real property to be acquired for a federally funded program or project. The requirements for acquisition of property are explained in a brochure entitled Acquisition, Acquiring Real Property for Federal and Federal-aid Programs and Projects. Acquisition and relocation information can be found on the Federal Highway Administration Office of Real Estate Services website www.fhwa.dot.gov/realestate. IMPORTANT TERMS USED IN THIS BROCHURE Agency Relocation assistance advisory services and payments are administered at the local level by an Agency responsible for the acquisition of real property and/or the displacement of people from property to be used for a federally funded program or project. The Agency may be a Federal agency, a State agency, a local agency, such as a county or a city, or a person carrying out a program or project with Federal financial assistance. The Agency may contract with a qualified individual or firm to administer the relocation program. However, the Agency remains responsible for the program. Alien Not Lawfully Present The law provides that if a displaced person is an alien not lawfully present in the United States such person is not eligible for relocation payments or assistance under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act, unless ineligibility would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien’s spouse, parent or child, and such spouse, parent or child is a citizen or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Business Any lawful activity, with the exception of a farm operation, conducted primarily for the purchase, sale, lease and rental of personal or real property, or for the manufacture, processing, and/or marketing of products, commodities, or any other personal property, or for the sale of services to the public, or solely for the purpose of this Act, and outdoor advertising display or displays, when the display(s) must be moved as a result of the project. Displaced Person Any person (individual, family, partnership, association or corporation) who moves from real property, or moves personal property from real property as a direct result of (1) the acquisition of the real property, in whole or in part, (2) a written notice from the Agency of its intent to acquire, (3) the initiation of negotiations for the purchase of the real property by the Agency, or (4) a written notice requiring a person to vacate real property for the purpose of rehabilitation or demolition of improvements, provided the displacement is permanent and the property is needed for a Federal or federally assisted program or project. Farm Any activity conducted solely or primarily for the production of one or more agricultural products or commodities, including timber, for sale and home use, and customarily producing such products or commodities in sufficient quantity to be capable of contributing materially to the operator’s support. Nonprofit Organization A public or private entity that has established its nonprofit status under Federal or State law. Program or Project An activity or series of activities undertaken by a Federal agency, or an activity undertaken by a State or local agency with Federal financial assistance in any phase of the activity. Small Business A business having not more than 500 employees working at a site which is the location of economic activity and which will be acquired for a program or project, or is displaced by a program or project. A site occupied solely by an outdoor advertising sign(s) does not qualify for purposes of the reestablishment expense benefit. SECTION 1 – RELOCATION ADVISORY SERVICES A relocation counselor will contact you and offer relocation assistance service. Any individual, family, business or farm displaced by a Federal or federally assisted program shall be offered relocation assistance services for the purpose of locating a suitable replacement property. Relocation services are provided by qualified personnel employed by the Agency. It is their goal and desire to be of service to you, and assist in any way possible to help you successfully relocate. Remember, your relocation counselor is there to help and advise you, so please be sure to make full use of the counselor’s services. Do not hesitate to ask questions and be sure you fully understand all your rights and benefits. An individual with a disability will be provided the assistance needed to locate and move to a replacement dwelling or site. The individual should notify the Agency of any special requirements for assistance. RESIDENTIAL ASSISTANCE A relocation counselor from the Agency will contact and interview you to find out your needs. Relocation services and payments will be explained in accordance with your eligibility. During the initial interview your housing needs and desires will be determined as well as your need for assistance. The counselor will offer assistance and provide a current listing of comparable properties. You will be provided a written determination of the amount of replacement housing payment for which you qualify. The counselor can supply information on other Federal and State programs in your area. Transportation will be offered to inspect housing referrals. The Agency will provide counseling or help you get assistance from other sources as a means of minimizing hardships in adjusting to your new location. You cannot be required to move unless at least one comparable decent, safe, and sanitary (DSS) replacement dwelling is made available to you. Please let your counselor know if you locate a replacement dwelling so that it can be inspected to assure that it meets DSS standards. BUSINESS, FARM, AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION ASSISTANCE A relocation counselor from the Agency will contact and interview you to find out your needs and replacement site requirements and estimate the time needed to accomplish the move. Relocation services and payments will be explained in accordance with your eligibility. It is important to explain to the counselor any anticipated problems. During the initial interview the relocation counselor will ask many questions to determine your financial ability to accomplish the move, including lease terms and other obligations. The counselor will help determine the need for outside specialists to plan, move, and reinstall personal property. The counselor will identify and resolve any issues regarding what is real estate and what is personal property to be relocated. The counselor will explore and provide advice as to possible sources of funding and assistance from other local, State, and Federal agencies. In addition, as needed, the relocation counselor will maintain listings of commercial properties and farms. The goal is to achieve a successful relocation back into the community. Social Services Provided By Other Agencies Your relocation counselor will be familiar with the services provided by other public and private agencies in your community. If you have special problems, the counselor will make every effort to secure the services of those agencies with trained personnel who have the expertise to help you. Make your needs known in order that you may receive the help you need. SECTION 2 – INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES MOVING COSTS If you qualify as a displaced person, you are entitled to reimbursement of your moving costs and certain related moving expenses. Displaced individuals and families may choose to be paid either on the basis of actual, reasonable moving costs and related expenses, or according to a fixed moving cost schedule. To assure your eligibility and prompt payment of moving expenses, you should contact the relocation counselor from the Agency before you move. Actual, Reasonable Moving Costs You may be paid for your actual, reasonable moving costs by a professional mover plus related expenses, or you may move yourself. Reimbursement will be limited to a 50-mile distance in most cases. Related expenses involved in the move may include: • Packing and unpacking personal property. • Disconnecting and reconnecting household appliances. • Temporary storage of personal property. • Insurance while property is in storage or transit. • Transfer of telephone service and other similar utility reconnections. • Other expenses considered eligible by the Agency. • All expenses must be considered necessary and reasonable by the Agency and supported by paid receipts or other evidence of expenses incurred. Fixed Moving Cost Schedule You may choose to be paid on the basis of a fixed moving cost schedule established for your State of residence. The amount of the payment is based on the number of rooms in your dwelling. Your relocation counselor will be able to tell you the exact amount you will be eligible to receive if you select this option. The schedule is designed to include all of the expenses incurred in moving, including those services that must be purchased from others. If you are the owner of a displaced mobile home, you may be entitled to a payment for the cost of moving the mobile home to a replacement site on an actual cost basis. Displaced mobile home occupants (owners or tenants) may also be eligible for a payment for moving personal property from the mobile home such as furniture, appliances and clothing on an actual cost basis, or on the basis of a moving cost schedule. For a complete explanation of all moving cost options involving a mobile home, please discuss the matter with your relocation counselor. REPLACEMENT HOUSING There are three types of replacement housing payments: purchase supplement, rental assistance, and down payment. To understand replacement housing payments you first need to become familiar with the terms Comparable; Financial Means; Decent, Safe, and Sanitary (DSS); and Last Resort Housing. Comparable A comparable replacement dwelling must be DSS and functionally equivalent to your present dwelling. While not necessarily identical to your present dwelling, a comparable replacement dwelling should provide for the same utility and function as the dwelling from which you are being displaced. In addition, a comparable replacement dwelling should be: • Adequate in size to accommodate the occupants (e.g., you and your family). • Located in an area that is not subject to unreasonable adverse environmental conditions. • Located in an area that is not less desirable than your present location with respect to public utilities and commercial and public facilities. • Reasonably accessible to your place of employment. • Located on a site that is typical in size for residential development with normal site improvements. • Currently available on the private market. • Within your financial means. Financial Means For a homeowner, if a purchase supplement is needed and provided, in addition to the acquisition price for your dwelling, then the replacement dwelling is considered to be within your financial means. For a tenant, the monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility (electricity, gas, other heating and cooking fuels, water and sewer) cost for a comparable replacement dwelling is considered to be within financial means if, after receiving rental assistance, this amount does not exceed the base monthly rent (including average monthly utility cost) for the dwelling from which the tenant is displaced. The Agency may need to calculate the base monthly rent using 30% of the displaced tenant’s total monthly gross household income, if that income qualifies as low income in accordance with established low income amounts determined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The Agency will also evaluate the amounts designated for shelter and utilities for a tenant that receives government assistance. The rental assistance payment will be computed using the lesser of the three (rent and average monthly utility cost; 30% of the total monthly gross household income for a qualified low income tenant; or the total amount designated for shelter and utilities for a tenant receiving government assistance). To ensure the maximum benefit, it is important to provide the Agency appropriate evidence of total monthly household income when asked. There are some amounts that are not included as monthly household income, including income earned by dependents. The Agency will explain this procedure in greater detail. Decent, Safe, and Sanitary The DSS standard means the replacement dwelling meets the minimum requirements established by Federal regulations and conforms to applicable local housing and occupancy codes. The dwelling shall: • Be structurally sound, weather tight, and in good repair. • Contain a safe electrical wiring system adequate for lighting and other devices. • Contain a heating system capable of sustaining a healthful temperature (approximately 70 degrees Fahrenheit) except in those areas where local climatic conditions do not require such a system. • Be adequate in size with respect to the number of rooms and area of living space to accommodate the displaced person. • Contain a well-lighted and ventilated bathroom providing privacy to the user and containing a sink, bathtub or shower stall, and a toilet, all in good working order and properly connected to appropriate sources of water and sewage drainage system. • Contain a kitchen area with a fully usable sink, properly connected to potable hot and cold water and to a sewage drainage system, with adequate space and utility connections for a stove and refrigerator. • Have unobstructed egress to safe, open space at ground level. • Be free of any barriers which prevent reasonable ingress, egress or, in the case of a handicapped displaced person, use of the dwelling. IMPORTANT NOTICE Please understand that the replacement dwelling inspection for decent, safe, and sanitary requirements is conducted by Agency personnel for the sole purpose of determining your eligibility for a relocation payment. Therefore, you must not interpret the Agency’s approval of a dwelling to provide any assurance or guarantee that there are no deficiencies in the dwelling or in its fixtures and equipment that may be discovered at a later date. It is your responsibility to protect your best interest and investment in the purchase or rental of your replacement property and you must clearly understand that the Agency will assume no responsibility if structural, mechanical, legal, or other unforeseen problems are discovered after the inspection has been conducted. Last Resort Housing The term Last Resort Housing is an administrative procedure authorized by law to address those times when comparable replacement housing is not available under statutory limits specified in law. The law and regulation allow the Agency to provide a replacement housing payment in excess of the statutory maximums of $5,250 and $22,500. Because this provision is commonly used, the statutory maximums will not be restated throughout this brochure. The Agency must provide comparable replacement housing, that is DSS and within your financial means, before you are required to move. The Agency may provide the necessary housing in a number of ways, such as: • Making a replacement housing payment in excess of the maximum $5,250 or $22,500 statutory limits. • Purchasing an existing comparable residential dwelling and making it available to you in exchange for your dwelling. • Moving and rehabilitating a dwelling and making it available to you in exchange for your property. • Purchasing, rehabilitating or reconstructing an existing dwelling to make it comparable to your property. • Purchasing land and constructing a new replacement dwelling comparable to your dwelling when comparables are not otherwise available. • Purchasing an existing dwelling, removing barriers or rehabilitating the structure to accommodate a handicapped displaced person when a suitable comparable replacement dwelling is not available. • Providing a direct loan which will enable you to construct or contract for the construction of a decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling. Freedom of Choice All eligible displaced persons have the freedom of choice in the selection of a replacement dwelling. The Agency will not require you, without your written consent, to accept a replacement dwelling provided by the Agency. If you decide not to accept the replacement housing offered by the Agency, you may secure a replacement dwelling of your choice but it must meet the DSS standard. If you are eligible for Last Resort Housing, your relocation counselor will thoroughly explain the program to you. Length of Occupancy – Basic Occupancy Requirements The type of payment you are eligible for depends on whether you are an owner or a tenant, and how long you have lived in the property being acquired prior to the initiation of negotiations. “Length of occupancy” simply means counting the number of days that you occupied the dwelling before the date of initiation of negotiations by the Agency for the purchase of the property. The term “initiation of negotiations” is usually the date the Agency makes the first personal contact with the owner of real property, or his/her representative, to provide a written offer to purchase the property being acquired. Owners who were in occupancy 180 days or more prior to the initiation of negotiations may be eligible for a purchase supplement or a rental assistance payment. Tenants who were in occupancy 90 days or more prior to the initiation of negotiations may be eligible for a rental assistance payment or a down payment. Owners who were in occupancy 90 days to 179 days prior to the initiation of negotiations, may be eligible for a rental assistance payment or a down payment, however, the down payment cannot exceed the amount you would have received if you had been a 180-day owner. If you were in occupancy at the time of the initiation of negotiations, but less than 90 days prior to that date, you are considered a displaced person entitled to relocation assistance advisory services and moving payments. You may be entitled to a rental assistance payment if comparable replacement rental housing is not available within your financial means. The Agency will use the financial means test described earlier in this brochure. This involves checking to see if you qualify as low income using the HUD definition. If so, and you are required to pay rent and utilities in excess of 30% of your average monthly gross household income for a comparable replacement dwelling unit, you may be eligible for a rental assistance payment under Last Resort Housing because comparable replacement housing is not available within your financial means. You should meet with your relocation counselor for an explanation of the relocation benefits that you may be eligible to receive. REPLACEMENT HOUSING – PURCHASE SUPPLEMENT For Owner Occupants of 180 Days or More If you are an owner and occupied your home for 180 days or more immediately prior to the initiation of negotiations for your property, you may be eligible -in addition to the fair market value of your property -for a supplemental payment for costs necessary to purchase a comparable DSS replacement dwelling. The Agency will compute the maximum payment you are eligible to receive. You must purchase and occupy a DSS replacement dwelling within one year. A purchase supplement has three components: a price differential, an amount for increased mortgage interest and incidental expenses. The purchase supplement is in addition to the acquisition price paid for your property. Price Differential The price differential payment is the amount by which the cost of a replacement dwelling exceeds the acquisition cost of the displacement dwelling. Increased Mortgage Interest You may be reimbursed for increased mortgage interest costs if the interest rate on your new mortgage exceeds that of your present mortgage. To be eligible your acquired dwelling must have been encumbered by a bona fide mortgage which was a valid lien for at least 180 days prior to the initiation of negotiations. Incidental Expenses You may be reimbursed for other expenses such as reasonable costs incurred for title search, recording fees, and certain other closing costs, but not for prepaid expenses such as real estate taxes and property insurance. Example of a Price Differential Computation Example A: Assume the Agency purchases your property for $100,000. After a thorough study of available comparable residential properties on the open market, the Agency determines that a comparable replacement property will cost $116,500. If you purchase a DSS replacement property for $116,500, you will be eligible for a price differential payment of $16,500. Example B: If you purchase a DSS replacement property costing more than $116,500, you pay the difference as shown in Example B. Example C: If your purchase price is less than $116,500, the price differential payment will be based on your actual cost. Agency Computation of Maximum Price Differential Payment  Cost of Comparable Replacement Acquisition Price of Your Property Maximum Price Differential Payment  $116,500 -$100,000 $ 16,500  Example A  Actual Cost of Replacement Property (Same Purchase Price as Comparable) Acquisition Price of Your Property Price Differential Payment  $116,500 -$100,000 $ 16,500  Example B  Actual Cost of Replacement Property Acquisition Price of Your Property Difference Price Differential Payment You Are Responsible for This Amount  $125,000 -$100,000 $ 25,000 $ 16,500 $ 8,500  Example C  Actual Cost of Replacement Property Acquisition Price of Your Pro Price Differential Payment Payment is Based on Actual Cost  $114,000 -100,000 $ 14,000  REPLACEMENT HOUSING – RENTAL ASSISTANCE 180-Day Owners Who Elect to Rent A rental computation will be computed based on a determination of the fair market rent for the acquired dwelling compared to a comparable rental dwelling available on the market. The difference will be multiplied by 42. In no circumstances will the rental assistance payment exceed the amount the owner would have received as a price differential described previously. For Owner Occupants and Tenants of 90 Days or More Owner occupants and tenants of 90 days or more may be eligible for a rental assistance payment. To be eligible for a rental assistance payment, tenants and owners must have been in occupancy at least 90 days immediately preceding the initiation of negotiations for the acquisition of the property. This payment is designed to enable you to rent a comparable decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling for a 42-month period. If you choose to rent a replacement dwelling and the cost of rent and utilities are higher than you were paying, you may be eligible for a rental assistance payment. The Agency will determine the maximum payment you may be eligible to receive in accordance with established procedures. The rental assistance payment will be paid in a lump sum unless the Agency determines that the payment should be paid in installments. You must rent and occupy a DSS replacement dwelling within one year to be eligible. Example Assume you have been paying $500 per month rent for the dwelling unit occupied by you and purchased by the Agency. You also pay $150 per month for utilities (electricity, gas, other heating and cooking fuels, water, and sewer). The rental assistance payment computation always includes the cost of basic utilities (electricity, gas, other heating and cooking fuels, water, and sewer), as well as the cost of rent. If rent includes utilities, a separate computation is not necessary. After a study of the rental market, the Agency determines that replacement rental unit, that is DSS and comparable to your unit, is available for $600 per month. It is estimated that average monthly utility costs for the replacement unit will be $175 per month. The maximum rental assistance payment you can receive is $125 per month for a 42-month period, or a total of $5,250. Example A: If you select a DSS replacement dwelling unit that rents for $650 per month plus $175 for utilities, despite the availability of comparable DSS replacement rental units that rent for $600 per month plus $175 for utilities, you will receive the maximum amount computed by the Agency, or $5,250. You will be required to pay the additional $50 per month yourself. On the basis of actual cost, you will be eligible for a payment of $90 per month for 42 months, or $3,780. Agency Computation  Rent You are Currently Paying  $500  of Maximum Rental  Plus Cost for Utilities You are Paying  +150  Assistance Payment  $650  Rent for a Comparable DSS Dwelling  $600  Estimated Cost for Utilities  +175  $775  Difference ($775-650=$125) x 42 months  $5,250  Maximum Rental Assistance Payment  $5,250  Example A  Actual Rent for DSS Replacement Property Plus  $650  Estimated Cost for Utilities  +175  $825  Difference ($825-650=$175) x 42 months  $7,350  Rental Assistance Payment  $5,250  Example B  Actual Rent for DSS Replacement Property  $575  Plus Estimated Cost for Utilities  +165  $740  Difference ($740-650=$90) x 42 months  $3,780  Rental Assistance Payment  $3,780  REPLACEMENT HOUSING – DOWN PAYMENT Owner Occupants of 90 to 179 Days and Tenants of 90 Days or More Owner occupants of 90 to 179 days and tenants of 90 days or more may be eligible for a down payment and incidental expenses. The Agency will determine the maximum down payment you may be eligible to receive based on its computation for a rental assistance payment. However, the payment for a displaced owner occupant shall not exceed the amount that would have been received by a 180-day owner for the same property. To be eligible for the full amount of the down payment assistance payment, the entire payment must be used to purchase a DSS replacement dwelling. The payment may be utilized for a down payment toward the purchase price and/or eligible incidental expenses. Incidental expenses include the reasonable costs of title search, recording fees, and certain other closing costs but do not include prepaid expenses such as real estate taxes and property insurance. You may be eligible for the reimbursement of loan origination or loan assumption fees if such fees are normal to real estate transactions in your area and do not represent prepaid interest. The combined amount of the down payment and incidental expenses cannot exceed the amount the Agency computed as your maximum rental assistance payment. The relocation counselor will explain how the Agency determines the maximum down payment assistance payment. DSS REMINDER It is very important to remember that the replacement dwelling you select must meet the basic DSS standard. Do not execute a sales contract or a lease agreement until a representative from the Agency has inspected and certified in writing that the dwelling you propose to purchase or rent meets the DSS standard. Please do not jeopardize your right to receive a replacement housing payment by moving into a substandard dwelling. FAIR HOUSING LAWS Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 set forth the policy of the United States to provide, within constitutional limitations, for fair housing throughout the United States. These Acts and Executive Order 11063 make discriminatory practices in the purchase and rental of residential units illegal if based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Whenever possible, a minority person shall be given reasonable opportunity to relocate to a DSS replacement dwelling which is not located in an area of minority concentration that is within their financial means. This policy does not require an Agency to provide a displaced person with a larger payment than is necessary to enable the person to relocate to a comparable replacement dwelling. SECTION 3 – BUSINESS, FARM, AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS MOVING COST REIMBURSEMENT Owners or tenants may be paid on the basis of actual, reasonable moving costs and related expenses or, under certain circumstances, a fixed payment. Actual, reasonable moving expenses may be paid when the move is performed by a professional mover or if you move yourself. Related expenses, such as personal property losses, expenses in finding a replacement site, and reestablishment expenses may also be reimbursable. You must provide the Agency with an inventory of the personal property to be moved and advance notice of the approximate date of the move, unless the Agency specifically tells you these notices are not necessary. The Agency has the right to inspect the personal property at the displacement and replacement sites, and to monitor the move. Actual Cost Move You may be paid the actual, reasonable and necessary cost of your move when the move is performed by a professional mover or when you elect to move yourself, however, all your moving costs must be supported by paid receipts or other evidence of expenses incurred. In addition to the transportation costs of your personal property, certain other expenses may be reimbursable, such as packing, crating, unpacking and uncrating, and the disconnecting, dismantling, removing, reassembling, and reinstalling relocated machinery, equipment and other personal property. Other expenses such as professional services necessary for planning and carrying out the move, temporary storage costs, and the cost of licenses, permits and certifications may also be reimbursable. This is not an inclusive list of moving related expenses. Your relocation counselor will provide you with a complete explanation of reimbursable expenses. Estimated Cost Move If you agree to take full responsibility for all or part of the move of your operation, the Agency may approve a payment not to exceed the lower of two acceptable bids or estimates obtained by the Agency from qualified moving firms, moving consultants, or a qualified Agency staff employee. A low cost or uncomplicated move may be based on a single bid or estimate at the Agency’s discretion. The advantage of this moving option is that it relieves you from documenting all moving expenses because the payment is limited to the amount of the lowest acceptable bid or estimate. The Agency may make the payment without additional documentation. Direct Loss of Tangible Personal Property Displaced businesses, farms, and nonprofit organizations may be eligible for a payment for the actual direct loss of tangible personal property which is incurred as a result of the move or discontinuance of the operation. This payment is based on the lesser of the value of the item for continued use at the displacement site less the proceeds from its sale, or the estimated cost of moving the item. Your relocation counselor will explain this procedure in detail if this is a consideration for you. Low Value High Bulk Property If an Agency considers a personal property item to be of low value and high bulk, and moving costs are disproportionate to its value (such as minerals, metals, rock, or topsoil), the allowable moving cost payment shall not exceed the lesser of the amount which would be received if the property were sold at the site, or, the replacement cost of a comparable quantity delivered to the new business location. Searching Expenses for Replacement Property Displaced businesses, farms, and nonprofit organizations are entitled to reimbursement for actual, reasonable expenses incurred in searching for a replacement property, not to exceed $2,500. Expenses may include transportation, meals, and lodging when away from home; the reasonable value of the time spent during the search; and other expenses determined to be reasonable and necessary by the Agency. Fees paid to real estate agents or brokers to locate a replacement site may be reimbursed, exclusive of any commissions or fees related to the purchase of the site. Commissions and fees related to the purchase of a replacement site are not eligible relocation expenses and will not be reimbursed. RELATED ELIGIBLE EXPENSES In addition to the moving expenses listed above, costs for these items may be reimbursed if the Agency determines they are actual, reasonable, and necessary: • Connection to available nearby utilities from the right-of-way to improvements at the replacement site. • Professional services to determine a sites’ suitability for the displaced person’s operation. • Impact fees or one time assessments for heavy utility usage as determined necessary by the Agency. Please discuss this with your relocation counselor before incurring these costs to assure that they are reimbursable. REESTABLISHMENT EXPENSES A small business, farm, or nonprofit organization may be eligible for a payment, not to exceed Ten Thousand ($10,000), for expenses actually incurred in relocating and reestablishing the enterprise at a replacement site. To qualify, the business, farm, or nonprofit organization must have not more than 500 employees working at the site who will be displaced by a program or project. Reestablishment expenses may include, but are not limited to: • Repairs or improvements to the replacement real property required by Federal, State, and local laws, codes or ordinances. • Modifications to the replacement real property to make the structure(s) suitable for the operation. • Construction and installation costs of exterior advertising signs. • Redecoration or replacement such as painting, wallpapering, paneling, and carpeting when required by the condition of the replacement site. • Advertising the replacement location. • Estimated increased costs of operation at the replacement site during the first two years for items such as: lease or rental charges; personal or real property taxes; insurance premiums; utility charges (excluding impact fees). • Other items that the Agency considers essential for reestablishment. • FIXED PAYMENT FOR ACTUAL MOVING EXPENSES (IN LIEU PAYMENT) Displaced businesses, farms, and nonprofit organizations may be eligible for a fixed payment in lieu of (in place of) actual moving expenses, personal property losses, searching expense, and reestablishment expenses. The fixed payment may not be less than One Thousand ($1,000) nor more than Twenty Thousand ($20,000). For a business to be eligible for a fixed payment, the Agency must determine the following: • Business owns or rents personal property that must be moved due to the displacement. • Business cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of its existing patronage. • Business is not part of a commercial enterprise having more than three other businesses engaged in the same or similar activity which are under the same ownership and are not being displaced by the Agency. • Business contributed materially to the income of the displaced business operator during the two taxable years prior to displacement. Any business operation that is engaged solely in the rental of space to others is not eligible for a fixed payment. This includes the rental of space for residential or business purposes Eligibility requirements for farms and nonprofit organizations are slightly different than business requirements. The computation for nonprofit organizations differs in that the payment is computed on the basis of average annual gross revenues less administrative expenses for the two year period specified. If you are interested in a fixed payment, please consult your relocation counselor for additional information. Computation of Your Fixed Payment The fixed payment for a displaced business or farm is based upon the average annual net earnings of the operation for the two taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in which it was displaced, or a two-year period deemed more representative by the Agency. You must provide the Agency with proof of net earnings to support your claim. Proof of net earnings can be documented by income tax returns, certified financial statements, or other reasonable evidence acceptable to the Agency. Fixed Payment Example 2003 2004 2005 Annual Net Earnings Annual Net Earnings Year Displaced $16,500 $18,500 Average annual net earnings $16,500 + $18,500 = $35,000 / 2 = $17,500 Fixed Payment = $17,500 PROJECT OFFICE The Agency may establish a relocation office near the project. Project relocation offices are usually open during hours convenient to persons being displaced, including evening hours when necessary. If the Agency opens a project office, the staff will be happy to assist you, answer questions, and will maintain various types of information. RELOCATION PAYMENTS ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE INCOME No relocation payment received will be considered as income for the purpose of the Internal Revenue Code. No relocation payment received will be considered income for the purposes of determining eligibility or the extent of eligibility of any person for assistance under the Social Security Act or any other Federal law (except for any Federal law providing low-income housing assistance). RIGHT TO APPEAL Any aggrieved person may file a written appeal with the head of the Agency if the person believes the Agency has failed to properly determine his or her eligibility for relocation assistance advisory services, or the amount of a relocation payment. If you have a grievance, you will be given a prompt and full opportunity to be heard. You will also have the right to be represented by legal counsel or other representative in connection with the appeal, but solely at your own expense. The Agency will promptly review your appeal and consider all pertinent justification and information available to ensure a fair and full review. The Agency will provide you with a written determination as well as an explanation of the decision. If you are still dissatisfied with the relief granted, the Agency will advise you of your right to seek judicial review of the Agency decision. An alien not lawfully present in the United States shall not be eligible to receive relocation payments or any other assistance provided under 49 CFR Part 24. This brochure is provided to assist you in understanding your rights and benefits. If you have questions regarding your relocation please contact your sponsoring Agency representative. Additional information on Federal relocation and acquisition requirements, the law, and the regulation can be found at www.fhwa.dot.gov/realestate . NOTES: EXHIBIT D: Public Comments and Response Appendix H Title VI Policy Statement STATE OF CALIFORNI A-8USINESS TRANSPORTATION AND 1·10\ISINQ AGENCY EDMUND G OR OWN Jr Gowmor DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR P.O.

However, typically, with mixed‐use projects as one component is built, the exterior painting is also completed. Thus, it more likely that architectural coatings would occur during the projects' building phase, as buildings are completed. To adjust for this, it was assumed that architecural coatings would begin after 2/3 of the total building phase is complete through the duration of the building/paving phase, with some still ocurring once all construction is done (i.e., default CalEEMod Arch. * Coating Phase lenght) . Thus, for Site 1, 90 day phase Site 2 95 day phase, and Site 3 89 days of architectural coatings was assumed. Paving ROG NOX PM10 PM2.5 CO On Site 1.66 16.7 1 0.95 12.2 Off Site 0.1 0.06 0.12 0.03 0.77 Pav Total 0.1 0.06 0.12 0.03 0.77 Architectural Coating  ROG  NOX  PM10  PM2.5  CO  On Site  225.4  2.19  0.17  0.17  1.87  Adj.

The methodology used to estimate fugitive dust emissions   is a simplified methodology involving estimates of the maximum area (acreage) of land disturbed daily.  Detailed fugitive dust emission estimates   associated with individual materials handling operations and/or activity/vehicle types cannot be conducted with this version of the model.  The Emission Estimates worksheet cannot be modified directly, it is a protected worksheet.  It can only be modified indirectly by   entering information for the project in selected areas of the Data Entry worksheet.   The last seven of these worksheets - EMFAC2014, On-road Mitigation EF, OFFROAD Convert, Off-road Tier 4 EF, OFFROAD HP & LP, OFFROAD EF and x-ref -  cannot be modified by the user.        They are protected worksheets.   Even though all or portions of several worksheets are protected, the individual formulas used in the calculations can be seen by the user.  The Data Entry worksheet includes several areas that can be modified by the user.   User instructions in the Data Entry worksheet are highlighted in red.   On the Data Entry worksheet, the user has two options for entering project data: required data and optional data.  Required data is entered in the data input    section (yellow cells).  That required data is then used by the worksheet to calculate default values for the project.   The user can override the default values (blue cells) calculated for a project and is encouraged to do so if project specific information is   available. Due to the difficulty in developing reliable default values for road construction projects,   the user is encouraged to enter as much site specific information as is available for the project being analyzed.   The Data Entry Worksheet also includes a button that allows the user to clear previously entered data.  This button is found just at the top of and to the right of      the data entry portion of the worksheet.  When projects are discontinuous, the user must make adjustments to the spreadsheet manually, since the program cannot be setup to anticipate unexpected project delays. #VALUE! <- This error message may occur during use of the spreadsheets.  This occurs whenever the user    enters a non numeric value, including a space character, into a cell that is used to calculate a numeric value.   Consequently, to erase values entered into the spreadsheets, use the delete key instead of the space bar! Note: Information in this worksheet is based on conversations with knowledgeable individuals at the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District, the California Department of Transportation, the California Air Resources Board, the U.S. EPA,  and private industry involved in road construction. Also, the 26th edition of Walker's Building Estimator's Reference Book (1999) was used in the development of this spreadsheet.

Note that there are no default vehicle or equipment activities available for the Project Type 4. 3) Emissions estimates were extended to include SOx, CH4, N2O and CO2e. 4)Updated off-road equipment emission factors and default average horsepower by equipment type to be consistent with CalEEMod (version 2013.2.2). 5) On-road vehicle emission factors have been updated to EMFAC2014. 6) Revised pollutant order for consistency throughout the calculator. 7) Added flexibility for users to specify a non-default number of working days per month. 8)Modified soil hauling import and export quantity and haul truck capacity data requests to allow users to specify soil hauling activity by phase. 9) Soil hauling emissions are now estimated separately for each construction phase. 10) Added a new feature to allow users to provide asphalt hauling quantities by phase in the "Data Entry" tab. 11) New component added where the user can specify construction start date and duration by phase. 12) The maximum daily emissions calculation was modified to sum emissions from overlapping construction phases. 13) Water truck activity can be specified and emissions estimated for the paving phase. 14) Mitigation options were added for on-road vehicles and off-road equipment. Emissions calculations include the effects of mitigations if a mitigation option is selected by the user. 15) Model allows user to estimate emissions from non-default off-road equipment for all phases and for all project types. Non-default off-road equipment specification must be included by equipment type for horsepower, number of equipment, load factor, hours of operation and emission factors in the "Non-default Off-road Equipment" tab. 16) New table of  total project emissions with units of tons/phase was added in the "Emission Estimates" tab. 17) Removed table of daily emissions in metric units from the "Emission Estimates" tab. 18) Removed unnecessary data from all tabs. (Version 7.1.4 to 7.1.5) (updated by SMAQMD 12/11/13 with assistance from ENVIRON Corporation) 1) Grubbing and Land Clearing Phase calculation of active months in 2007, 2017, 2019 fixed. 2) Soil Hauling Emissions calculation to select override if it exists for round trips/day. 3) Worker Commute Emissions calculation of starting and hot soak emissions; drainage phase PM10 emission rate. 4) Water Truck Emissions calculation to select number of months for Grubbing and Land Clearing Phase; maximum acreage/day after 2025. (Version 6.3.2  to Version 7.1.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 7.1.3 & 7.1.4)  (updated by SMAQMD 8/2/13) 1) EMFAC2011 emission factors added (previous EMFAC versions dropped). 2) OFFROAD2011 emission factors added (and fixed error). 3) OFFROAD2007 for categories not in OFFROAD2011 (and fixed error) 4) Project length changed to include calendar years 2009 through 2025. 5) Average Offroad HP by Equipment Type calculation updated and corrected 6) Load Factor Adjustment deactivated (default load factors already incorporated in ARB's calculation of emission factors) 7) Crawler Tractor equipment added to model 8) Air Compressors ROG & Default Excavators calculation on Data Entry sheet corrected. 9) Default equipment list updated 10) Corrections to Worker Commute Emissions calculations Road Construction Emissions Model, Version 8.1.0 Daily Emission Estimates for -> Alt E  Total  Exhaust  Fugitive Dust  Total  Exhaust  Fugitive Dust  Project Phases (Pounds)  ROG (lbs/day)  CO (lbs/day)  NOx (lbs/day)  PM10 (lbs/day)  PM10 (lbs/day)  PM10 (lbs/day)  PM2.5 (lbs/day)  PM2.5 (lbs/day)  PM2.5 (lbs/day)  SOx (lbs/day)  CO2 (lbs/day)  CH4 (lbs/day)  N2O (lbs/day)  CO2e (lbs/day)  Grubbing/Land Clearing  1.15  7.15  14.13  50.59  0.59  50.00  10.93  0.53  10.40  0.02  1,674.89  0.42  0.02  1,691.18  Grading/Excavation  3.55  26.05  38.58  52.00  2.00  50.00  12.20  1.80  10.40  0.04  4,513.43  1.16  0.05  4,556.91  Drainage/Utilities/Sub-Grade  6.25  45.26  64.31  53.39  3.39  50.00  13.56  3.16  10.40  0.07  7,049.28  1.61  0.07  7,109.54  Paving  2.38  18.13  23.20  1.52  1.52  0.00  1.37  1.37  0.00  0.03  2,892.24  0.73  0.03  2,920.13  Maximum (pounds/day)  6.25  45.26  64.31  53.39  3.39  50.00  13.56  3.16  10.40  0.07  7,049.28  1.61  0.07  7,109.54  Total (tons/construction project)  0.52  3.79  5.48  5.90  0.29  5.61  1.43  0.27  1.17  0.01  626.62  0.15  0.01  632.36     Notes:   Project Start Year ->  2017  Project Length (months) ->  12  Total Project Area (acres) ->  52  Maximum Area Disturbed/Day (acres) ->  5  Water Truck Used? ->  Yes Total Material Imported/Exported  Daily VMT (miles/day)  Phase  Volume (Soil  yd3/day) Asphalt  Soil Hauling  Asphalt Hauling  Worker Commute  Water Truck  Grubbing/Land Clearing Grading/Excavation Drainage/Utilities/Sub-Grade Paving 00 00 00 00 0 0 160 40 0 0 680 40 0 0 560 40 0 0 400 40 PM10 and PM2.5 estimates assume 50% control of fugitive dust from watering and associated dust control measures if a minimum number of water trucks are specified.

Total PM10 emissions shown in column F are the sum of exhaust and fugitive dust emissions shown in columns G and H. Total PM2.5 emissions shown in Column I are the sum of exhaust and fugitive dust emissions shown in columns J and K.

Therefore, a local hot spot analyses for conformity purposes is required. Caltrans has developed a Transportation Project-Level Carbon Monoxide Protocol (Protocol) for assessing CO impacts of transportation projects.1 The protocol methodology determines if a project has the potential to exceed State or federal CO standards. Using this methodology, if a project is determined to not have a significant CO impact under these guidelines it would also not be considered to have a significant impact under State of Nevada standards. The procedures and guidelines comply with the following regulations without imposing additional requirements: Section 176(c) of the 1990 CAA Amendments, federal conformity rules, State and local adoptions of the federal conformity rules, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the CEQA requirements [California Code of Regulations Title 21 Section 1509.3(25)]. An explanatory discussion of the steps (as identified in Figure 1 of the Protocol, Requirements for New Projects) used to determine the conformity requirements that apply to new projects is provided below. 3.1.1Is the project exempt from all emissions analyses? (See Table 1 of Protocol.) No. The proposed project is not exempt from all emissions analyses. 3.1.2Is the project exempt from regional emissions analysis? (See Table 2 of Protocol.) No. The proposed project includes the rerouting of U.S. 50. A regional emissions analysis was conducted by the TRPA as part of the Air Quality Conformity Analysis and demonstrated that the emissions are consistent with the motor vehicle emissions budgets and goals of the relevant State Implementation Plans. The proposed project is not exempt from regional emissions analysis. 3.1.3 Is the project locally defined as regionally significant? YES. As mentioned above, the proposed project includes the rerouting of U.S. 50. Therefore, the project is potentially significant. 3.1.4 Is the project in a federal attainment area? NO. The project is located within an attainment/maintenance area for the federal CO standard; therefore, the project is subject to a regional conformity determination. 3.1.5 Are there a currently conforming Regional Transportation Plan [RTP] and transportation improvement program [TIP]? YES. 3.1.6 Is the project included in the regional emissions analysis supporting the currently conforming Regional Transportation Plan [RTP] and transportation improvement program [TIP]? YES. The project is included in the TRPA 2012 RTP and the 2013 FTIP. Project ID: TMC0403, Description: US 50 South Shore Community Revitalization Project (US 50/SR 207 intersection south to Pioneer Trail intersection – realign roadway, reduce lanes, and transit-bike pedestrian lane). 1 California, State of, 1997. Department of Transportation. Transportation Project-Level Carbon Monoxide Protocol. 3.1.7 Has the project design concept and/or scope changed significantly from that in the regional analysis? NO. 3.1.9 Examine local impacts. (Proceed to Section 4.) Section 4 of the Protocol assesses local analysis. Assessment of the project’s effect on localized ambient air quality is based on analysis of CO and PM10 emissions, with the focus on CO. Localized emissions of CO may increase with implementation of the proposed project. CO is used as an indicator of a project’s direct and indirect impact on local air quality, because CO does not readily disperse in the local environment in cool weather when the wind is fairly still. As stated in the Protocol, the determination of project-level CO impacts should be carried out according to the Local Analysis flow chart shown in Figure 2 of the Protocol. The following discussion provides explanatory remarks for every step of the local analysis in Figure 2 of the protocol. Level 1: 4.1.1 Is the project in a CO nonattainment area? NO. The project site is located in an area that has demonstrated attainment with the federal CO standard. 4.1.2Was the area redesignated as “attainment” after the 1990 Clean Air Act? YES. EPA proposed approved the maintenance plans and redesignation request in 1998. (Proceed to Section 4.1.3) 4.1.3Has “continued attainment” been verified with the local Air District, if appropriate? YES. The Tahoe Air Basin continues to be in attainment for CO. (Proceed to Section 4.7 – Level 7). Level 7: 4.7.1 Does the project worsen air quality? NO. The following criteria were used to determine whether the project is likely to worsen air quality: a. Project does not significantly increase the percentage of vehicles operating in cold start mode. Increasing the number of vehicles operating in cold start mode by as little as 2% should be considered potentially significant. The percentage of vehicles operating in cold start mode is the same as compared to those used for the roadway in the attainment plan. It is anticipated that all vehicles operating on the new roadway are in a fully warmed-up mode. Therefore, this condition is met. b. Project does not significantly increase traffic volumes. Increases in traffic volumes in excess of 5% should be considered potentially significant. Increasing the traffic volume by less than 5% may still be potentially significant if there is a corresponding reduction in average speeds. The proposed project would reroute traffic so that it does not increase the average daily traffic (ADT). Refer to analysis in Chapter 3.6 Traffic and Transportation for further details. In addition, there is no reduction in average speeds; the project alternatives generally increase average speeds and reduce delay (see response to c. below for further details on delay). Therefore, this condition is met. c. Project improves traffic flow. For uninterrupted roadway segments, higher average speeds (up to 50 mph) should be regarded as an improvement in traffic flow. For intersection segments, higher average speeds and a decrease in average delay should be considered an improvement in traffic flow. The project would not generate additional 2020 (Opening Day) vehicle trips that could affect intersection operations; rather, it would implement improvements to existing transportation infrastructure and change circulation patterns within the study area. For Alternatives B, C, and D, US 50 would be realigned to connect to and approximately follow the existing Lake Parkway East alignment. Under Alternatives A and E, the existing US 50 roadway alignment would remain the same as existing conditions. The implementation of Alternative C would result in unacceptable intersection LOS at the New US 50/Pioneer Trail/Old US 50, Old US 50/Park Avenue/Heavenly Village Way, and New US 50/Lake Parkway/Old US 50 (roundabout option) intersections during summer peak-hour conditions. Thus, this criterion is not met for all project alternatives. 4.7.2 Is the project suspected of resulting in higher CO concentrations than those existing within the region at the time of attainment demonstration? NO. To demonstrate that the proposed project would not result in any new exceedances, the CO concentrations at the most congested intersections in the project area were modeled. Table 1 lists the peak 1-hour and 8-hour CO concentrations under the with-project conditions. As shown, none of the intersections would result in any concentrations exceeding the 1-hour or 8-hour CO standards. The CO Protocol indicates that further analysis is not necessary. Therefore, a detailed hotspot analysis is not required and CO concentrations would not be expected to exceed federal or State standards. Table 1: 2018 Peak Intersection CO Concentrations (ppm) Intersection  Alternative 1  Alternative 2  Alternative 3  Alternative 4  Exceeds State Standards?  1-Hr  8-Hr  1-Hr  8-Hr  1-Hr  8Hr  1-Hr  8-Hr  1-Hr (20.0 ppm)  8-Hr (6.0 ppm)  U.S. 50/Pioneer Trail  9.4  5.0  9.4  5.0  9.4  5.0  9.1  4.8  No  No  U.S. 50/Park Ave  8.0  4.0  8.2  4.2  9.5  5.1  8.7  4.5  No  No  U.S. 50/Lake Parkway  9.4  5.0  9.7  5.2  9.4  5.0  8.5  4.4  No  No  Park  8.6  4.5  8.6  4.5  8.4  4.3  7.7  3.8  No  No  Ave/Heavenly  Village/Lake  Parkway  Source: LSA Associates, Inc., March 2014. 1 Modeling includes ambient background levels of 6.8 ppm (1-hour) and 3.2 ppm (eight-hour) as measured at the 18 US HWY 50, Stateline Nevada monitoring station and therefore represents existing plus project conditions. Actual project contributions would be less than reported values. 2 Alternative naming is based on previous (2014) alternatives descriptions and therefore Alternative 1 through 4 do not match up with current alternative descriptions of A through E. Further, a new alternative has been added. In addition CO modeling was conducted in 2014 based on previous traffic studies conducted at that time. However, all peak-hour traffic used in the 2014 CO hot spot modeling was compared to opening year (2016) traffic conditions, future year without mixed-use development, and future year with mixed-use development (2038) for the same intersections across all alternatives. In all cases, the 2014 traffic volumes were higher than current (2016 ad 2038) traffic volumes. Modeling used worst-case meteorological conditions and modeling inputs. As such, the CO concentrations in this table is considered conservative and would over-estimate CO concentrations in comparison to actual project CO levels. ppm = parts per million             CALINE4: CALIFORNIA LINE SOURCE DISPERSION MODEL                     JUNE 1989 VERSION                     PAGE  1                JOB: Project Name                RUN: 2018-A1-01  (WORST CASE ANGLE)          POLLUTANT: Carbon Monoxide    I.

Thus, because CO Hot Spot analysis did not result in an exceedence of applicable CO thresholds/standards with higher volumes, CO emissions would be less than previously anticipated. ALT A 2016 Peak Data N App N Dep S App S Dep E App E Dep W App W Dep Intersection Total Intersection #

According to CEC (2007 and 2013), the 2008 Title 24 Standards achieve an electricity energy savings of 22.7% and a natural gas savings of 10.0% for single‐family residences over the 2005 Title 24 Standards. Nonresidential newly constructed buildings under 2008 Title 24 achieved a 4.9% electricity energy savings and a 9.4% natural gas savings compared with the 2005 Title 24 Standards. The 2013 Title 24 Standards achieved a 36.4% electricity energy reduction and a 6.5% natural gas reduction for single‐family residences over the 2008 Title 24 Standards. Nonresidential newly constructed buildings under 2013 Title 24 achieved a 21.8% electricity energy savings and a 16.8% natural gas savings compared with the 2008 Title 24 Standards. The lastest adopted standards are the 2016 Title 24 Standards, which achieved a 28% energy efficiency for residential and a 5% energy efficiency for nonresidential over 2013 Title 24. For the purposes of this analysis, the percent change between the newest (2016) Title 24 standards and the historical data used from CalEEEMod (2005 Title 24 Standards) were calculated using the percent reductions described above for a CalEEMod run for a residential and nonresidential project in El Dorado County. References: http://www.energy.ca.gov/2013publications/CEC‐400‐2013‐008/CEC‐400‐2013‐008.pdf http://www.energy.ca.gov/title24/2008standards/rulemaking/documents/2007‐11‐07_IMPACT_ANA Appendix L Tree Survey Memorandum Memo P.O. Box 5022 Stateline, NV 89449 (916) 444-7301 Date:  March 6, 2014  To: From:  Alfred Knotts, TTD Brian Judge, TRPA Mike Vollmer, TRPA Rachel Kozloski, Ascent Environmental  Subject:  Tree Survey for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project  This memorandum summarizes the methods and results of a tree inventory survey conducted for the proposed US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project. With this memorandum, we are also submitting GIS files used to derive the information contained herein. The purpose of the tree inventory effort was to identify and map trees protected under the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) Code of Ordinances (Code) and to provide sufficient and defensible information related to tree removal to support preparation of the EIS/EIR/EIS. All trees measuring 14 inches or greater diameter at breast height (DBH) within the established Archaeological Area of Potential Effect (APE) (APE map prepared by Wood Rodgers and dated September 12, 2013) were included in the tree inventory. Trees protected under the TRPA Code consist of trees measuring 24 inches or greater DBH in eastside forests or 30 inches or greater DBH in westside forests (the California/Nevada state line serves and the boundary for eastside and westside forests on the South Shore [Section 90.2 of the TRPA Code]), and Tree Species of Limited Occurrence (i.e., aspen, black cottonwood, ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, sugar pine, western white pine, whitebark pine, incense cedar, mountain hemlock, and western juniper) (Section 61.1.6 of the TRPA Code). Methods The APE established for the project encompasses the area that includes the extent of the four action alternatives being considered in environmental review.  The Archaeological APE includes approximately 127 acres of land, much of which is located on private land. Because of the size of the APE and limited access to certain private lands, remote sensing data were used establish the location, DBH size class, and canopy area for the trees within the APE. A field survey was completed to locate and measure TRPA Tree Species of Limited Occurrence within the APE.  As described in the Scope of Work for this task, in order to account for potential growth over the next several years until the project is implemented, trees within 4 inches of the TRPA size criteria were mapped.  Before beginning field work, TRPA’s 2013 “Tree Tops” dataset was reviewed. This dataset is derived from remote sensed LiDAR data obtained in 2010 and provides point locations and DBH for trees within the Tahoe Basin. DBH values in the Tree Tops dataset are derived using tree height and crown diameter. Field verification of the Tree US 50 Tree Survey Memo March 6, 2014 Page 2 Tops dataset was completed by the TRPA contractor who prepared the data. Ascent conducted additional field verification for the portions of the dataset within the APE.  A sample plot was established within the APE to confirm the accuracy of the Tree Tops dataset relative to location and DBH. This plot was located in a mature Jeffrey pine forest and included 70 trees. The accuracy of the LiDAR derived tree locations was found to be within the margin of error of the Magellan Mobile Mapper 120 GPS unit (1 meter) and the accuracy of the calculated DBH figures was found to be within approximately 4 inches of field measured DBH. The results of this sample plot were discussed with Mike Vollmer (TRPA) at a meeting on November 15, 2013, where it was agreed that this level of accuracy would be adequate for the purposes of environmental review, provided that the data were used conservatively (i.e., with a margin of error).  Mike suggested that the entire APE could conservatively be described as eastside forest type.  Mike also agreed with Ascent’s proposed survey protocols, which included a pedestrian survey for Trees of Limited Occurrence and use of vegetation communities to describe the commonly occurring tree species within the APE.  During October and November 2013 an Ascent botanist familiar with tree species of the Tahoe Basin conducted a pedestrian survey of the APE. All TRPA Trees of Limited Occurrence measuring at least 10 inches DBH (measured with a logger’s diameter tape at 4.5 feet above ground surface or at the narrowest point below the crotch of multi‐trunk trees) were marked using a sub‐meter GPS unit and the species and DBH were recorded. As described in the scope, a 4 inch buffer from the 14 inch DBH TRPA standard was include to account for the potential growth of the trees during the life of the project. If obvious structural defects or symptoms of disease or severe decline were observed in a tree, this was noted in the GPS data file. Significant rust or canker infections were noted on 35% of the mature (≥10 inches DBH) aspen trees surveyed with the APE.  During this survey, vegetation communities within the APE were also delineated with GPS and described.  Results Table 1 shows the number of trees proposed for removal under each action alternative based on disturbance footprints (i.e., area of tree removal) provided by Wood Rodgers on October 31, 2013 and included as Attachment A to this memorandum. To provide a conservative assessment of the DBH of trees that would be removed by the proposed project, a 4‐inch buffer was included for each DBH size class as requested by TRPA. This means that the ≥14 to <24‐inch DBH category shown in Table 1 includes trees with a calculated DBH between >10 and <20 inches.  Likewise, the >24 to <30‐inch DBH class reporting category includes trees with a calculated DBH of >20 to <25 inches, and trees with a calculated DBH of 26 inches or above were included in the ≥30‐inch DBH class reporting category. Because the APE is located on the boundary between eastside and westside forest types, trees above 24 inches and 30 inches DBH are also differentiated for both California and Nevada.   Use of the LiDAR data provides an efficient and accurate estimate of the total number of trees that would be removed by the project, and is especially valuable in inaccessible areas. In the sample plots created for this survey, 97 percent of the trees with calculated DBH values of ≥14 inches also had measured DBH values of ≥14 inches.  The LiDAR has greater difficulty differentiating between size classes of larger trees.  Based on the sampling completed for this project, it would be reasonable to expect that approximately 15 percent of the large diameter trees (≥24 inches DBH) shown in Table 1, would have a true measured DBH of less than 20 inches.  US 50 Tree Survey Memo March 6, 2014 Page 3 Table 1. Tree Removal by Alternative Alternative  NV Trees Removed (Diameter at Breast Height)1  CA Trees Removed (Diameter at Breast Height)1  Total Trees Removed (≥14" DBH)  Aspen Stand Removed (sq ft)2  Aspen Removed (≥10" DBH /≥14"DBH)  ≥14<24"   ≥24<30"  ≥30"  ≥14<24"   ≥24<30"  ≥30"  Alt B ‐ Triangle   133  22  17  396  141  118  827  13,725  3/0  Alt C ‐ Triangle One‐Way  164  17  13  248  79  64  585  4,176  9/1  Alt D ‐ PSR Alternative 2  133  22  17  316  106  101  695  13,725  3/0  Alt E ‐ Skywalk  54  10  8  63  25  21  181  0  0/0  1 Tree removal numbers and DBH values are estimated from remote sensed LiDAR data provided by TRPA in 2013. 2  Area of aspen stands, location of mature aspen trees, and aspen DBH from measurements taken during October and November 2013 field surveys. Source: Adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2014.   Two TRPA Tree Species of Limited Occurrence were found within the APE—quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens). Of these two species, only aspen was found within the disturbance footprints of the proposed action alternatives. Because of their clonal growth, aspen commonly form stands. The area of aspen stands within the disturbance footprint of each action alternative is shown in Table 1, in addition to the number of aspen with a measured DBH of greater than 10 inches and 14 inches, respectively. Maps of each alternative showing the distribution of trees by size class as well as the location of Trees of Limited Occurrence are provided in Attachment A. An Excel spreadsheet is also provided showing trees removed by alternative (with cross references tree identification numbers) in Appendix B.p US 50 Tree Survey Memo March 6, 2014 Page 4 Attachment A Disturbance Footprint and Tree Removal Maps for Each Action Alternative !

Alpine lakes inhabited by mountain yellow-legged frogs generally have grassy or muddy margin habitat, although below treeline sandy and rocky shores may be preferred. Suitable stream habitat can be highly variable, from high gradient streams with plunge pools and waterfalls, to low gradient sections through alpine meadows. Low-gradient streams are preferred because breeding and tadpole development cannot occur in streams with fast-moving water. Small streams are generally unoccupied and have no potential breeding locations because of the lack of depth for overwintering and refuge. Although Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs have been observed successfully breeding in shallow locations less than 7 feet deep, typically depth is an important factor for breeding locations since adults and larvae require overwintering habitat. For up to nine months, adults and larvae will live/hibernate below ice, or in nonfrozen portions of ponds or lakes, so adequate depth (greater than 2 m) is necessary to avoid having the pond or lake freeze through.  Potential to Occur or Be Affected on the Project Site2 Wilderness. Limited occurrence records are also present on the Tahoe National Forest, with the largest known population in the Soda Springs area. However, no known occurrences are near the project site. Additionally, suitable habitat is not present on the project site because of hydrologic conditions, presence of predators (e.g., nonnative trout), and disturbed aquatic habitat.  TRPA/ Federal  State/ Other  Waterfowl species (collectively)  TRPA  –  Nest and roost in wetlands and around waters such as lakes, creeks, drainages, marshes, and wet meadows.  Low - nesting habitat. Marginal nesting habitat is present on the project site, primarily due to the level of recreational and other disturbances. However, waterfowl species may occasionally use the area for resting and foraging.  Northern goshawk  TRPA  C-SSC, NNHP-AR  In the Sierra Nevada, this species generally requires mature conifer forests with large trees, snags, downed logs, dense canopy cover, and open understories for nesting; aspen stands also are used for nesting. Foraging habitat includes forests with dense to moderately open overstories and open understories interspersed with meadows, brush patches, riparian areas, or other natural or artificial openings. Goshawks reuse old nest structures and maintain alternate nest sites.  Low. Potential foraging habitat is present on the project site, however it is highly disturbed.  Accipiter gentilis  Table M-2 Special-Status Animal Species Evaluated for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project Common Name and Scientific Name  Regulatory Status1  Habitat Associations  Potential to Occur or Be Affected on the Project Site2  TRPA/ Federal  State/ Other  Northern harrier  –  C-SSC  Found in a variety of open grassland, wetland, and agricultural habitats. Open wetland habitats used for breeding include marshy meadows, wet and lightly grazed pastures, and freshwater and brackish marshes. Breeding habitat also includes dry upland habitats, such as grassland, cropland, drained marshland, and shrub-steppe in cold deserts. Winters throughout California where suitable habitat occurs. Wintering habitat includes open areas dominated by herbaceous vegetation, such as grassland, pastures, cropland, coastal sand dunes, brackish and freshwater marshes, and estuaries (Grinnell and Miller 1944, MacWhirter and Bildstein 1996).  Low. Suitable habitat is not present on the project site.  Circus cyaneus  Bald eagle  TRPA  C-SE, CFP, NNHP-AR  Use ocean shorelines, lake margins, and river courses for both nesting and wintering. Most nests are within 1 mile of water, in large trees with open branches. Roost communally in winter.  Low. In the Tahoe Basin, bald eagle is known to nest only in two locations (Emerald Bay and Marlette Lake). Potential perch sites may be located on the project site, due to the close proximity to Lake Tahoe, and the project site could be used during winter. However, use of the project site would be limited due to the level of disturbance and the presence of more suitable habitat located nearby.  Haliaeetus leucocephalus  Golden eagle  TRPA, BGEPA  C-FP  Mountains and foothills throughout California. Nest on cliffs and escarpments or in tall trees.  Low. Suitable nesting habitat is not present on the project site, and golden eagle is rare in the Tahoe area. Due to disturbance levels and habitat quality on the project site, and higher quality habitat outside the project site, golden eagle is not expected to nest or forage on the project site.  Aquila chrysaetos  Osprey  TRPA  –  Associated with large fish-bearing waters. Nest usually within 0.25 mile of fish-producing water, but may nest up to 1.5 miles from water. In the Tahoe Basin, osprey nests are distributed primarily along the Lake Tahoe shoreline, at the northern portion of the east shore and southern portion of the west shore. Other osprey nest sites in the Tahoe Basin occur along the shorelines of smaller lakes (e.g., Fallen Leaf Lake) and in forest uplands up to 1.5 miles from lakes.  Low. Osprey nests and forages in suitable habitat throughout the Tahoe Region; however, osprey does not nest on the project site. Potential perch sites and are present on the project site. However, use of the project site by osprey would likely be limited due to high levels of disturbance the presence of more suitable habitat located nearby on Lake Tahoe.  Pandion haliaetus  Peregrine falcon  TRPA  C- FP, NNHP-AR  Nest and roost on protected ledges of high cliffs, usually adjacent to water bodies and wetlands that support abundant avian prey.

Nesting habitat is generally characterized by dense canopy closure (i.e., greater than 70 percent) with medium to large trees and multistoried stands (i.e., at least two canopy layers). Foraging habitat can include intermediate to late-successional forest with greater than 40 percent canopy cover.  Low. Potential foraging habitat is present on the project site, but the area is highly disturbed. More suitable habitat exists nearby.  Strix occidentalis occidentalis  Long-eared owl  –  C-SSC  Found in a variety of habitat types throughout its range. Nest in woodland, forest, and open settings (e.g., grassland, shrub-steppe, and desert). Occupy wooded and nonwooded areas that support relatively dense vegetation (e.g., trees, shrubs) adjacent to or within larger open areas such as grasslands or meadows (i.e., habitat edges) (Bloom 1994; Marks, Evans, and Holt 1994). This species also has been documented breeding in contiguous conifer forest habitat with heavy mistletoe infestation (Bull, Wright, and Henjum 1989). Trees and shrubs used for nesting and roosting include oaks, willows, cottonwoods, conifers, and junipers (Marks, Evans, and Holt 1994).  Low. Potential habitat is present on the project site, but it is highly disturbed.  Asio otus  Great gray owl  –  C-SE  Found in Central Sierra mature mixed conifer forests near meadows. Scattered along the west slope of the Sierra, between 4,500 and 7,500 feet elevation, from Plumas County to Yosemite National Park.  None. Suitable habitat is not present on the project site, and the species has not been documented in the area.  Strix nebulosa  Willow flycatcher  –  C-SE  In the Sierra Nevada, suitable habitat typically consists of montane meadows that support riparian deciduous shrubs (particularly willows) and remain wet through the nesting season (i.e., midsummer). Important characteristics of suitable meadows include a high water table that results in standing or slow-moving water, or saturated soils (e.g., “swampy” conditions) during the breeding season; abundant riparian deciduous shrub cover (particularly willow); and riparian shrub structure with moderate to high foliar density that is uniform from the ground to the shrub canopy. Most breeding occurrences are in meadows larger than 19 acres, but the average size of occupied meadows is approximately 80 acres. Although less common in the Sierra  Low. Riparian/meadow habitat with suitable vegetation structure and hydrology is not present on the project site.  Empidonax traillii  Table M-2 Special-Status Animal Species Evaluated for the US 50/South Shore Community Revitalization Project Common Name and Scientific Name  Regulatory Status1  Habitat Associations Nevada, riparian habitat along streams also can function as suitable habitat for willow flycatcher. However, those areas must support the hydrologic and vegetation characteristics described for suitable meadows (e.g., standing or slow-moving water, and abundant and dense riparian vegetation).  Potential to Occur or Be Affected on the Project Site2  TRPA/ Federal  State/ Other  Olive-sided flycatcher  –  C-SSC  Summer resident and migrant that breeds primarily in late-succession conifer forest with open canopy.

Vegetation types preferred include wet meadows and willow-alder– dominated riparian corridors typically near water sources. Suitable riparian habitats are characterized by dense growth of small deciduous trees and shrubs near permanent water. Mountain beaver is generally solitary, except during its short breeding season; beavers spend a high proportion of their time in extensive underground burrow systems with multiple openings, tunnels, and food caches.  Low. Potential habitat is very limited on the project site, and the area is heavily disturbed by recreation activities.  Aplodontia rufa californica  Pale Townsend’s big-eared bat  –  C-SSC,  Range throughout California, mostly in mesic habitats. Limited by available roost sites (i.e., caves, tunnels, mines, and buildings).  Low. Suitable habitat not present on the project site. Until 2007, no occurrences reported within the Tahoe Basin. However, this species was detected several miles from the project site in Blackwood Canyon and Cookhouse Meadow in 2007.  Corynorhinus townsendii pallescens  WBWG-H  California wolverine  FPT  C-ST,  Inhabit upper montane and alpine habitats of Sierra Nevada, Cascades, Klamath, and north Coast Ranges.

Fishers are considered extirpated throughout much of the Central and Northern Sierra Nevada (Zielinski, Kucera, and Barrett 1995). No longer considered present in the Tahoe Basin; no current records.  None. Considered extirpated from the Tahoe Region.  Martes pennanti pacifica  Mule deer  TRPA  –  Year-long resident or elevational migrant that prefer a wide distribution of various-aged vegetation for cover, meadow, and forest openings, and free water. In the Sierra Nevada, early to midsuccessional forests, woodlands, and riparian and brush habitats are preferred because of the greater diversity of shrubby vegetation and woody cover. In addition to forage, vegetative cover is critical for thermoregulation. Suitable habitats include a mosaic of vegetation such as forest or meadow openings, dense woody thickets and brush, edge habitat, and riparian areas. Fawning habitat, used by does during birth and by newborn fawns, is of critical importance for reproductive success. A diversity of thermal cover, hiding cover, succulent forage, and water are needed during fawning. Optimal deer fawning habitat has been described as having moderate to dense shrub cover near forest cover and water, such as riparian zones. A source of surface water (e.g., creek or river) is especially important to mule deer. Typical fawning habitat varies in size, but an area of 5–26 acres is adequate, with optimal fawn-rearing habitat of around 400 acres.  Low. Potential habitat in the project site is marginal and highly disturbed. There is no suitable fawning habitat present on the project site.  Odocoileus hemionus  American water shrew  –  NNHP-AR  This species prefers small, cold mountain streams or other bodies of water; utilizing heavy vegetation, logs and rocks for cover.
