EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
ES.1 PROJECT LOCATION AND SETTING
The California Tahoe Conservancy (Conservancy), U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), and Tahoe
Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) are pursuing a restoration project along the most downstream reach of the
Upper Truckee River, at the mouth of Lake Tahoe. The Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project is
identified in TRPA’s Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) as a project that is necessary to restore and
maintain environmental thresholds for the Lake Tahoe Basin (EIP Project #s 560, 650, 981, and 1002). EIP
projects are designed to achieve and maintain environmental thresholds that protect Tahoe’s unique and valued
resources.
The 592-acre study area is located in South Lake Tahoe, California, bounded by U.S. Highway 50 (U.S. 50) and
the Highland Woods neighborhood to the south, the Al Tahoe neighborhood to the east, Tahoe Islands/Sky
Meadows and Tahoe Keys neighborhoods to the west, and Lake Tahoe to the north. It consists of parcels owned
by the Conservancy, the City of South Lake Tahoe (CSLT), the California Department of Transportation
(Caltrans), and private landowners. It includes the downstream reaches of Trout Creek and the Upper Truckee
River, adjacent wetland (Upper Truckee Marsh) and upland habitats, and the Lower West Side Wetlands
Restoration Project site (located in the northwest portion of the study area, just east of the Tahoe Keys Marina).
The primary purpose of the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project is to restore natural geomorphic
processes and ecological functions along this reach of river while providing recreation access. Four alternative
approaches to implementing the proposed project are being considered, along with the No-Project/No-Action
Alternative. Depending on which alternative is selected, the proposed restoration project may include a minimum,
moderate, or maximum recreation component (described below).

ES.2 OVERVIEW OF THE EIR/EIS/EIS PROCESS
This joint document is an environmental impact report (EIR) prepared on behalf of the Conservancy pursuant to
the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA); an environmental impact statement (EIS) prepared on behalf
of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) pursuant to Article VII of the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact
and Chapter 3 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances; and an EIS prepared on behalf of the U.S. Bureau of
Reclamation (Reclamation) pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Council of
Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations implementing NEPA.

ES.2.1

CALIFORNIA TAHOE CONSERVANCY

The Conservancy is a lead agency for this project, pursuant to CEQA. As part of its environmental review
process, the Conservancy, jointly with TRPA, prepared and circulated a Notice of Preparation (NOP) informing
responsible agencies and the public that the project could have a significant effect on the environment, and
soliciting their comments. The NOP was filed with the California and Nevada State Clearinghouses and released
publicly on October 4, 2006. The NOP identified November 2, 2006 as the closing date for submitting scoping
comments. A continuation was filed on March 13, 2007, to extend the closing date for scoping comments to April
30, 2007. A copy is included in Appendix A of this Draft EIR/Draft EIS/Draft EIS (DEIR/DEIS/DEIS). This
DEIR/DEIS/DEIS addresses comments received during the NOP scoping period.
Section 21091(a) of the California Public Resources Code requires lead agencies to circulate DEIRs for a
minimum of 45 days. However, because this document is also an EIS, pursuant to the TRPA Code of Ordinances
and NEPA, it is being circulated for at least 60 days. During this time, the Conservancy is holding a public
hearing to present the conclusions of the DEIR/DEIS/DEIS and receive oral comments from the public and
responsible agencies. After the 60-day comment period, a Final EIR/EIS/EIS will be prepared that includes

ES.2.2

U.S. BUREAU OF RECLAMATION

Reclamation is a lead agency for the project, pursuant to NEPA. The project has received federal funding through
Reclamation for the planning phase and may receive funding for implementation. As part of its environmental
review process, a Notice of Intent (NOI) was published in the Federal Register on September 5, 2006, informing
federal agencies and the public that the project could have a significant effect on the environment, and soliciting
their comments. A copy of the NOI is included in Appendix A of this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS.
Pursuant to Reclamation procedures, this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS is being circulated for public comment for at least 60
days. After the 60-day comment period, a Final EIR/EIS/EIS will be prepared as described above under Section
ES.2.1.

ES.2.3

TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY

TRPA is a lead environmental review agency for the project, pursuant to Article VII of the Tahoe Regional
Planning Compact and the TRPA Code of Ordinances. The NOP prepared by the Conservancy also served as the
NOP under the Tahoe Regional Planning code. A copy is included in Appendix A of this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS.
Pursuant to Section 3.7.1 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances, this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS is being circulated for public
comment for at least 60 days and a public hearing will be held in front of the Governing Board. After the 60-day
comment period, a Final EIR/EIS/EIS will be prepared as described above under Section ES.2.1.

ES.3 SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT ALTERNATIVES
ES.3.1

PURPOSE AND NEED AND PROJECT OBJECTIVES

The need for the project originates from the environmental degradation that the Upper Truckee River has
historically experienced as a result of human alterations to the river and watershed. The purpose of the proposed
action is to restore natural geomorphic processes and ecological functions in this lowest reach of the Upper
Truckee River and the surrounding marsh to improve ecological values of the restoration area and help reduce the
river’s discharge of nutrients and sediment that diminish Lake Tahoe’s clarity.
The following basic objectives of the project were developed for the proposed action to meet the purpose and
need:
►

Objective 1: Restore natural and self-sustaining river and floodplain processes and functions.

►

Objective 2: Protect, enhance, and restore naturally functioning habitats.

►

Objective 3: Restore and enhance fish and wildlife habitat quality.

►

Objective 4: Improve water quality through enhancement of natural physical and biological processes.

►

Objective 5: Protect and, where feasible, expand Tahoe yellow cress populations.

►

Objective 6: Provide public access, access to vistas, and environmental education at the Lower West Side and
Cove East Beach consistent with other objectives.

►

Objective 7: Avoid increasing flood hazards on adjacent private property.

►

Objective 8: Design with sensitivity to the site’s historical and cultural heritage.

►

Objective 9: Design the wetland/urban interface to help provide habitat value and water quality benefits.

►

Objective 10: Implement a public health and safety program, including mosquito monitoring and control.

Five alternatives are being considered and are analyzed at a comparable level of detail in this environmental
document. A preferred or proposed alternative has not yet been defined. Following receipt and evaluation of
public comments on the DEIR/DEIS/DEIS, the lead agencies will determine which alternative or combinations of
features from multiple alternatives will become the preferred alternative. A discussion of the decision will be
included in the Final EIR/EIS/EIS.
A summary description of the alternatives is presented below. The detailed description of each alternative is
presented in Chapter 2.

ES.3.2

ALTERNATIVE 1. CHANNEL AGGRADATION AND NARROWING (MAXIMUM RECREATION
INFRASTRUCTURE)

To restore the river channel and its connection to the floodplain, Alternative 1 would increase channel length and
decrease channel capacity. A key element of this restoration would be the use of engineering elements (primarily
structures in the channel) to cause sediment deposition that raises the channel bed and decreases channel capacity,
and would slightly reduce the capacity of the channel mouth at Lake Tahoe. Alternative 1 would also restore a
natural-functioning lagoon in the vicinity of the existing Sailing Lagoon, lagoon and wet meadow conditions at
the Trout Creek Lagoon, floodplain functions at the TKPOA Corporation Yard (contingent on TKPOA consent),
and sand ridges (“dunes”) at Cove East Beach. In addition, Alternative 1 would remove user-created trails within
the “core habitat” area that contains sensitive marsh habitats within the center of the study area.
Under Alternatives 1–4, public access and recreation infrastructure is proposed near the perimeter of the study
area. Alternative 1 provides a potential “maximum” level of public access and recreation infrastructure that
includes parking, two kiosks, stabilization of an existing river access for boat take-out, observation areas,
boardwalks, and a connected system of bicycle paths. Bicycle paths would be Class I/Shared-Use Paths (as
described in TRPA and TMPO 2010). Bridges over Trout Creek and the Upper Truckee River (and a boardwalk)
would connect the proposed bicycle paths. Bicycle paths would connect to existing regional trails near the study
area.

ES.3.3

ALTERNATIVE 2. NEW CHANNEL – WEST MEADOW (MINIMUM RECREATION
INFRASTRUCTURE)

To restore the river channel and its connection to the floodplain, Alternative 2 would directly raise the streambed
elevation, increase the channel length, and decrease channel capacity. A key element of this restoration would be
the excavation of a new river channel that has less capacity than the existing channel. The existing river mouth
would be replaced with a new smaller river mouth, similar in size to the historical river mouth prior to dredging.
Unlike Alternative 1, the river channel and floodplain restoration elements of Alternative 2 would require two
existing stormwater discharge locations to be modified and/or relocated. Alternative 2 also includes all of the
other restoration and enhancement elements of Alternative 1.
Alternative 2 would provide a “minimum” level of public access and recreation infrastructure that includes
signage, a modified pedestrian trail to Cove East Beach (which would be Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
accessible), five viewpoints, a boat take-out, and a fishing platform. Except for four viewpoints along the eastern

Executive Summary

perimeter of the study area, adjacent to the Al Tahoe neighborhood and the boat take-out near U.S. 50, this
infrastructure is located from Venice Drive to Cove East Beach.

ES.3.4

ALTERNATIVE 3. MIDDLE MARSH CORRIDOR (MODERATE RECREATION INFRASTRUCTURE)

To restore the river channel and its connection to the floodplain, Alternative 3 would promote the development,
through natural processes, of a new main channel and/or distributary channels in the central portion of the study
area. A “pilot” channel, similar to the channel segments constructed under Alternatives 1 and 2, would be
constructed from the existing river channel in the southern portion of the study area and connected to historical
channels in the center of the study area. No construction would occur in the central or northern portions of the
study area, rather, natural processes would be allowed to dictate the flow path(s), bed and bank elevations, and
capacities of the channel(s) through the central and northern portions of the study area. The existing river mouth
would be retained, but its capacity would be reduced. In addition, by boring two culverts under U.S. 50, an area of
isolated floodplain would be reactivated. The river channel and floodplain restoration elements of Alternative 3
would require two existing stormwater discharge locations to be modified and/or relocated. Also, like Alternatives
1 and 2, Alternative 3 would restore a natural-functioning lagoon in the vicinity of the Sailing Lagoon and
floodplain functions at the TKPOA Corporation Yard and would enhance areas of “core habitat” and forest.
However, Alternative 3 would not restore lagoon and wet meadow conditions at the Trout Creek Lagoon (by
removal of existing fill) or dunes at Cove East Beach.
Alternative 3 would provide a “moderate” level of public access and recreation infrastructure that includes three
pedestrian trails, a bicycle path, a kiosk, one observation area, six viewpoints, a fishing platform, a boat take-out
area, and signage at multiple locations. Similar to Alternative 2, the modified pedestrian trail to Cove East Beach
would be ADA accessible, a fishing platform would be installed at the restored lagoon, and stabilization of an
existing boat take-out area near U.S. 50. Alternative 3 would include a bicycle path and a pedestrian trail near the
Highland Woods neighborhood (and connected to Macinaw Road), and a pedestrian trail adjacent to the Al Tahoe
neighborhood, from Capistrano Avenue to East Barton Beach (two segments of which would be boardwalks).

ES.3.5

ALTERNATIVE 4. INSET FLOODPLAIN (MODERATE RECREATION INFRASTRUCTURE)

To restore the river channel and its connection to the floodplain, Alternative 4 would lower bank heights by
excavating an inset floodplain along much of the river channel and by localized cut and fill to create meanders in
the existing straightened reach. The existing river mouth would be retained and its capacity would not be reduced.
Although Alternative 4 would include the enhancement of core and forest habitats, it would not include the
restoration of floodplain functions at the TKPOA Corporation Yard, a natural-functioning lagoon in the vicinity
of the existing Sailing Lagoon, or dunes at Cove East Beach.
Similar to Alternative 3, Alternative 4 would provide a “moderate” level of public access and recreation
infrastructure that includes a bicycle path, two pedestrian trails, a kiosk, stabilization of an existing river access
for boat take-out, two observation areas, five viewpoints, and signage at multiple locations. The bicycle path
would be adjacent to the Highland Woods neighborhood (and connected to Macinaw Road), and the pedestrian
trails would be near the Tahoe Keys, from Venice Drive to Cove East Beach (in part replacing the existing
pedestrian trail), and adjacent to the Al Tahoe neighborhood, from Capistrano Avenue to San Francisco Avenue
(one segment of which would be a boardwalk).

ES.3.6

ALTERNATIVE 5. NO PROJECT/NO ACTION

Alternative 5 would not provide any actions to restore the river channel and its connection to the floodplain in the
study area. This alternative would allow but not facilitate the long-term, passive recovery of the river system via
natural processes. The existing river mouth location, size, and bed elevation would continue to adjust to lake
levels, streamflows, and sediment loads. The previously eliminated Upper Truckee River–lagoon connection
would not be restored, leaving the direct open-water connection between the Tahoe Keys Marina channel, the

Sailing Lagoon, and Lake Tahoe unchanged. The previously leveled area between Cove East Beach and the
Sailing Lagoon would not be modified. Alternative 5 would not protect an extensive area of core habitat.
However, the Conservancy has been decommissioning some user-created trails, and similar actions would likely
continue to be implemented.
Alternative 5 would not take any direct steps to construct additional, extensive public access and recreation
infrastructure. However, this alternative would likely maintain existing infrastructure and might result in the
construction of some additional, smaller elements (i.e., signage).

ES.3.7

ALTERNATIVES AND ALTERNATIVE ELEMENTS CONSIDERED BUT ELIMINATED FROM
FURTHER EVALUATION

Off-site alternatives were eliminated from further evaluation because off-site alternatives would not fulfill the
purpose and primary objectives of the project. An important part of the project’s purpose and objectives is to
restore natural geomorphic processes and ecological functions to improve ecological values of the study area and
help reduce the river’s discharge of nutrients and sediment that diminish Lake Tahoe’s clarity, while still
providing access to vistas and environmental education to the public. Off-site actions upstream along the Upper
Truckee River or elsewhere in the watershed could reduce the river’s discharge of nutrients and sediment but
would not substantially improve ecological values of the study area.
While the four preliminary conceptual alternatives were being developed and refined, several facilities were
removed from the alternatives, in particular a full-service visitor center and restrooms. As described further
below, these facilities were determined to be inconsistent with the project objectives and the principles for
alternative development given above.
Initial conceptual plans for Alternative 1 included a full-service visitor center located near the end of Venice
Drive. This facility was included to ensure that the maximum amount of feasible recreational infrastructure was
considered. However, the need for visitor centers on the south shore has been largely met by the Taylor Creek
Visitor Center, the Meyers Visitor Center, and the Explore Tahoe Visitor Center. The creation of a full-service
visitor center on the project site would be an unnecessary duplication of services provided in multiple nearby
locations. A full-service visitor center would require substantial operations and maintenance costs, which would
place an ongoing financial burden on the State while providing services that exist elsewhere. The facility was
therefore removed from the alternative.
Furthermore, a full-service visitor center was determined to be inconsistent with the scale and type of use of the
site and of the study area as a whole. The site is located adjacent to a residential neighborhood, has a small beach
area, and is generally used for dispersed recreation. A visitor center would have the potential to attract an
increased number of users seeking an interior interpretive experience. The resulting type and amount of use could
negatively affect the existing dispersed uses, which are more compatible with the size and setting of the site in the
study area. Therefore, a full service-visitor center has been replaced with a kiosk that is compatible with the size
and setting of the study area. In addition, the infrastructure required to support a visitor center would be
inconsistent with the limitations of the site.
Initial conceptual plans for Alternatives 1, 3, and 4 also included restrooms at the full-service visitor center and at
Cove East Beach. However, refinement of the alternatives reduced the need for these facilities, and it was
determined that the reduced need would be met by the restrooms at the Tahoe Keys Marina. In part, the restroom
facilities were intended to support a full-service visitor center, which has been removed from the alternatives.

ES.4 KEY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, MITIGATION MEASURES, ISSUES
TO BE RESOLVED, AND AREAS OF CONTROVERSY
This DEIR/DEIS/DEIS is a full-scope environmental document that evaluates a broad range of potential
environmental impacts at a comparable level of detail for all five alternatives. The analysis identifies and
addresses several key environmental issues where significant or potentially significant effects on the environment
would occur. Where significant or potentially significant impacts are identified, the document describes feasible
mitigation measures. The summary of impacts and mitigation measures for the alternatives addressed in the
DEIR/DEIS/DEIS is presented in Table ES-1 below.
Regarding issues to be resolved and areas of controversy (a requirement of CEQA for the summary), several
issues have been the subject of public and/or affected agency interest. These are the key issues for which
controversy may arise or that will require resolution during the consideration of a preferred alternative. The issues
are summarized, as follows:
►

Installation of a bridge over the mouth of the Upper Truckee River and associated scenic and Tahoe yellow
cress impacts (Alternative 1).

►

Potential for flooding-related changes in the neighborhood west of the study area (Alternatives 1, 2, 3, and 4).

►

Potential for long-term disruption of fish passage and migration patterns as the channel adjusts (Alternative 3).

►

Short-term risks of erosion, turbidity, and water quality impacts from construction associated with river
restoration and the maturation period following construction (Alternatives 1, 2, 3, and 4).

►

Changes in public access for recreation users (Alternatives 1, 2, 3, and 4).

►

Potential for noise and scenic impacts to nearby residences (Alternatives 1, 2, 3, and 4).

This DEIR/DEIS/DEIS evaluates the potentially adverse and beneficial impacts on the human and natural
environment resulting from implementation of the proposed Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project,
hereinafter referred to as “the project”. It also serves as the “proposed action” under NEPA and the “proposed
project” under CEQA and the TRPA Code of Ordinances. The DEIR/DEIS/DEIS proposes mitigation measures
and alternatives that may reduce or avoid significant adverse impacts. Following public review of the
DEIR/DEIS/DEIS, a final EIR/EIS/EIS (FEIR/FEIS/FEIS) will be prepared, in which the joint lead agencies will
respond to comments relating to the environmental analysis provided in the DEIR/DEIS/DEIS.
This chapter of the DEIR/DEIS/DEIS provides introductory information to orient the reader to the project and the
environmental analysis, which are described in detail in other chapters.

1.1

PROJECT REQUIRING ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS

The Conservancy, Reclamation, and TRPA are pursuing a restoration project along the most downstream reach of
the Upper Truckee River, next to Lake Tahoe (Exhibit 1-1). The study area for the project is generally bounded by
U.S. Highway 50 and the Highland Woods neighborhood on the south, the Al Tahoe neighborhood on the east,
the Tahoe Island/Sky Meadows and Tahoe Keys neighborhoods on the west, and Lake Tahoe to the north
(Exhibit 1-2).

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Introduction and Statement of Purpose and Need

The study area for the project is approximately 592 acres and includes parcels owned by the Conservancy, other
public agencies, and private landowners (Exhibit 1-2). It includes the downstream reaches of Trout Creek and the
Upper Truckee River, adjacent wetland (Upper Truckee Marsh) and upland habitats, and the Lower West Side
Wetlands Restoration Project site (located in the northwest portion of the study area, just east of the Tahoe Keys
Marina). The primary purpose of the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project is to restore natural
geomorphic processes and ecological functions along this reach of river.
The Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project is identified in TRPA’s Environmental Improvement
Program (EIP) as a project that is necessary to restore and maintain environmental thresholds for the Tahoe Basin.
EIP projects are designed to achieve and maintain environmental threshold carrying capacities that protect the
Tahoe Basin’s unique and valued resources. An extensive evaluation and restoration planning process has been
conducted to identify potentially feasible approaches for restoration of the river and marsh. As a result of that
process, the following five alternatives—four action alternatives and a No-Project/No-Action Alternative—have
been evaluated at an equal level of detail in this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS:
►
►
►
►
►

Alternative 1. Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
Alternative 2. New Channel—West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure)
Alternative 3. Middle Marsh Corridor (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
Alternative 4. Inset Floodplain (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
Alternative 5. No-Project/No-Action

These alternatives are named for their approach to restoring the Upper Truckee River and the associated level of
recreation infrastructure. Although the recreation and restoration components have been combined in the
alternatives for the analysis, the Conservancy may choose to implement a different combination than presented.
Also, restoration and recreation components would be refined during design development after selection of an
alternative.It is expected that the analysis in this EIR/EIS/EIS sufficiently addresses the potential environmental
effects resulting from implementing these recreational and restoration components, regardless of the ultimate
combination, because the alternatives evaluated encompass the reasonable range of potential environmental
effects.
For a detailed discussion of these four action alternatives and the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, see
Chapter 2, “Project Alternatives.”

1.2

PROJECT HISTORY AND PLANNING CONTEXT

Restoration planning for the Upper Truckee Marsh and Restoration Project began in the early 1990s with studies
conducted by the University of California. In 1995, the Conservancy commissioned a restoration planning and
design study, which identified a tentatively preferred river restoration concept two years later. The study
determined that river restoration required using the entire Upper Truckee Marsh east of the Tahoe Keys Marina
and subdivision. At that time the center and east side of the marsh were privately owned; therefore, this
tentatively selected concept could not be pursued. In 1998, the Conservancy began planning and designing an
initial phase of wetland restoration called the Lower West Side Wetland Restoration Project (LWS Project). The
LWS Project was located on a 23-acre portion of a study area on the west side of the Upper Truckee River near
Lake Tahoe. In this area, the marsh had been filled during the construction of the adjacent Tahoe Keys (Exhibit 1­
2). After careful investigations, planning, and design; extensive environmental review; and community outreach,
the Conservancy approved restoration of 12 acres of wetland on the 23-acre site through fill removal as the LWS
Project in 2001. The removed fill was used to restore a former quarry at Washoe Meadows State Park in Meyers,
California. Construction began in Summer 2001 and was completed in Summer 2003.
In 2000, the Conservancy purchased 311 acres of land in the center and east side of the marsh from a private
party, bringing nearly the entire Upper Truckee Marsh into public ownership. Currently, the majority of the study
area is owned by the Conservancy, including the marsh and meadows surrounding the lower reach of Trout Creek.

California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

Restoration concepts encompassing the marsh and the lower reach of the river have been developed since the
acquisition. As part of this process, the Conservancy has planned for public access facilities and recreation use
management for the river, marsh, and beach.
Development of the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project has proceeded through a sequence of
several planning stages. Initially, the Conservancy defined project objectives and desired outcomes to direct the
restoration planning process. The Conservancy evaluated and documented the existing natural processes and
functions in the study area to begin the formulation and evaluation of alternative plans. This evaluation enabled
the identification of potential restoration opportunities and constraints. With detailed information about the river
and marsh processes and ecological functions, the Conservancy hosted a design charrette (i.e., interactive
workshop) for agencies and other stakeholders to identify the spectrum of potentially feasible restoration ideas to
be considered in the development of concept plan alternatives. Four alternative concept plans, all developed to be
potentially feasible, were formulated to represent a reasonable range of restoration approaches and levels of public
access and recreation facilities. These concepts were refined through hydrologic modeling, regulatory agency
review, development of schematic designs, and monitoring. After refinement, the four concepts generated by this
extensive planning process became the four action alternatives being evaluated with the No-Project/No-Action
Alternative in the DEIR/DEIS/DEIS.
A preferred alternative has not yet been identified. It will be selected after the public has reviewed the five
alternatives and provided comments on the DEIR/DEIS/DEIS. The preferred alternative may be one of the five
evaluated in the DEIR/DEIS/DEIS, or it may involve a combination of features presented in those alternatives.
To date, key stages of the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project have consisted of:
►

evaluating existing natural processes and functions of the Upper Truckee River and marsh in 2000 and 2001;

►

establishing project objectives and desired outcomes in 2002 and updating them in 2005;

►

defining restoration opportunities and constraints in 2002 and 2003;

►

conducting a restoration design charrette in 2003 to receive input from stakeholders on project priorities,
concerns, and constraints, and design ideas;

►

conducting hydraulic modeling studies to support the development and evaluation of alternatives, and initial
development and comparative evaluation of four conceptual restoration alternatives in 2004 and 2005;

►

regulatory agency review of alternative concepts for key issues and regulatory requirements in 2005;

►

further refining and evaluating the alternatives and preparing a concept plan report in 2006;

►

developing detailed schematic design drawings in 2007;

►

preparing a comprehensive monitoring plan in 2008 that describes a 10-year period of monitoring for the
project to characterize baseline conditions, track project performance related to objectives, establish tentative
approaches to monitoring for regulatory requirements and construction impacts, and provide information for
adaptive management; and

►

analyzing environmental impacts of the five alternatives and preparing this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS since 2009.

PURPOSE AND NEED, AND PROJECT OBJECTIVES

NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1502.13) require that an EIS contain a statement of the purpose and need that “briefly
specif[ies] the underlying purpose and need to which the agency is responding in proposing the alternatives,

including the proposed action.” State CEQA Guidelines CCR Section 15124(b) requires that the project
description contain a clear statement of the project objectives, including the underlying purpose of the project. In
the TRPA Compact and Code of Ordinances, there are no requirements specifically addressing the description of
a project’s purpose and need, or a project’s objectives.

1.3.1

PURPOSE AND NEED

Past actions have created a need to restore river and floodplain ecosystems in the Tahoe Basin to improve the
clarity of Lake Tahoe and the ecological functions of riparian, wetland, and floodplain ecosystems, including the
provision of wildlife habitat. Lake Tahoe is designated as an Outstanding National Resource Water, renowned
worldwide for its clarity and purity (Lahontan RWQCB 1995). However, Lake Tahoe’s clarity has declined by
nearly 20 percent since 1968 (USGS 1997). Studies over the last three decades suggest that the reduction in water
clarity of Lake Tahoe is correlated with the delivery of fine sediments from various watersheds in the basin and
increased phytoplankton productivity, which in turn has been attributed to an increase in nutrients, especially
nitrogen and phosphorus (Goldman 1974, Reuter and Miller 2000, Coats and Goldman 2001, Rowe et al. 2002,
Simon et al. 2003, Lahontan RWQCB and UCD 2005, Simon 2006, California Water Boards and NDEP 2007).
The increase in sediment and nutrient load is a direct result of increased urbanization in the Tahoe Basin.
The Upper Truckee River, which drains the largest watershed in the Tahoe Basin, has been substantially altered
by land practices during the past 150 years. Throughout its watershed, the river has experienced ecological
degradation typical of what has occurred elsewhere in the Basin. It has been modified from its original conditions
by human activities, such as logging, livestock grazing, roads, gravel mining, fire suppression, golf courses, an
airport, and residential, commercial, and industrial developments. In many locations the channel was straightened
and enlarged, native vegetation was replaced by turf, and untreated stormwater was directed into the river and its
tributaries. The channel has incised and is experiencing accelerated rates of bed and bank erosion. These human
influences have resulted in reduced habitat quality for plant, wildlife, and fish species in the watershed and
increased sediment and nutrient loads discharging into Lake Tahoe from the river, contributing to the declining
clarity of the lake.
Past physical changes to the lower reach of the Upper Truckee River have affected the river’s stability, the
condition of the wetlands within its floodplain, and the quality of the water it carries into Lake Tahoe. Historical
grazing, dredging, log running, and other evidence indicate that the first alterations occurred in the 1800s. With
the construction of the Tahoe Keys development beginning in 1959, the river was channelized and relocated west
of its original course to its current location, and fill was placed in much of the wetland up to six feet above the
natural grade. Over time, the river became deeply incised, effectively eliminating a large portion of the Upper
Truckee River’s floodplain. These alterations have likely affected water quality by disconnecting the river from its
wetlands and floodplains, where sediment and nutrients can be removed from streamflows and runoff. Nutrients,
such as nitrogen and phosphorus, can be removed by plant uptake and volatilized by denitrification under certain
(anaerobic) conditions found in wetlands. The nutrients are converted to gaseous or organic forms, fixed into the
soil, or simply stored within the soil solution. Wetlands and floodplains also remove sediment and other
suspended particles by allowing sediment-laden water to pass through densely vegetated floodplains and
wetlands. Thus, the water quality of the lake can be protected and improved by restoring the natural functions of
wetlands and floodplains in watersheds draining to Lake Tahoe.
The preservation and restoration of riparian areas and wetlands of the Upper Truckee Marsh is important for
wildlife. In semiarid regions like the Tahoe Basin, the availability of moisture and cool, shaded microclimates
gives wetlands and riparian areas an importance for wildlife that is disproportionate to their areal extent.
Unfortunately, in the Tahoe Basin, most wetlands have been filled and developed, which has adversely affected
native vegetation, wildlife, and water quality.
The Upper Truckee Marsh is the largest remaining wetland area in the Tahoe Basin. It is one of five marshes in
the basin designated as an Ecologically Sensitive Area; the marsh’s size, uniqueness, and potential for supporting

high levels of biodiversity are the factors underlying this designation (Murphy and Knopp 2000). Although still
ecologically important, wetland habitats in the study area have been degraded by the channelization and
subsequent incision of the Upper Truckee River.
Within the study area, there is also the need to provide public access for recreation purposes. The Conservancy
acquired the parcels that make up the Upper Truckee Marsh study area to protect the existing ecological values of
the site and restore the natural processes and functions of the Upper Truckee River, Trout Creek, and associated
wetlands while providing public access for recreation purposes. However, certain parcels that make up the study
area were acquired in a litigation settlement (People of the State of California vs. Dillingham Development
Company and TRPA, CIV-S-85-0873-EJG [February 25, 1988]). The settlement requires that the Conservancy
provide public access to the beach area west of the existing Upper Truckee River mouth. The purpose of this
project is to restore natural geomorphic processes and ecological functions in this lowest reach of the Upper
Truckee River and the surrounding marsh to improve ecological values of the study area and help reduce the
river’s discharge of nutrients and sediment that diminish Lake Tahoe’s clarity while still providing public access,
access to vistas, and environmental education to the public where appropriate. This purpose includes improving
habitat values in the study area. Its implementation is an important component of the integrated objectives of the
Conservancy, Reclamation, and TRPA to improve environmental quality in the Lake Tahoe region.

1.3.2

CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT

According to the State CEQA Guidelines (14 CCR Section 15064[f][1]), preparation of an EIR is required
whenever a project may result in a significant impact on the physical environment. An EIR is an informational
document used to inform public agency decision makers and the general public of the significant environmental
effects of a project, identify feasible ways to minimize or mitigate the significant effects, and describe reasonable
alternatives to the project that could feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project while substantially
lessening or avoiding any of the significant or potentially significant environmental impacts.
CEQA requires that state and local government agencies consider the environmental effects of projects over
which they have discretionary authority before taking action on those projects (PRC Section 21000 et seq.).
CEQA also requires that each public agency avoid or fully reduce to less-than-significant levels, wherever
feasible, the significant environmental effects of projects it approves or implements. If a project would result in
significant and unavoidable environmental impacts that cannot be feasibly reduced to less-than-significant levels,
the project can still be approved, but the lead agency must consider and adopt a “statement of overriding
considerations” pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Sections 15043 and 15093. Although the primary purpose of
CEQA is to fully inform the decision makers and the public about the environmental effects of a proposed project
and to identify feasible mitigation measures and alternatives to reduce adverse effects to less-than-significant
levels, CEQA nonetheless allows an agency to approve a project even when not all significant adverse impacts
can be avoided or reduced to less-than-significant levels. However, that agency must explain and justify its
decision to approve such a project through the Statement of Overriding Considerations, setting forth the proposed
project’s general social, economic, policy, or other public benefits that support the agency’s informed decision to
approve the proposed project.

1.4.2

NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT

NEPA provides an interdisciplinary framework for federal agencies to develop information that will help them to
take environmental factors into account in their decision making (42 USC 4321, 40 CFR 1500.1). According to
NEPA, an EIS is required whenever a proposed major federal action (e.g., a proposal for legislation or an activity
financed, assisted, conducted, or approved by a federal agency) would significantly affect the human
environment.
The project has received federal funding for planning purposes and may receive funding from Reclamation for
construction; the project therefore requires the preparation of an EIS. It also requires the preparation of an EIS
because its development would require federal permits for one or more of the following activities: discharges of
fill material into waters of the United States, which is an activity regulated under Section 404 of the Clean Water
Act, and activities affecting plant or animal species protected by the Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) (16
USC 1531 et seq.).
An EIS is an informational document used by federal agencies in making decisions. An EIS is intended to provide
full and open disclosure of environmental consequences before agency action; an interdisciplinary approach to
project evaluation; objective consideration of reasonable alternatives; application of measures to avoid or reduce
adverse impacts; and an avenue for public and agency participation in decision making (40 CFR 1502.1). NEPA
defines mitigation as avoiding, minimizing, rectifying, reducing, or compensating for significant effects of the
proposed action (40 CFR 1508.20).
NEPA requires that a lead agency “include (in an EIS) appropriate mitigation measures not already included in
the proposed action or alternatives” (40 CFR 1502.14[f]). An EIS shall also include discussions of “means to
mitigate adverse environmental impacts (if not fully covered under Section 1502.14[f]).” In preparing a record of
decision under 40 CFR 1505.2, a lead agency is required to “[s]tate whether all practicable means to avoid or
minimize environmental harm from the alternative selected have been adopted, and if not, why they were not.

TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING COMPACT AND THE TRPA CODE OF
ORDINANCES

TRPA is the primary permitting agency and the lead agency under the Compact. TRPA is a bi-state regional
planning agency created in 1969 by federal law to oversee development on both the California and Nevada sides
of Lake Tahoe. Under the Compact, Code of Ordinances, and Rules of Procedure, an EIS is an informational
document used in the planning and decision-making process for a proposed project. The purpose of this
DEIR/DEIS/DEIS is not to recommend either approval or denial of the project, but to disclose objective
information that can be used in the development of a preferred alternative to the project/action for evaluation in
the EIR/EIS/EIS.
Article VII of the Compact presents important TRPA policies relevant to the preparation and use of an EIS. Key
provisions of the article are presented below:
►

►

►

►

Article VII(a)(2) states that when acting upon matters that have a significant effect on the environment, TRPA
shall “prepare and consider a detailed environmental impact statement before deciding to approve or carry out
any project.”
Article VII(a)(3) states that the EIS shall “study, develop and describe appropriate alternatives to
recommended courses of action for any project which involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative
uses of available resources.”
Article VII(a)(4) requires that TRPA “make available to states, counties, municipalities, institutions and
individuals, advice and information useful in restoring, maintaining and enhancing the quality of the region’s
environment.”
Article VII(a)(5) requires TRPA to “initiate and utilize ecological information in the planning and
development of resource-oriented projects.”

Chapter 3 of the Code of Ordinances provides direction regarding the TRPA environmental documentation.
Section 3.7 describes the approach and contents of an EIS. Article VI of the Rules of Procedure, Environmental
Impact Statements, provides guidance on the procedural steps necessary for conducting environmental review
consistent with Article VII of the Compact and Chapter 3 of the Code.

1.5

SCOPE AND FOCUS OF THE EIR/EIS/EIS

Pursuant to CEQA and NEPA, the discussion of potential effects on the environment is focused on those impacts
that the lead agencies have determined may be potentially significant. Pursuant to the TRPA Code of Ordinances,
the discussion is focused on any effects on attainment of environmental threshold carrying capacities of the Lake
Tahoe Regional Plan. (CEQA, NEPA, and TRPA allow a lead agency to limit a discussion of the environmental
effects in an EIR/EIS/EIS when the effects are not considered potentially significant.)
On October 3, 2006, the Conservancy and TRPA issued an NOP (Appendix A) to inform agencies and the general
public that a joint DEIR/DEIS/DEIS was being prepared. The Conservancy and TRPA invited comments on the
scope and content of the document and participation at a public scoping meeting. The NOP was published by the
California and Nevada State Clearinghouses and distributed to federal agencies, responsible and trustee agencies,
interested parties and organizations, and affected property owners (within 300 feet of the study area boundaries).
It was also posted on the internet (at http://edaw.net/site/default/defHome.aspx; currently, project information is
available at http://tahoe.ca.gov/upper-truckee-marsh-69.aspx). The NOP was circulated for 30 days as mandated

by CEQA. A specific circulation period is not defined in the TRPA Code of Ordinances, but the 30-day period is
a regular practice for TRPA EISs.
Reclamation issued a notice of intent (NOI) (Appendix A) to inform agencies and the general public that a joint
DEIR/DEIS/DEIS was being prepared and invited comments on the scope and content of the EIS. The NOI was
published in the Federal Register, Vol. 71, No. 202, on October 19, 2006. The NOI was also posted on the Upper
Truckee River and Marsh Restoration website. At that time Reclamation announced that a public involvement
program had been developed allowing opportunities for public participation and involvement in the NEPA
process. The NOI also provided information on the dates and times of public scoping meetings. There is no
mandated time limit for receiving written comments in response to the NOI under NEPA.
The Conservancy, Reclamation, and TRPA jointly held public scoping meetings on October 24, 2006, at 12:00
and 6:00 p.m. They also jointly presented the project at a TRPA Advisory Planning Commission meeting on
October 11, 2006, and a TRPA Governing Board meeting on October 25, 2006, to solicit input from the
community and public agencies to be considered in project design, alternatives selection, and on the scope and
content of the DEIR/DEIS/DEIS.
Chapter 5, “Compliance, Consultation, and Coordination,” summarizes the substantive comments on the NOP and
NOI. Copies of the comment letters are provided in the project’s Scoping Report (Appendix B).
This DEIR/DEIS/DEIS includes an evaluation of 17 environmental issue areas and other NEPA- and CEQAmandated topics. The 17 environmental issue areas are:
►
►
►
►
►
►
►
►

The Compact, PL 96-551, as revised in 1980, authorizes TRPA to adopt environmental quality standards, called
“environmental threshold carrying capacities” (thresholds), and to enforce ordinances designed to achieve the
thresholds, which were adopted by the TRPA Governing Board in 1982. This DEIR/DEIS/DEIS also includes an

AGENCY ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
LEAD AGENCIES

The Conservancy is the project sponsor and lead agency under CEQA. It is an independent agency within the
Natural Resources Agency of the State of California. It was established in its present form by state law in 1984
(Chapter 1239, Statutes of 1984). The Conservancy was established to develop and implement programs through
acquisitions, grants, and site improvements. The Conservancy’s mission is to preserve, protect, restore, enhance,
and sustain the unique and significant natural resources and recreational opportunities of the Tahoe Basin. Its
primary objectives are:
(1) to protect the natural environment of the basin, with priority placed on preserving the exceptional clarity and
quality of the waters of Lake Tahoe;
(2) to preserve and enhance the broad diversity of wildlife habitat in the Tahoe Basin; and
(3) to increase public access and recreation opportunities for visitors to the lake and other natural areas.
CEQA requires lead agencies to consider physical environmental effects that may occur with approval of a project
and to avoid or substantially lessen significant effects on the environment when feasible. When a project may
have a significant effect on the environment, the agency with primary responsibility for carrying out or approving
the project (the lead agency) is required to prepare an EIR.

1.6.2

TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY

TRPA is the primary permitting agency in the Basin and the lead agency under the Compact. The project must
comply with the Code of Ordinances to receive permits for construction. TRPA permitting requirements include
the EIP Permit, Land Capability and Coverage Verifications, and Historic Determination. TRPA is a bi-state
regional planning agency created in 1969 by Federal law to oversee development on both the California and
Nevada sides of Lake Tahoe. TRPA’s mission is to “lead the cooperative effort to preserve, restore, and enhance
the unique natural and human environment of the Lake Tahoe Region.” Section 1.4.3 details the key provisions of
Article VII of the Compact, which presents important TRPA policies relevant to the use of an EIS.
In addition, in accordance with the Code of Ordinances, TRPA may not approve a project if any of the nine TRPA
thresholds would be exceeded. If a project would exceed an identified threshold, mitigation must be imposed to
reduce the impact and maintain the threshold. Under Chapter 4 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances, findings must
be made in writing regarding all significant environmental impacts and their associated mitigation measures, with
substantial evidence provided in the record of review before final project approval.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, BUREAU OF RECLAMATION

Reclamation is the lead agency under NEPA. This DEIR/DEIS/DEIS has been prepared in accordance with
NEPA (42 USC 4321 et seq.), CEQ’s Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR
Parts 1500–1508), and the Department of Interior’s Departmental Manual 516 DM 1-7, 14. Reclamation is a
federal agency created in 1902 to provide water for 17 western states. Reclamation’s mission is “to manage,
develop, and protect water and related resources in an environmentally and economically sound manner in the
interest of the American Public..”
NEPA requires federal agencies to consider environmental effects that include, among others, impacts on social,
cultural, and natural resources. When a proposed action may have a significant effect on the environment, the
federal agency with primary responsibility for carrying out or approving the action (the lead agency) is required to
prepare an EIS.

1.6.4

TRUSTEE, RESPONSIBLE, AND COOPERATING AGENCIES

Under CEQA, a trustee agency is a state agency that has jurisdiction by law over natural resources that are held in
trust for the people of the State of California. Two trustee agencies, the California Department of Fish and Game
and the California State Lands Commission, meet that definition with respect to resources potentially affected by
the project.
Under CEQA, a responsible agency is a public agency other than the lead agency that has legal responsibility for
carrying out or approving a project or elements of a project (PRC Section 21069). Under NEPA, a cooperating
agency is any other federal agency that has jurisdiction by law, or other federal agency that has special expertise
with respect to any environmental impact involved in an action. A federal agency becomes a cooperating agency
by agreement with the NEPA lead agency and is involved in helping to develop the EIS. Several agencies other
than the Conservancy, Reclamation, and TRPA have jurisdiction over the implementation of the elements of the
project, as identified below.

The cover sheet identifies lead and any other involved agencies; contact information for the lead agencies;
contact persons; the title of the project and its location; a brief description of the project; a brief abstract; and
comment submission information.
“Summary” presents an overview of the project and alternatives and associated environmental
impacts/consequences; a listing of environmental impacts/consequences and mitigation measures; and impact
conclusions regarding known areas of controversy and issues to be resolved.
Chapter 1, “Introduction and Statement of Purpose and Need,” explains the CEQA, NEPA, and TRPA
processes; lists the lead, cooperating, responsible, and trustee agencies that may have discretionary authority
over the project; specifies the underlying purpose and need, and project objectives to which the lead agencies
are responding in considering the alternatives; outlines the organization of the document; and provides
information on public participation.
Chapter 2, “Project Alternatives,” presents the alternatives. This chapter constitutes the alternatives
description and describes the characteristics, components, supporting on- and off-site infrastructure, and
alternatives considered but eliminated from further evaluation.
Chapter 3, “Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences,” is divided into 17 sections by topic.
Each section describes the affected environment (i.e., regulatory setting and environmental setting), presents
the methodology and assumptions used in the environmental analysis, and defines the types of environmental
effects. This information is followed by an analysis of direct and indirect impacts at an equal level of detail
for all alternatives, including the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, and feasible mitigation measures that
would avoid or eliminate significant adverse impacts or reduce them to less-than-significant levels, where
feasible. Sections 3.1 through 3.9 are presented in Volume 1.

PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

OVERVIEW

This chapter describes a range of reasonable alternatives that would meet the purpose, need, and project objectives
for the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project (project). This range of reasonable alternatives complies
with the requirements of Title 14, Section 15126.6 of the California Code of Regulations (14 CCR 15126.6), also
referred to as the State CEQA Guidelines; Title 40, Section 1502 of the Code of Federal Regulations (i.e., 40 CFR
1502); Article VII(a)(3) of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) Compact; and Section 5.8.B of the
TRPA Code of Ordinances. Each of these alternatives is feasible, based on relevant economic, environmental,
social, technological, and legal factors, although they provide different advantages and disadvantages related to
environmental impacts and achievement of the project’s purpose, need, and project objectives.
More specifically, this chapter discusses the development of reasonable alternatives; lists those alternatives and
project elements considered but eliminated from further evaluation; and describes the elements of the four
restoration (action) alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) and the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5),
which are analyzed at a comparable level of detail as required by the Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ)
regulations for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (i.e., 40 CFR 1502.14). The chapter
subsequently describes the resource management and monitoring, construction, and environmental commitments
applicable to the alternatives.
Each of the five alternatives evaluated in this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS was named for its approach to restoration of the
Upper Truckee River and the associated level of public access and recreation infrastructure:
►
►
►
►
►

Alternative 1: Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
Alternative 2: New Channel-West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure)
Alternative 3: Middle Marsh Corridor (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
Alternative 4: Inset Floodplain (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
Alternative 5: No-Project/No-Action

Alternatives 1–4 are all intended to meet the basic project objectives, but differ in river restoration treatments and
recreation infrastructure that would alter public access (Exhibits 2-1 through 2-4). The differences among
alternatives will assist public decision makers in selecting the alternative that best meets the project objectives as
well as the needs of the community and the environment. The types of elements included in Alternatives 1–4 are
listed in Table 2-1, briefly described in the following paragraphs, and their locations are displayed in Exhibits 2-1
through 2-4. The elements of the alternatives are subsequently described in greater detail in Section 2.3,
“Elements of the Alternatives.”
►

Alternative 1. Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure). To restore
the river channel and its connection to the floodplain, Alternative 1 would increase channel length and
decrease channel capacity. A key element of this restoration would be the use of engineering elements
(primarily structures in the channel) to cause sediment deposition that raises the channel bed and decreases
channel capacity and slightly reduces the capacity of the channel mouth at Lake Tahoe. Alternative 1 would
also restore a naturally-functioning lagoon in the vicinity of the existing Sailing Lagoon, lagoon and wet
meadow conditions behind the east end of Barton Beach, floodplain functions at the Tahoe Keys Property
Owners Association (TKPOA) Corporation Yard (contingent on TKPOA consent), and sand ridges (“dunes”)
at Cove East Beach. Alternative 1 would enhance forest habitat and an area of “core habitat” that contains
sensitive marsh in the center of the study area by removing or relocating volunteer (i.e., user-created) trails. In
addition, at the existing location where boaters enter and exit the Upper Truckee River, adjacent to East
Venice Drive, the river bank would be stabilized with best management practices (BMPs) to avoid erosion
and other resource damage.

Under Alternatives 1–4, recreation infrastructure is proposed near the perimeter of the study area. Alternative
1 provides a potential “maximum” level of recreation infrastructure that includes parking on the west side of
the study area adjacent to the Tahoe Keys Marina, a connected system of bicycle paths, boardwalks,
observation areas, two kiosks, and signage. Bicycle paths would be Class I/Shared-Use Paths (as described in
TRPA and TMPO 2010). Bridges over Trout Creek and the Upper Truckee River (and a boardwalk) would
connect the proposed bicycle paths. Bicycle paths would connect to existing regional trails near the study
area.
►

Alternative 2. New Channel-West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure). To restore the river
channel and its connection to the floodplain, Alternative 2 would directly raise the streambed elevation,
increase the channel length, and decrease channel capacity. A key element of this restoration would be the
excavation of a new river channel that has less capacity than the existing channel. The existing river mouth
would be replaced with a new smaller river mouth, similar in size to the historical river mouth prior to
dredging. Unlike Alternative 1, the river channel and floodplain restoration elements of Alternative 2 would
require two existing stormwater discharge locations to be modified and/or relocated. Alternative 2 also
includes all of the other restoration and enhancement elements of Alternative 1. In addition, at the existing
location where boaters enter and exit the Upper Truckee River, adjacent to East Venice Drive, the river bank
would be stabilized with BMPs to avoid erosion and other resource damage. To protect natural resources, a
boardwalk connecting the river to East Venice Drive would be constructed.
Alternative 2 would provide a “minimum” level of recreation infrastructure that includes a modified
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)-accessible pedestrian trail to Cove East Beach, five viewpoints, a
fishing platform, and signage. Except for four viewpoints along the eastern perimeter of the study area
(adjacent to the Al Tahoe neighborhood), this infrastructure is located from East Venice Drive to Cove East
Beach.

►

Alternative 3. Middle Marsh Corridor (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure). To restore the river
channel and its connection to the floodplain, Alternative 3 would promote the development through natural
processes of a new main channel and/or distributary channels in the central portion of the study area. A
“pilot” channel, similar to the channel segments constructed under Alternatives 1 and 2, would be constructed
from the existing river channel to historical channels in the center of the study area, but no construction would
occur in the central or northern portions of the study area. Rather, natural processes would be allowed to
dictate the flow path(s), bed and bank elevations, and capacities of the channel(s) through the central and
northern portions of the study area. The existing river mouth would be retained, but its capacity would be
reduced. In addition, by boring two culverts under U.S. 50, an area of isolated floodplain would be
reactivated. The river channel and floodplain restoration elements of Alternative 3 would require two existing
stormwater discharge locations to be modified and/or relocated. Also, like Alternatives 1 and 2, Alternative 3
would restore a natural-functioning lagoon in the vicinity of the Sailing Lagoon and floodplain functions at
the TKPOA Corporation Yard and would enhance areas of “core habitat” and forest. However, Alternative 3
would not restore lagoon and wet meadow conditions behind the east end of Barton Beach (by removal of
existing fill) or dunes at Cove East Beach.
Alternative 3 would provide a “moderate” level of recreation infrastructure that includes three pedestrian
trails, a bicycle path, a kiosk, one observation area, six viewpoints, a fishing platform, and signage at multiple
locations. Similar to Alternative 2, the modified pedestrian trail to Cove East Beach would be ADAaccessible, as well as the fishing platform at the restored lagoon. Alternative 3 would also include a bicycle
path and a pedestrian trail near the Highland Woods neighborhood, connected to Mackinaw Road, and a
pedestrian trail adjacent to the Al Tahoe neighborhood, from Capistrano Avenue to East Barton Beach, two
segments of which would be boardwalks.

►

Alternative 4. Inset Floodplain (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure). To restore the river channel and its
connection to the floodplain, Alternative 4 would lower bank heights by excavating an inset floodplain along

California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Project Alternatives

much of the river channel and by localized cutting and filling to create meanders in the existing straightened
reach. The existing river mouth would be retained, and its capacity would not be reduced. Although
Alternative 4 would include the enhancement of core and forest habitats, it would not include the restoration
of floodplain functions at the TKPOA Corporation Yard, a natural-functioning lagoon in the vicinity of the
existing Sailing Lagoon, or dunes at Cove East Beach. In addition, at the existing location where boaters enter
and exit the Upper Truckee River, adjacent to East Venice Drive, the river bank would be stabilized with
BMPs to avoid erosion and other resource damage.
Similar to Alternative 3, Alternative 4 would provide a “moderate” level of recreation infrastructure that
includes two pedestrian trails, a bicycle path, a kiosk, two observation areas, five viewpoints, and signage at
multiple locations. The bicycle path would be adjacent to the Highland Woods neighborhood, connected to
Mackinaw Road, and the pedestrian trails would be near the Tahoe Keys, from East Venice Drive to Cove
East Beach, in part replacing the existing pedestrian trail, and adjacent to the Al Tahoe neighborhood, from
Capistrano Avenue to San Francisco Avenue, one segment of which would be a boardwalk.
►

Alternative 5. No Project/No Action. Alternative 5 would not provide any actions to restore the river channel
and its connection to the floodplain in the study area. This alternative would allow but not facilitate the longterm, passive recovery of the river system via natural processes. The existing river mouth location, size, and bed
elevation would continue to adjust to lake levels, streamflows, and sediment loads. The Upper Truckee River–
lagoon connection would not be restored, leaving the direct open-water connection between the Tahoe Keys
Marina channel, the Sailing Lagoon, and Lake Tahoe unchanged. The previously leveled area between Cove
East Beach and the Sailing Lagoon would not be modified. Alternative 5 would not protect an extensive area of
core habitat. However, the Conservancy has been implementing localized decommissioning of some trails, and
similar actions would likely continue to be implemented.
Alternative 5 would not take any direct steps to construct recreation infrastructure elements that alter public
access. However, this alternative would likely maintain existing infrastructure and might result in the
construction of some additional, smaller elements (e.g., signage).

None of the alternatives are designated as preferred at this time; rather, the lead agencies will identify a preferred
alternative after taking into consideration public comment on this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS. The preferred alternative
may be one of the five alternatives or a combination of components from these concept plans, assembled into a
different variation within the general scope of the range of alternatives.
This chapter presents Alternatives 1–4 at the 30 percent (conceptual) design level, which constitutes a “project­
level” analysis. The descriptions include information on the design concept and design elements, modifications to
existing facilities and/or new facilities that would be required, the anticipated activities and equipment needed to
construct each alternative, and likely operational scenarios.
The description of Alternative 5 (the No-Project/No-Action Alternative) includes existing conditions at the time
environmental analysis commenced (i.e., in October 2006, when the CEQA notice of preparation [TRPA and
Conservancy 2006] was released) and as required by NEPA conditions expected to occur in the foreseeable future
if the project does not occur, based on ongoing physical and ecological processes, current plans, current resource
management practices, and existing infrastructure and community services. For most resource issues, existing and
foreseeable future conditions are anticipated to be effectively the same. For future conditions anticipated to differ
from existing conditions, impacts relative to existing and future conditions are discussed separately.

ALTERNATIVES DEVELOPMENT
GUIDING PRINCIPLES

Principles that guided the development of these alternatives included:
►

Fulfillment of all project objectives and design directives. Each alternative was designed to be a “fullspectrum” alternative that addressed, to varying degrees, all project objectives and design directives.

►

Use of modular elements. Many but not all of the elements in each alternative were modular, and thus could
be included in other alternatives.

►

Embodiment of diverse concepts. The alternatives embody a diverse range of concepts for particular
components of the restoration plan.

►

Potential feasibility and implementable approach. Each alternative is intended to be a potentially feasible
and implementable approach; none is a “straw” (i.e., intentionally infeasible) alternative.

►

Critical environmental constraints. Alternatives were developed within bounds set by various critical
constraints, identified and mapped early in the planning process (Conservancy and DGS 2003). This initial
information about critical environmental impact issues and the relationship of the alternatives to TRPA
thresholds was incorporated.

►

Conformance to land use regulations and purposes of property acquisitions. All alternatives were
developed within the context of existing land use regulations and stated California Tahoe Conservancy
(Conservancy) purposes for acquiring properties.

►

Minimal maintenance. The public access and recreational facility design elements of the alternatives were
developed to minimize the need for future maintenance within the study area.

2.2.2

ALTERNATIVES AND ALTERNATIVE ELEMENTS CONSIDERED BUT ELIMINATED
FROM FURTHER EVALUATION

Alternative locations were considered but eliminated from further evaluation because off-site alternatives would
not fulfill the purpose and primary objectives of the project. An important part of the project’s purpose and
objectives is to restore natural geomorphic processes and ecological functions to improve ecological values of the
study area and help reduce the river’s discharge of nutrients and sediment that diminish Lake Tahoe’s clarity,
while still providing safe access to vistas and environmental education to the public. Off-site actions upstream
along the Upper Truckee River or elsewhere in the watershed could reduce the river’s discharge of nutrients and
sediment, but would not substantially improve ecological values of the study area.
While the four preliminary conceptual alternatives were being developed and refined, several facilities were
removed from the alternatives, in particular a full-service visitor center and restrooms. As described further
below, these facilities were determined to be inconsistent with the project objectives and the principles for
alternative development given above.
Initial conceptual plans for Alternative 1 included a full-service visitor center located near the end of East Venice
Drive. This facility was included to ensure that the maximum amount of recreational infrastructure that would be
feasible was considered; however, the visitor center was determined to be unnecessary and incompatible with the
site and, therefore, was removed from the alternative.

California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

2-13

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Project Alternatives

The need for visitor centers on the south shore of Lake Tahoe has been largely met by the Taylor Creek Visitor
Center, the Meyers Visitor Center, and the Explore Tahoe Visitor Center. Creating a full-service visitor center on
the project site would be an unnecessary duplication of services provided in multiple nearby locations. In
addition, the infrastructure required to support the visitor center would be inconsistent with the limitations of the
site. The full-service visitor center would require substantial operations and maintenance costs, which would
place an ongoing financial burden on the State while providing services that are duplicated elsewhere.
The full-service visitor center also was determined to be inconsistent with the scale and type of use of the site and of
the study area as a whole. The site is located adjacent to a residential neighborhood, has a small beach area, and is
generally used for dispersed recreation. The visitor center had the potential to attract an increased number of users
seeking an interior interpretive experience. The resulting type and amount of use could negatively affect the existing
dispersed uses, which are more compatible with the size and setting of the site in the study area. Therefore, the fullservice visitor center has been replaced with a kiosk that is compatible with the size and setting of the study area.
Initial conceptual plans for Alternatives 1, 3, and 4 also included restrooms at the full-service visitor center and at
Cove East Beach. However, refinement of the alternatives reduced the need for these facilities, and it was
determined that the reduced need would be met by the restrooms at the Tahoe Keys Marina. In part, the restroom
facilities were intended to support the full-service visitor center, which has been removed from the alternatives.

2.3

ELEMENTS OF THE ALTERNATIVES

This section describes the (1) river restoration, (2) terrestrial habitat restoration and enhancement, and (3) public
access and recreation elements of each alternative. For each of these three categories, the section first summarizes
the elements common to multiple action alternatives, and then describes the elements or physical characteristics
specific to each alternative. Additional information regarding the alternatives is provided in the appendices:
Appendix C, “Schematic Plans,” provides additional detail about the elements of each project alternative;
Appendix D, “Construction Workers and Equipment for Action Alternatives,” lists the construction workers and
equipment associated with specific construction activities; and Appendix E, “Alternative Cost Estimates,”
provides cost estimates of the elements and the total cost of Alternatives 1–4 (which were prepared in 2006 for the
Upper Truckee River and Wetland Restoration Project Final Concept Plan Report).

2.3.1

RIVER RESTORATION ELEMENTS

The primary objective of river restoration in Alternatives 1–4 is to decrease channel capacity and reestablish the
channel’s connection to an active floodplain with more frequent overbanking of river flow into adjacent marsh
and wet meadow. The active floodplain is defined as the area inundated by streamflow events that occur at least
once every couple of years (i.e., two- to five-year storm events). For the Upper Truckee River in the study area,
two- to five-year storm events correspond to a river flow of 760–1,660 cubic feet per second (cfs).
The Upper Truckee River downstream of the U.S. 50 bridge is incised and overly wide as a result of direct and
indirect human disturbances. Consequently, the channel can convey, on average, at least 800–1,000 cfs without
streamflows overbanking into the meadow. This channel capacity is more than double the geomorphic channelforming flow, approximately 450 cfs, and most of the former (i.e., predisturbance) floodplain has become an
infrequently inundated terrace.
Reestablishing an active floodplain and reducing channel capacity would increase the frequency and duration of
overbank flows, and thus, the deposition of suspended sediment on the meadow. These restored river processes
would in turn enhance plant communities, aquatic and terrestrial habitat, groundwater recharge, water quality, and
the ecological and aesthetic values of the study area.

Project Alternatives

2-14

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

Alternatives 1–4 each would reduce the channel capacity and reestablish an active floodplain connection, but by
various means. In general, the proposed actions would reduce the width of the channel, decrease the elevation
difference between the channel bed and floodplain surface, or do both.
Alternatives 1–4 share several common river restoration elements:
►

stabilization of the banks downstream of the U.S. 50 bridge to reduce sediment inputs;

►

restoration of the river channel to reestablish an active floodplain connection with the river and to replace the
straightened and enlarged channel adjacent to the Lower West Side (LWS) Restoration Area with a more
sinuous, geomorphically-sized channel;

►

reactivation of an existing secondary channel to increase floodplain connection with the river;

►

modification of the previously dredged river mouth to limit backwater effects from Lake Tahoe;

►

lowering of portions of the floodplain to reestablish an active floodplain connection with the river; and

►

removal of existing artificial fill from the floodplain to increase the area providing floodplain functions.

Some river restoration elements, however, are not shared by all alternatives:
►

fill of channel segments abandoned as a result of channel restoration to increase the area providing floodplain
functions (Alternatives 1, 2, and 3);

►

reactivation of a floodplain terrace to increase the area providing floodplain functions (Alternative 3);

►

modification of existing stormwater discharge locations to allow for river and flood plain restoration elements
(Alternatives 2 and 3);

►

reestablishment of a river-overflow lagoon (Alternatives 1–3);

►

removal of fill from behind the east end of Barton Beach to create additional lagoon and wet meadow
conditions (Alternatives 1 and 2); and

►

stabilization of river bank adjacent to East Venice Drive to protect natural resources from boaters entering and
exiting the Upper Truckee River (Alternatives 1, 2, and 4).

In the design of all of these river restoration elements, the potential effects on flood hazards were considered.
The specific design of the river restoration elements of each alternative and the consideration of flood hazards are
described further in the tables and sections below. Table 2-2 provides representative descriptions of the
engineered elements that are incorporated into the alternatives, Table 2-3 summarizes the specific elements of
each alternative, and the sections below describe the elements in greater detail.

STABILIZATION OF ERODING BANKS DOWNSTREAM OF THE U.S. 50 BRIDGE
Flow constriction and redirection under the U.S. 50 bridge create large hydraulic stresses on the steep and high
streambanks downstream. This has accelerated the rates of bank erosion and fine-sediment delivery to the Upper
Truckee River and ultimately to Lake Tahoe. With the willing cooperation of relevant private landowners, all of
the alternatives would construct permanent bank protection on the east bank downstream of the bridge, using
geotechnical methods, bioengineering methods, or both.

Vertical grade-control structures would be constructed of a combination of large boulders, cobbles, small rock, and
logs to hydraulically hold the bed elevation required by the geomorphic design. In some cases, the vertical grade
controls would be designed to promote net deposition (aggradation) of bed material, while in other cases they
would be designed only to prevent net erosion (degradation) of the bed. The structures would be keyed into
streambanks, and the disturbed streambanks would be bioengineered with vegetation.

Lateral Grade Control

Lateral grade-control structures would be constructed of a combination of large boulders, cobbles, small rock, and

Bank protection would be constructed with large boulders at the toe (approximately RS 0+00 to RS 13+00), and
bioengineered vegetation treatment to hydraulically protect the banks from stream erosion. The protection would
be designed to prevent continued side-slope erosion on the high, steep east bank.

New Channel

Length (feet)
A new channel would be constructed by excavating one into the existing meadow terrace to improve geomorphic
Area (square feet) function. Flows would overbank approximately every one to two years (at or above the design flow of ±450 cfs),
and the anticipated sediment load would be transported, and thus stability maintained. The bed topography would
be somewhat varied, ranging from riffle to pool features where appropriate. The bed material would be composed
of a combination of native material and placed clean cobbles, gravel, and sand. The banks of the new channel
would be bioengineered with combinations of salvaged/transplanted willows and sod blocks, willow mattresses,
and log revetments.

Recontoured Channel

Length (feet)
The recontoured channel would be constructed by local cut/fill and grading within the existing channel, to improve
Area (square feet) geomorphic function. The low-flow sinuosity would be increased, bed forms would be more diverse, bank angles
would be more varied, and bank materials would be strengthened by bioengineering. The existing bed elevation,
channel alignment, and high-flow channel capacity would not be modified.

East Venice Bank
Stabilization

Length (feet)
The river bank adjacent to East Venice Drive where boaters currently enter and exit the Upper Truckee River (RS
Area (square feet) 65+00) would be treated with BMPs such as rocks, boulders, logs, and signage in order to protect natural
resources. The stabilization would be designed to prevent continued soil erosion.

River Mouth Modification

Area (square feet) River mouth modification would consist of treatments to the river between the beach ridge and the lagoon
(approximately RS 100+00 to RS 95+00). Measures would vary, from bioengineering the banks for stabilization
and reduced capacity or constructing a vertical grade control with bioengineered margins, to constructing a new
channel at the mouth in a new location or placing piles to support a bridge at the existing location.

Representative Description
Floodplain Restoration

Area (square feet) The existing secondary channel would be activated to improve geomorphic function. Flows would be able to
access the existing secondary channel at or above the design flow of the proposed main channel, and hydraulic
stress on the main channel banks would be reduced. The existing secondary channel would be activated by locally
excavating the channel inlet and outlet to design elevations. Banks would be strengthened using bioengineering.

Complete Backfilling of
Old Channel

Length (feet)
Complete backfilling of the existing channel would involve placing fill in sections of existing channel (those that
Area (square feet) would be abandoned) up to the elevation of the adjacent terrace/floodplain. Some microtopography variations
would be maintained, and the geomorphic function would be similar to the function on the adjacent
terrace/floodplain (inundated only during large flood flows). Revegetation of the new surface would incorporate a
mixture of salvaged/transplanted sod and willow, willow wattles, and new plantings.

Partial Backfilling of Old
Channel

Length (feet)
Partial backfilling of the old channel would involve placing fill in sections of existing channel that would be
Area (square feet) abandoned up to an elevation about two to three feet lower than the adjacent terrace/floodplain, to allow
geomorphic function as a floodplain overflow channel during streamflows over the design flow of the proposed
main channel. The old channelcould be active every few to several years. Some microtopography variations would
be maintained on the new surface, but there would be a net flow direction and path to limit stagnant water after
flow events. Revegetation of the new surface would incorporate a mixture of salvaged/transplanted sod and
willow, willow wattles, and new plantings, and would have more resistant rock or log materials incorporated near
the inlet and outlet (adjacent specific vertical and/or lateral grade controls).

Lowered Floodplain

Area (square feet) Lowering the floodplain would involve excavating terraces between RS 0+00 and RS 29+00 to increase the
opportunity for overflow to inundate these isolated floodplain areas and decrease hydraulic stress on the main
channel banks. The excavation depth below existing ground would range from about one to three feet, depending
on the location. Revegetation of the lowered surface would incorporate a mixture of salvaged/transplanted sod and
willow, willow wattles, and new plantings.

Inset Floodplain

Area (square feet) Inset floodplain would involve excavation directly adjacent to the existing channel to establish an active floodplain
that would be inundated at or above the design flow of the proposed main channel and would reduce hydraulic
stress on the channel banks. The excavation depth below existing ground would average about three feet.
Revegetation of the lowered surface would incorporate a mixture of salvaged/transplanted sod and willow, willow
wattles, and new plantings.

Restored Floodplain

Area (square feet) Restored floodplain would involve excavation of existing (previously imported) fill to the approximate elevation of
native ground to improve the geomorphic function of these areas to be similar to adjacent floodplain. Revegetation of
the restored surface would incorporate a mixture of salvaged/transplanted sod and willow, willow wattles, and new
plantings.

Stormwater Treatment
Basin

Area (square feet) Stormwater treatment basins would be installed as needed to replace and improve the function of existing stormwater
pre-treatment outfalls or ditches in locations where the proposed channel would be relocated. The stormwater
treatment basins would be excavated in existing high ground and constructed of rock and vegetation to promote
sediment settling and infiltration.

Overflow Culverts

Length (feet)
Overflow culverts would be installed via boring under U.S. 50 between the main channel and the fill at the
Area (square feet) commercial development located immediately west of the U.S. 50 bridge at an elevation to improve flood flow
conveyance when water upstream of the bridge would be out of bank. This would improve geomorphic function by
activating the isolated floodplain downstream between U.S. 50 and RS 5+00 and decrease hydraulic stress on the
main channel banks.
Lagoon Restoration
Length (feet)

Restored Lagoon

Area (square feet) The restored lagoon would involve a combination of local excavation, fill removal, and recontouring in areas
previously dredged or filled to reestablish shallow lagoon area(s) behind the beach ridge and connected to the
stream channel(s). Salvaged soil and vegetation would be used, along with plantings, to revegetate using a mixture
of native plant species appropriate for the planned water depths.

2-18

Bulkhead and Levee

A bulkhead would be constructed of driven sheet pile on the Tahoe Keys Marina (west) side, with placement of an
earthen levee on the east side. The bulkhead would extend the existing sheet pile bulkhead across the existing
lagoon opening into the marina and be located approximately 30 feet to the east of the existing opening. An
earthen levee would be contoured to match the existing embankments on the north and south sides of the lagoon.
The levee would incorporate maintenance access along the crest, with remaining areas revegetated using a mixture
of woody and herbaceous species suited to the range of moisture conditions from lagoon edge to levee top.

Dune/Beach Restoration
Restored Dune

Area (square feet) The restored dune would involve excavation and recontouring, in the area between Cove East Beach and the Sailing
Lagoon that was previously leveled to reestablish depressions (swales) and dunes (ridges), with increased soil and
hydrologic diversity. Salvaged soil and vegetation would be used, along with plantings, to revegetate using a mixture
of woody and herbaceous species suited to the range of moisture conditions in the depressions and dunes.

Alt. 3: Overflow culverts would be constructed under U.S. 50 through the embankment fill
between the existing channel and the building pad fill of the commercial development
immediately west of the U.S. 50 bridge. The elevation of the culverts would be at or above the

isolated, pumped, and drained; sediment (including invasive plants and animals) would be
disposed off site; and the lagoon would be recontoured and revegetated with a mixture of
native plant species appropriate for the planned water depths.
Alts. 1–2 (additional): The existing imported fill at East Barton Beach would be excavated to
native ground elevations to restore a lagoon (approximately 18,000 square feet) and would be

Dune/Beach Restoration
Alts. 1–2: The previously cleared and leveled dunes or sand ridges (approximately 130,000

Under Alternatives 1–4, the streambanks immediately downstream of U.S. 50 (from River Station [RS] 0+00 to
RS 13+00) would be modified. The modifications would include keyed-in boulders at the base (toe) of the bank
and bioengineered revegetation above the boulders. Protection would be installed primarily on the high, actively
eroding east bank, but it would also include active existing and proposed cut bank sites on the west bank.
Additional protection against bank erosion would be achieved by reactivating the secondary channel from RS
5+25 to RS 11+00 and lowering the floodplain on the west bank from RS 0+00 to RS 11+00; both measures
would decrease hydraulic stress on the main channel banks during high streamflows.
Under Alternative 5, the streambanks immediately downstream of U.S. 50 would continue to erode and contribute
relatively large volumes of sediment per linear foot, particularly off the high side slope on the east bank.

RIVER CHANNEL RESTORATION
The straightened Upper Truckee River channel not only has excess capacity from dredging, but also has a uniform
channel bed morphology that is not diverse enough to support high-quality aquatic habitat. Alternatives 1, 2, and
4 would replace the existing straightened reach near the LWS Restoration Area with a more sinuous (i.e., more
curved and thus longer) channel.
The alternatives differ in the alignment of the new geomorphically-sized channel and improved active floodplain
connections to the existing meadow surfaces. Alternative 3 also differs from Alternatives 1, 2, and 4 because it
would not include construction of a complete new channel to Lake Tahoe. Alternative 3 would replace the
existing straightened reach by construction of a short pilot channel to redirect the river flow into the center of the
marsh, allowing natural processes to determine flow paths along the meadow surface (which has appropriate,
historical floodplain features) and promoting self-formation of a new channel or channels.
Alternative 1: Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
Alternative 1 proposes to improve the geomorphic function of the river channel and its connection to the
surrounding topography by raising the streambed elevation, increasing the channel length, and decreasing channel
capacity by a combination of engineering elements in various reaches. Alternative 1 would construct five vertical
grade-control structures with crest elevations above the existing bed, to promote bed aggradation within about
3,400 feet of the existing channel (from RS 29+00 to RS 63+00). Over time, bar development in the aggrading
reach would also contribute to channel narrowing and reduced capacity. Alternative 1 would directly reshape and
resize about 1,910 feet of existing secondary channel to become a geomorphically-sized main channel (about
38 feet wide and 4 feet deep) from approximately RS 14+00 to RS 29+00. Alternative 1 would also directly
excavate about 3,890 feet of new geomorphically-sized channel (about 38 feet wide and 4 feet deep) to replace the
straightened reach by the LWS Restoration Area (from RS 63+00 to RS 93+00). Existing woody vegetation
would be preserved wherever possible, to help provide erosion-resistant areas. The banks of the proposed main
channel would also be strengthened by bioengineered revegetation, using salvaged/transplanted willows and sod
blocks, willow mattresses, and, in some areas, log revetments.
The proposed main-channel alignment and profile for Alternative 1 are a combination of modified existing
reaches and wholly constructed reaches and would require additional engineered elements to stabilize the
proposed channel positions and/or size at transitions between treatments and/or intersections of the old and new
channels. These elements would include three vertical grade controls to stabilize the bed at existing elevations (at
RS 17+00, RS 29+00, and RS 93+00) and four lateral grade controls to hold the proposed streambank and channel
locations (at RS 17+00, RS 29+00, RS 63+00, and near RS 85+00). In general, the control structures would be
constructed of a combination of rock material and logs, with bioengineered revegetation above the future
waterline. The grade control at RS 93+00 would set the bed elevation for the reconnection between the river and
lagoon; therefore, it would be designed to simulate the appearance and function of resistant subsurface geologic
layers (e.g., consolidated lake sediments) that occur naturally in the study area.

No direct or indirect modifications to Trout Creek are proposed under Alternative 1.
Alternative 2: New Channel–West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure)
Alternative 2 would improve the geomorphic function of the river channel and its connection to the surrounding
topography by directly raising the streambed elevation, increasing the channel length, and decreasing channel
capacity. To achieve these objectives it proposes the construction of 8,420 feet of new, geomorphically-sized
channel (about 38 feet wide and 4 feet deep), to replace the existing channel from RS 20+00 to RS 95+50.
Existing woody vegetation in the areas to be disturbed, particularly along proposed finished streambank locations,
would be preserved wherever possible and used for erosion control. The banks of the proposed main channel
would also be strengthened by bioengineered revegetation, using salvaged/transplanted willows and sod blocks,
willow mattresses, and, in some areas, log revetments.
The alignment and profile of the main channel for Alternative 2 would consist primarily of constructed reaches,
with some transitions and/or intersections of old and new channels that would require additional engineered
elements to stabilize the channel positions and/or size. These elements would include two vertical grade controls
(at RS 21+00 and near RS 96+00) to stabilize the bed elevation, and four lateral grade controls (at RS 21+00, RS
38+00, RS 39+00, and RS 95+50) to hold the proposed streambank and channel location. In general, the control
structures would be constructed of a combination of rock material and logs, with bioengineered revegetation
above the future waterline. The grade control near RS 96+00 would set the bed elevation for the reconnection
between the river and lagoon; therefore, it would be designed to simulate the appearance and function of resistant
subsurface geologic layers (e.g., consolidated lake sediments) that occur naturally in the study area.
No direct or indirect modifications to the Trout Creek channel are proposed under Alternative 2.
Alternative 3: Middle Marsh Corridor (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
The geomorphic function of the river channel and its connection to the surrounding topography would be
improved by both active and passive restoration means. The active measures would raise the streambed elevation,
increase the channel length, and decrease channel capacity by constructing 1,500 feet of new, geomorphically­
sized channel (about 38 feet wide and 4 feet deep) downstream of RS 38+00 and reshaping about 1,500 feet of
existing secondary channel between RS 17+00 and RS 28+00 as a geomorphically-sized channel. The passive
restoration downstream of the pilot channel in the main marsh would replace about 7,100 feet of existing singlethread channel with a network of small channels of varied capacity. No construction would occur within the main
meadow channel sections. Therefore, the flow paths, bed and bank elevations, and channel capacities would be
dictated by natural processes.
The proposed main-channel alignment and profile for Alternative 3 would have a relatively short constructed
reach, with a couple of transitions and/or intersections of old and new channels that would require additional
engineered elements to stabilize the proposed channel positions and/or size. These elements include two vertical
grade controls to stabilize the bed elevation (at RS 17+00 and RS 99+00), and three lateral grade controls to hold
the proposed streambank and channel location (at RS 17+00 and RS 28+00 and near RS 95+00). In general, the
control structures would be constructed of a combination of rock material and logs, with bioengineered
revegetation above the future waterline. The grade control near RS 95+00 would set the bed elevation for the
reconnection between the river and the lagoon, and the grade control at RS 99+00 would set the bed elevation for
the river mouth. Both of these would be designed to simulate the appearance and function of resistant subsurface
geologic layers (e.g., consolidated lake sediments) that occur naturally in the study area.

Alternative 3 includes channel stabilization on Trout Creek because redirected flows from the Upper Truckee
River would affect the lower segment of Trout Creek. Redirecting the flows of the Upper Truckee River’s main
channel into the remnant channel system of the marsh would be expected to increase streamflow conveyed
through the lowest reach of Trout Creek, creating the potential for future channel adjustments such as bed erosion.
Therefore, Alternative 3 includes installation of vertical grade control(s) and streambank stabilization measures
along about 2,600 feet of lower Trout Creek (from RS 66+00 to 95+00). The vertical grade controls will be of an
adequate number and design to maintain the existing average slope and elevation of the channel and remain stable
under the 100-year peak flows, assuming the combined peaks of Trout Creek and the Upper Truckee River. The
streambank stabilization measures will be designed to remain stable under the 25-year peak flows, assuming the
combined peaks of Trout Creek and the Upper Truckee River. The design will also anticipate and address the
potential effects of sheet and concentrated overflow returning to the channel off the reactivated floodplain.
Alternative 4: Inset Floodplain (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
Under Alternative 4, the geomorphic function of the river channel would be improved without raising the
streambed elevation or increasing channel length, and without constructing vertical or lateral grade-control
elements. Thus, it is fundamentally different from Alternatives 1, 2, and 3. Alternative 4 would directly decrease
channel capacity by lowering bank heights.
Alternative 4 proposes to reestablish active floodplain area by creating floodplain surfaces along much of the
existing river alignment and profile (from RS 0+00 to RS 69+00). About 6,900 feet of the river would be
indirectly modified as part of the floodplain restoration because the new floodplains would be formed by lowering
(excavating) existing river banks and adjoining terrace surfaces. The remaining banks would be strengthened by
bioengineered revegetation, using salvaged/transplanted willows and sod blocks, willow mattresses, and, in some
areas, log revetments.
About 2,400 feet of the river (from RS 69+00 to RS 93+00) would be modified using local cut-and-fill materials
to create a more sinuous low-flow channel, increase bed form diversity, and lower bank angles within an overall
area of about 180,000 square feet. Existing woody vegetation along the banks would be preserved wherever
possible to help provide erosion-resistant areas. The proposed banks would also be strengthened by bioengineered
revegetation, using salvaged/transplanted willows and sod blocks, willow mattresses, and, in some areas, log
revetments.
Alternative 5: No-Project/No-Action
Alternative 5 would not provide any actions to reestablish and improve floodplain processes or modify the
existing degraded channel throughout the study area (from RS 0+00 to RS 100+00). This alternative would allow,
but not encourage, enhance, or speed up, the passive recovery of the system via natural processes. Streambank
failures, bank retreat, and channel widening combined with point bar deposition within the inset channel would
create small active floodplain patches over time, but the surrounding terrace would not be reactivated as
floodplain. The straightened reach (from RS 69+00 to RS 93+00) would remain in its existing condition.

SECONDARY CHANNEL REACTIVATION
Alternatives 1–4 would reactivate a 5,800-foot-long existing secondary channel by excavation of its inlet and
outlet on the main channel (at RS 5+25 and RS 11+00) to allow flow to enter the secondary channel whenever the
total streamflow exceeded the main channel’s design flow. The banks of the secondary channel would be
strengthened by bioengineered revegetation in all disturbed areas. Existing woody bank vegetation along the
secondary channel would be preserved to the maximum extent possible, to provide an erosion-resistant edge along
the proposed lowered floodplain between the secondary channel and the main channel.

Alternative 5 would not include deliberate modification of secondary channels. Similar to current conditions, the
existing secondary channels (from RS 5+25 to RS 11+00 and from RS 17+00 to RS 29+00) would be active only
during moderate overbanking flow events where the capacity of the existing channel is exceeded. Although
dependent on the magnitude of these events and associated sediment or debris loads, the most likely result will be
sediment deposition in the secondary channels during overbank flows. However, during or following major
flooding events (i.e., events with deeper and higher velocity flows on the floodplain), erosion of the secondary
channels or sedimentation of the main channel may result in reoccupation of the secondary channel location by
the low-flow channel, a condition that has occurred in the past.
For all reactivated channels and floodplain areas with remnant channels having accumulated fine sediment and/or
organic materials, final project design and revegetation specifications would include measures to minimize the
risk that such materials would become mobilized if a large flood flow occurs during the first few years after
construction. As feasible, the measures would remove and/or stabilize the materials adequately to resist expected
erosive forces if a large flood (i.e., 25-year and higher peak flow) occurred within the first five years after
implementation:
►

Remove loose, unvegetated, or otherwise unstable fine sediment and/or organic material within remnant
channel sections to be reactivated (either directly connected to the restored channel or as part of reactivated
floodplain) to eliminate the potential pollutant source. The excavated materials could be salvaged for soil
amendment and revegetation use in off-channel areas if suitable or disposed of properly off-site.

►

Revegetate loose, unvegetated, or otherwise unstable fine sediment and/or organic material within remnant
channel sections to be reactivated (either directly connected to the restored channel or as part of reactivated
floodplain) to increase roughness and reduce velocities. Revegetation of these areas will meet species,
density, planting methods, irrigation, and success criteria similar to streambank plantings.

RIVER MOUTH SIZE REDUCTION
The incised river mouth is overly wide and deep, allowing lake water inflow even during relatively low water
surface elevations in the lake (i.e., low lake stands). The mouth configuration and the incised bed of the
straightened river reach allow lake backwater effects to extend more than 2,000 feet up the river during high lake
stands and to a somewhat lesser extent during lower lake stands. The lake backwater reduces flow velocities,
reduces hydraulic complexity, flattens the channel bed, and limits habitat diversity. Although the project is not
intended to address the backwater conditions normally expected during high lake stands, Alternatives 1-3 include
modifications to the river mouth that would decrease the width of the river mouth and limit inflow of lake water
during low lake levels. Alternatives 1-3 would also raise the minimum bed elevation at the mouth by installing
resistant materials to reestablish the approximate elevation of consolidated sediment in the channel that existed
before the river was channelized. Below, restoration elements at the river mouth are described in greater detail for
each alternative.
Alternative 1: Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
The present location and bed elevation of the river mouth downstream of RS 95+00 would be retained, but the
minimum bed elevation would be raised and the capacity would be reduced at RS 99+00 by installing both an
engineered grade control and bioengineered revegetation. The grade control structure would be created at or near
the new bridge (RS 99+00) that would be designed to simulate the function of naturally-occurring subsurface
geologic layers (i.e., resistant, cohesive lake sediments), to hold the minimum bed elevation at approximately
6,222 feet. This would be lower than median lake level but would restore a higher bed than the historic dredged
depth. Over time, vegetation growth between RS 99+00 and near the beach ridge would increase roughness,
encourage aggradation, and protect against erosion. Existing woody vegetation in the areas disturbed for grade
control would be salvaged and transplanted as part of the bioengineered revegetation activities of the grade
control structure and the footings and abutments of the bridge.

Alternative 2: New Channel–West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure)
The present river mouth location, elevation, and size would be replaced by a new mouth, excavated in existing
topography west of the existing channel, along the same alignment (planform) and with the same profile (bed
elevation) and capacity (about 38 feet wide and 4 feet deep) as the proposed new channel. This approach would
restore a 20,000-square-foot mouth area of similar size and dimension to a configuration that likely existed before
historic dredging. A grade control structure would be installed in the channel near RS 96+00 to provide resistance
to vertical changes in bed elevation. The abandoned 31,000-square-foot mouth area would be backfilled to match
the adjoining ground and would be revegetated with native species suited to the floodplain, lagoon, and/or beach
conditions of the proposed finished elevations.
Alternative 3: Middle Marsh Corridor (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
The existing river mouth location downstream of RS 95+00 would be retained, but the minimum bed elevation
would be raised and the capacity would be reduced at RS 99+00 by installing both an engineered grade control
and bioengineered revegetation. The grade-control structure would be designed to simulate the function of
naturally-occurring subsurface geologic layers (i.e., resistant, cohesive lake sediments) to hold the minimum bed
elevation at approximately 6,222 feet. This would be lower than median lake level but would restore a higher bed
than the historic dredged depth. Over time, vegetation growth between RS 99+00 and near the beach ridge would
increase roughness, encourage aggradation, and protect against erosion. Existing woody vegetation in the areas
disturbed for grade control would be salvaged and transplanted as part of the bioengineered revegetation
activities.
Alternative 4: Inset Floodplain (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
The existing river mouth location, size, and bed elevation would be retained downstream of RS 93+00. Grade
control in this lowest segment of the river is not proposed. The existing stream processes, including response to
lake level fluctuations, would continue. Channel aggradation would likely occur during high lake stands;
downcutting could occur during low lake stands.
Alternative 5: No-Project/No-Action
The existing river mouth location, size, and bed elevation would continue to adjust to lake levels, streamflows,
and sediment loads. It would aggrade and/or widen for a few years, then flush out (erode) the accumulated
sediment during high-water years and/or floods. Extensive backwater from the lake would continue to move up
the deepened, straightened channel reach, particularly when the lake is above median elevation.

FLOODPLAIN LOWERING
In addition to reducing channel capacity, the hydrologic connectivity of the channel and floodplain would be
increased by lowering portions of the floodplain. During floodplain lowering operations, removal of existing
woody vegetation along the margins would be avoided to the extent possible, to retain the erosion resistance
provided by vegetation along the edge of the lowered floodplain. The surface of lowered floodplains and all
disturbed areas of the floodplain would be revegetated with a mixture of salvaged/transplanted sod and willow,
willow wattles, and new plantings.
The location and extent of areas of lowered floodplain differ among alternatives. These differences are described
below.

Alternative 1: Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
A lowered floodplain (covering about 83,000 square feet) would be excavated into the existing terrace west of the
main channel, to improve floodplain function downstream of U.S. 50 from RS 5+25 to RS 11+00. This excavated
area between the main channel and the existing secondary channel would be about three feet deep.
Alternative 2: New Channel–West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure)
Two lowered floodplain areas (covering 173,000 square feet) would be excavated into the existing terrace
between the main and secondary channels, to improve floodplain function between RS 5+25 and RS 11+00 and
between RS 21+00 and RS 29+00. From RS 5+25 to RS 11+00, the excavation would cover about 83,000 square
feet west of the main channel, and from RS 21+00 to RS 29+00, the excavation would cover about 90,000 square
feet east of the main channel, averaging about three feet deep in both areas.
Alternative 3: Middle Marsh Corridor (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
Under Alternative 3, three lowered floodplain areas (covering 214,000 square feet) would be excavated into the
existing terrace between the main and secondary river channels, to improve floodplain function from RS 0+00 to
RS 5+00, RS 5+25 to RS 11+00, and RS 21+00 to RS 29+00. From RS 0+00 to RS 5+00, the excavation would
cover about 41,000 square feet between the main channel and the building pad of the adjacent commercial
development, averaging about 2.5 feet deep. From RS 5+25 to RS 11+00, the excavation would cover about
83,000 square feet west of the main channel, averaging about three feet deep. From RS 21+00 to RS 29+00, the
excavation would cover about 90,000 square feet east of the main channel, averaging about one foot deep.
Alternative 4: Inset Floodplain (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
A lowered floodplain (covering about 101,000 square feet) would be excavated into the existing terrace west of
the main channel, to improve floodplain function immediately downstream of U.S. 50 from RS 0+00 to RS
11+00. From RS 0+00 to RS 5+00, the excavation would cover about 18,000 square feet between the main
channel and the building pad of the adjacent commercial development, averaging 2.5 feet deep. From RS 5+25 to
RS 11+00, the excavation would cover about 83,000 square feet between the main channel and the existing
secondary channel, averaging three feet deep.
An inset floodplain would be excavated into the existing terrace on both sides of the main channel from RS 11+00
to RS 69+00 to improve floodplain function. The excavation would cover about 374,000 square feet, averaging
three feet deep. The width of the inset floodplain on either side of the channel would vary somewhat, to simulate
natural variability and potentially to help avoid disturbing biological and cultural resources.
Alternative 5: No-Project/No-Action
The floodplain would not be lowered.

REMOVAL OF EXISTING FILL FROM FLOODPLAIN
In addition to the floodplain restoration described in the preceding section, Alternatives 1–4 would restore
floodplain function by excavating the reserved fill to native ground elevation on about 206,000 square feet of the
LWS Restoration Area. Under Alternative 5, the reserved fill at the LWS Restoration Area would remain in place
and within the 100-year floodplain.
Alternatives 1, 2, and 3 would also restore floodplain function by excavating previously placed fill at the TKPOA
Corporation Yard, similar to adjacent natural surfaces, over an area of about 91,000 square feet. (This restoration
of the corporation yard would be contingent on the consent of TKPOA.) Under Alternatives 4 and 5, previously
placed fill at the TKPOA Corporation Yard would remain on the terrace and in the 100-year floodplain. If

chemically and physically suitable, the excavated fill would be used to backfill channel segments; otherwise, the
material would be hauled to an appropriate off-site disposal site.
After removal of existing fill, the entire restored floodplain surface and all disturbed areas would be revegetated
with a mixture of salvaged/transplanted sod and willow, willow wattles, and new plantings.

FILL OF ABANDONED CHANNEL SEGMENTS
Where new channel segments would replace existing segments, the abandoned channel segments would be
partially or completely filled. The backfilled channels and all disturbed areas would be revegetated with a mixture
of salvaged/transplanted sod and willow, willow wattles, and new plantings. The construction specifications for
the filling of abandoned channels would be prepared by a qualified engineer and include standards that minimize
the potential for erosion of the backfilled channels. The specifications would include compaction standards to
avoid significant differences between the density of fill and surrounding floodplain sediments and limit the
potential for differential settlement of the fill. The specifications would be developed on the basis of the range of
physical attributes of the soils encountered but would generally require that fill density be within ten percent of
the average density of natural soils. Additionally, the specifications would specify maximum slope angles for the
slope formed at the edges of the fill (also dependent on soil properties) and vegetative cover.
The alternatives differ in the extent of channel backfilling, as described below.
Alternative 1: Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
Complete backfill of about 3,000 feet of old channel (from RS 63+00 to RS 93+00) would bring the abandoned
channel areas up to the elevation of adjacent terrace/floodplain surfaces and restore floodplain function to about
150,000 square feet. Partial backfill of about 1,200 feet of old channel (from RS 17+00 to RS 29+00) would bring
the abandoned channel areas up to within two to three feet of the adjacent existing terrace/floodplain surface, thus
providing a secondary channel function on about 26,000 square feet of the floodplain that would be active when
total streamflow exceeded design flow in the main channel.
Alternative 2: New Channel–West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure)
Complete backfill of about 5,700 feet of old channel (from RS 38+00 to RS 95+00) would bring the abandoned
channel areas up to the elevation of adjacent terrace/floodplain surfaces and restore floodplain function to about
285,000 square feet. Partial backfill of about 1,700 feet of old channel (from RS 21+00 to RS 38+00) would bring
the abandoned channel areas up to within two to three feet of the adjacent exiting terrace/floodplain surface, and
this would provide a secondary channel function on about 50,000 square feet of the floodplain that would be
active when total streamflow exceeded design flow of the main channel.
Alternative 3: Middle Marsh Corridor (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
Complete backfill of about 3,800 feet of old channel (from RS 17+00 to RS 33+00 and RS 73+00 to RS 95+00)
would bring the abandoned channel areas up to the elevation of adjacent terrace/floodplain surfaces and restore
floodplain function to about 190,000 square feet. Partial backfill of about 4,000 feet of old channel (from RS
33+00 to RS 73+00) would bring the abandoned channel areas up to within two to three feet of the adjacent
existing terrace/floodplain surface and provide about 120,000 square feet of floodplain, active only when total
streamflow exceeded the design flow of the main channel.
Alternative 4: Inset Floodplain (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
Channel segments would not be abandoned and backfilled. However, channel segments would be modified during
floodplain lowering.

Alternative 5: No-Project/No-Action
No channel segments would be abandoned and backfilled.

REACTIVATION OF FLOODPLAIN TERRACE
Under Alternative 3, floodplain function and connectivity would also be improved across U.S. 50 and between the
main channel and the building pad of the adjacent commercial development by boring two overflow culverts
through the roadfill. Two corrugated metal pipes would be installed, with the upstream inlet at an elevation that
would receive water when the channel upstream of the bridge was out of bank. The culverts would have a flow
capacity of about 150 cfs. The culverts would begin taking flow when the river flow is around 2,000 cfs (between
the five-year and ten-year event). The downstream outlet would have a rock-lined, energy dissipation–flared
section that would activate the isolated terrace west of the channel from RS 0+00 to RS 5+00 (that would become
lowered floodplain). The overflow culverts would also provide a small reduction in high flows that would be
conveyed under the U.S. 50 bridge, to reduce hydraulic stress on the main channel’s banks during large
streamflows.
This river restoration element is not included in Alternatives 1, 2, 4, or 5.

MODIFICATION OF EXISTING STORMWATER DISCHARGE LOCATIONS
Under Alternatives 2 and 3, river and floodplain modifications would require relocating and/or modifying existing
stormwater discharge locations near RS 46+50 and RS 66+00. At locations near the existing discharge points,
stormwater basins would be installed (either excavated from native meadow material or a portion of the
abandoned channel). The basins would replace the discharge function and increase the pretreatment of urban
runoff before discharge into open surface water of the Upper Truckee River, because they would provide
opportunities for settling, infiltration, and percolation. The size and volume would be determined in consultation
with the City of South Lake Tahoe (CSLT) and the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB),
but the overall shape would simulate naturally occurring floodplain basins and would be vegetated with native
plant species.
The restoration elements of Alternatives 1 and 4 would not include modification or relocation of existing
stormwater discharge locations. Alternative 5 would not include restoration elements, and thus, also would not
modify or relocate existing stormwater discharge locations.

REESTABLISHMENT OF A RIVER-OVERFLOW LAGOON
The lagoon area connected with the Upper Truckee River is a natural feature that was likely larger before human
disturbance. The surface water of a dredged lagoon (the Sailing Lagoon) is hydraulically connected to Lake Tahoe
through the Tahoe Keys Marina channel. The Sailing Lagoon is not connected to the river. It has been part of
Tahoe Keys Marina since the 1950s, resulting from dredging and fill activities to provide for various navigation
routes.
Alternatives 1, 2, and 3 would reestablish a hydrologic connection between a restored, naturally functioning
lagoon in the general location of the existing Sailing Lagoon and the Upper Truckee River near the river mouth by
constructing a bulkhead at the Sailing Lagoon to block its open connection with the marina and Lake Tahoe, and
topographically modifying the Sailing Lagoon, including creation of a re-excavated connection with the Upper
Truckee River so that the river would become a surface-water source to the lagoon. (The bulkhead would be
located approximately 30 feet east of the existing opening.) The restored lagoon would be analogous to what
exists behind Barton Beach near Trout Creek, but on a larger scale (approximately 105,000 square feet). For each
alternative, the lagoon restoration elements are described in greater detail in the following sections.

Alternative 1: Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
To restore the natural river/lagoon connection, an engineered 290-foot-long sheet pile bulkhead and earthen levee
would be constructed across the dredged west end of the Sailing Lagoon approximately 30 feet east of the existing
bulkhead along the marina, and the fill blocking the east end would be removed. Final design would include a
flow control feature for water flowing into the Sailing Lagoon during bank overtopping events when the lagoon
starting water surface would be low. The control feature (e.g., a rock lined channel or weir structure) would be
designed to control the location of overflow into the lagoon and prevent the development of a permanent,
uncontrolled erosion channel connecting the river to the lagoon. Invasive species would be addressed through
development and implementation of an Invasive Species Management Plan as described in Environmental
Commitment 4, Table 2-6 below.
Following control and removal of invasive animals and plants, local cut and fill would then be used to recontour
the topography of the lagoon and connect levee areas with adjoining ground. The lagoon, levee, and all disturbed
areas would be revegetated using a mixture of woody and herbaceous species, suited to the anticipated range of
moisture conditions from lagoon to levee crest. The east end of the lagoon connection with the river would be
constructed as a vertical grade-control structure to simulate the appearance and function of naturally occurring
resistant geologic layers and would include bioengineered revegetation to increase erosion resistance along the
shared bank between river and lagoon. A grade-control structure (whose exact location would differ among
Alternatives [see Exhibits 2-1 through 2-4]) would set the minimum bed elevation to protect the west bank from
erosion and establish a residual lagoon water surface elevation during low lake levels.
Salvaged soil and vegetation would be used, along with plantings, to revegetate the proposed lagoon area, using a
mixture of native plant species appropriate for planned water depths.
Alternative 2: New Channel–West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure)
Alternative 2 would reestablish a river-overflow lagoon along the Upper Truckee River at the Sailing Lagoon as
described for Alternative 1.
Alternative 3: Middle Marsh Corridor (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
Alternative 3 would reestablish a river-overflow lagoon along the Upper Truckee River at the Sailing Lagoon as
described for Alternative 1.
Alternative 4: Inset Floodplain (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
The previously dredged/filled Upper Truckee River–lagoon connection would not be modified, leaving the direct
open-water connection between the Tahoe Keys Marina channel, the Sailing Lagoon, and Lake Tahoe unchanged.
Alternative 5: No-Project/No-Action
The previously dredged/filled Upper Truckee River–lagoon connection would not be modified, leaving the direct
open-water connection between the Tahoe Keys Marina channel, the Sailing Lagoon, and Lake Tahoe unchanged.

REMOVAL OF EXISTING FILL FROM BEHIND THE EAST END OF BARTON BEACH
Alternatives 1 and 2 would remove existing artificial fill from behind the east end of Barton Beach to restore
lagoon and wet meadow conditions. Removal of this fill would restore lagoon and wet meadow conditions on
about 18,000 square feet. Fill would be excavated to native ground elevation, at a depth averaging about two feet.
Salvaged soil and vegetation would be used, along with plantings, to revegetate the restored lagoon and wet
meadow, using a mixture of native plant species appropriate for planned elevations. Under Alternatives 3–5, the
artificial fill behind the east end of Barton Beach would not be removed.

OVERBANK FLOW AND FLOODING CONSIDERATIONS
Under existing conditions, the incised and widened channel does not allow natural overbank flow onto the
meadow during small or moderate streamflow events, an important factor for sustaining ecological values of the
adjacent marsh and wet meadow. The channel is overtopped only during relatively large flows (approximately
1,000 cfs or greater). Alternatives 1–4 would use a combination of modifications to the existing channel and/or
construction of a new channel to decrease the elevation difference between the channel bed and the adjacent
meadow, and to reduce channel capacity to a more geomorphically-appropriate size. These changes would
reestablish an active floodplain that receives overbank flows during small events (e.g., the two- to five-year storm
events).
For reactivated channel and floodplain that has remnant channels with accumulated fine sediment and/or organic
materials, final project design and revegetation specifications would include measures to minimize the risk that
such materials would become mobilized, as described above under ‘Secondary Channel Reactivation.’
The existing flood hazard affecting adjacent neighborhoods would not be increased by Alternatives 1–4. The
alternatives would improve the active floodplain’s storage volume and flow routing in the valley reach, but would
not alter storage for the overall 100-year floodplain. During lower magnitude flow events, floodplain storage
would be increased by lowering portions of the floodplain. Hydraulic modeling of existing conditions and each
alternative configuration was used to verify that overbank flows could be increased for smaller flow events
without an increase in flooding hazards (Conservancy and DGS 2006).

BANK STABILIZATION AT EAST VENICE DRIVE
Under existing conditions, boaters use the Upper Truckee River and Lake Tahoe for non-motorized recreational
boating (kayaking, canoeing, rafting, and tubing). Boaters float down the Upper Truckee from various upstream
locations and have historically taken their boats out at the point along the Upper Truckee River closest to East
Venice Drive. This location has a steep and eroding bank. Boaters also use this location to put boats into the river
to float out to Lake Tahoe. To protect banks from erosion from this ongoing use, the alternatives propose bank
stabilization, designed to fit into the natural setting and be constructed of boulders, rocks, and logs, with
biotechnical elements as feasible.
Alternatives 1 and 4 would stabilize the existing location where boaters enter and exit the river. Alternative 2
would stabilize the bank of the newly constructed channel at the point closest to East Venice Drive. To further
protect resources, a boardwalk (approximately 150 feet long) would be constructed to allow users access to the
river from the road. Alternative 3 has no stabilizations or infrastructure proposed in this vicinity, since the concept
of Alternative 3 does not dictate the location of the channel(s) downstream of the pilot channel. Alternative 3
would allow natural processes to determine flow paths through the marsh. It is possible that boating may only be
feasible during relatively high flow periods and/or high water years, but the location(s) for potential boat put in or
take out, and of associated bank protection, cannot be readily predicted at this time.

TERRESTRIAL HABITAT RESTORATION AND ENHANCEMENT ELEMENTS OF THE
PROJECT

In addition to the restoration and enhancement of aquatic habitats and floodplain hydrologic and geomorphic
processes, Alternatives 1–4 would also restore and enhance terrestrial habitats. This restoration and enhancement
elements would include the restoration of riparian habitats in conjunction with river channel and floodplain
restoration, and also beach dune restoration, forest enhancement, and enhancement of core habitat. These
terrestrial habitat restoration and enhancement elements of the project are described below.

WILLOW SCRUB–WET MEADOW RESTORATION
The restoration of willow scrub–wet meadow is included in Alternatives 1–4. The river restoration described
previously would create additional willow scrub–wet meadow on the lowered or restored floodplains and other
locations.

MONTANE MEADOW RESTORATION
Under Alternatives 1, 2, and 3, montane meadow would be restored from the disturbed land of the TKPOA
Corporation Yard. The restoration of the corporation yard would be contingent on the consent of TKPOA.

DUNE/BEACH RESTORATION
Alternatives 1 and 2 include the restoration of sand ridges (“dunes”) at Cove East Beach that were graded and
leveled as part of the Tahoe Keys development. The restoration would occur in conjunction with removal of fill in
the southern portion of Cove East Beach and the modification and reconnection of the Sailing Lagoon to the
Upper Truckee River.
In addition, the construction of a new river mouth west of the existing one in Alternative 2 would provide the
opportunity for a small area of beach restoration in the existing channel location. Because this area is near existing
Tahoe yellow cress (TYC) habitat, the project under Alternative 2 would provide potential TYC habitat in this
beach restoration area. Areas around the existing river mouth may also be restored to beach habitat in Alternatives
1–4 because the mouth width would be reduced, and in the case of Alternative 2, relocated.
Alternative 1: Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
The previously leveled area between Cove East Beach and the Sailing Lagoon would be modified under
Alternative 1 to reestablish depressions (swales) and dunes (ridges) with increased soil and hydrologic diversity.
Local cut-and-fill materials would be used to simulate linear swales and ridges, parallel to the shoreline.
Approximately three acres (130,000 square feet) would be restored, but the exact layout and extent could be
adjusted to provide options to protect identified existing biological and/or cultural resources. Salvaged soil and
vegetation would be used, along with plantings, to revegetate with a mixture of woody and herbaceous species
suited to the anticipated range of moisture conditions.
Alternative 2: New Channel–West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure)
The previously-leveled area between Cove East Beach and the Sailing Lagoon would be modified to reestablish
depressions swales and ridges as described for Alternative 1. In addition, a portion of the abandoned river mouth
would be recontoured and revegetated as beach/dune ridge and face to provide for a small additional area of TYC
habitat.
Alternative 3: Middle Marsh Corridor (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
The previously leveled area between Cove East Beach and the Sailing Lagoon would not be modified.
Alternative 4: Inset Floodplain (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
The previously leveled area between Cove East Beach and the Sailing Lagoon would not be modified.
Alternative 5: No-Project/No-Action
The previously leveled area between Cove East Beach and the Sailing Lagoon would not be modified.

FOREST ENHANCEMENT
Alternatives 1–4 include enhancement of Jeffrey pine and lodgepole pine forests near the Highland Woods
subdivision that have been disturbed by past land uses. Enhancement measures would include the removal or
relocation and restoration of user-created trails and some other disturbed areas and invasive-plant control.
In particular, these enhancements would be intended to improve the quality of edge habitat between the marsh and
the forest and to provide important habitat for terrestrial wildlife species. The acreage of these enhancements is
proposed to be the same for Alternatives 1–4 (approximately 7.7 acres).
Alternative 5 would not implement the forest enhancement element of Alternatives 1–4. However, the
Conservancy has been implementing localized habitat enhancement (e.g., removal of invasive plants,
decommissioning of some trails), and similar actions would likely continue to be implemented.

ENHANCEMENT OF CORE HABITAT
Alternatives 1–4 would all enhance an area of “core habitat” that contains sensitive marsh habitats in the center of
the study area (308, 344, 251, and 350 acres for Alternatives 1 through 4, respectively). The enhancement of this
area would be intended to provide greater quality habitat by being exposed to less human disturbance. The edges
of the core habitat areas would be approximately 150 feet from potential sources of disturbance of wildlife by
humans (i.e., study area boundaries, access trails, or the river). Recreational access within the core habitat area
would be discouraged through use of habitat protection elements—perimeter trails and overlooks, signs, fences,
berms, wet swales, and other design elements—that would direct access away from the core habitat. In addition,
existing user-created trails within the core habitat area would be restored to native vegetation, where appropriate.
The location and extent of the core habitat area varies among alternatives, depending on the location of the
restored river corridor, which would continue to act as both a disturbance corridor and a barrier to entry into the
center of the marsh from the western side of the study area. Alternatives 1, 2, and 4 would keep a river corridor
barrier near the existing river corridor. Thus, the river and its associated floodplain would continue to limit access
from the west side of the study area. Because Alternative 3 would move the river to the middle of the marsh, this
alternative could potentially allow recreational use to expand further into the marsh from the west side of the
study area than Alternatives 1, 2, 4, and 5. However, Alternative 3 would create additional wet marsh conditions
east of the existing channel, a condition that would limit human activities during spring and early summer.
Alternative 5 would not protect an extensive area of core habitat. However, the Conservancy has been
implementing localized decommissioning of some trails, which may help to improve core habitat, and similar
actions would likely continue to be implemented.

2.3.3

PUBLIC ACCESS AND RECREATION INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENTS OF THE
PROJECT

Project objectives include balancing public access and recreation infrastructure construction and operation with
habitat restoration and protection. Five main assumptions guided the design of the public access and recreation
infrastructure in Alternatives 1–4:
1. Based on the study area’s location (i.e., adjacent to neighborhoods and a high-use recreation area [Tahoe Keys
Marina]) and existing use patterns, people would continue to use the Upper Truckee Marsh to some degree,
even with some level of access restrictions.
2. To most effectively protect sensitive wildlife and plant habitat, public access would need to be allowed and
managed to the extent that most visitors would be satisfied with their level of access and would not intrude
into sensitive areas.

Description of Alternatives

California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

3. Excessive levels of recreation infrastructure and access would compromise the quality and function of
sensitive habitats by promoting high levels of disturbance. However, too many overall restrictions would
encourage uncontrolled access to sensitive areas.
4. Although public-access and recreation elements, such as pedestrian trails, would disturb vegetation and
wildlife directly and indirectly, these elements, if designed appropriately, could be valuable tools for directing
most access away from sensitive habitats while maintaining existing recreation opportunities.
5. Some level of well-designed public access infrastructure in non-sensitive areas, combined with protective
elements and environmental education, would be the most effective approach to protecting sensitive wildlife
habitat in the study area.
Also, the 1988 litigation settlement leading to the acquisition of the Cove East Beach property in the northwest
corner of the study area requires that recreational beach access west of the river mouth be maintained (People of
the State of California vs. Dillingham Development Company and TRPA, CIV-S-85-0873-EJG [February 25,
1988]). Therefore, the focus of the elements west of the Upper Truckee River, near the LWS Restoration Area and
Cove East Beach are intended to provide public access and recreation, while most of the elements proposed for
the east and south sides of the study area are intended to protect habitat and direct public access away from
sensitive areas of the marsh and thus contribute to the protection of wildlife and sensitive habitat.
Some key design parameters for maintaining access that were evaluated during alternatives development included
the number and location of scenic viewpoints, the level of interconnectivity (via trails) between viewpoints or
other destinations, connection to trails outside the study area, and access to non-sensitive destinations near the
beach or river.
Based on these assumptions and considerations, Alternatives 1–4 each provide infrastructure for public access and
recreational use of the site, but at different levels:
►

►

►

►

►

Alternative 1 would provide for a potential “maximum” level of public access and recreation infrastructure
that includes two bridges, two kiosks, a 27-space parking lot, three observation areas, signage, boardwalks
and pedestrian trails, and bicycle paths.
Alternative 2 would provide a “minimum” level of infrastructure that includes a pedestrian trail to Cove East
Beach (which would replace the existing pedestrian trail), five viewpoints, a fishing platform, and signage.
Alternative 3 would provide a “moderate” level of infrastructure that includes three pedestrian trails (two
segments of which would be boardwalks), a kiosk, one observation area, six viewpoints, a fishing platform,
and signage at multiple locations.
Alternative 4 would provide a “moderate” level of infrastructure that includes three pedestrian trails, a kiosk,
two observation areas, five viewpoints, and signage at multiple locations.
Alternative 5 (No-Project/No-Action) would not take any direct steps to construct public access and
recreation infrastructure (e.g., viewpoints or additional trails). This alternative would maintain existing
infrastructure and might result in the construction of some additional, smaller elements (e.g., signage).

The infrastructure proposed for recreation and public access elements of each alternative are summarized in
Table 2-4 and described in the sections below. In each alternative, the public access and recreation infrastructure
and the river restoration elements would not be interdependent. Thus, different combinations of these elements
could be feasible. However, the final design and locations of public access and recreational infrastructure
elements would be influenced by the restoration elements of the alternative that is selected.

To minimize the potential for adverse hydrology or water quality effects of any proposed public access
infrastructure, Environmental Commitment 11, Incorporate Effective Permanent Stormwater Best Management
Practices, would be applied as part of the final design.

OBSERVATION AREAS AND VIEWPOINTS
Each alternative proposes a combination of observation areas and viewpoints. These facilities would be
interspersed throughout the project area in the various alternatives as can be seen in Exhibits 2-1 – 2-4 and
Appendix C, “Schematic Plans.” The elements for each of the specific alternatives are described below.
Alternative 1: Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
Under Alternative 1, an observation area would be constructed on a platform at the end of the boardwalk near East
Barton Beach to provide an overlook of the lake, beach, and marsh, yet discourage visitors from entering the
beach and using the lagoon. This segment would tie into the proposed boardwalk that would cross the northern
edge of the marsh and connect to the proposed bridge over the Upper Truckee River, and thus, connect the east
and west sides of the study area. (The bridge is described in “Bicycle Paths, Pedestrian Trails, Boardwalks and
Bridges” below.) Final siting of the observation area would emphasize a location that would provide visitors with
views of a scenic destination (e.g., well-placed overlooks and vistas and views of Lake Tahoe).
Six viewpoints in addition to the observation area would be constructed along the perimeter path. One of these
viewpoints would be located along the loop path near the Highland Woods subdivision, and five would be
distributed along the east edge of the study area. In Alternative 1, all six viewpoints would be interconnected via
the bicycle path. Like the observation area, the viewpoints would be sited in locations with scenic views across
the marsh, providing an alternative that would discourage physical entry into the marsh interior.

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Project Alternatives

Alternative 2: New Channel–West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure)
Under Alternative 2, four new viewpoints would be constructed along the east edge of the study area. These
viewpoints would be sited in locations with scenic views across the marsh to provide an alternative to and
discourage entry into the core marsh habitats. They would be accessed by short pedestrian trails extending from
the regional bicycle trail on El Dorado Avenue or other streets in the Al Tahoe subdivision. None of the
viewpoints would be interconnected by a trail between them (i.e., they would be “terminal” viewpoints).
Also, on the west side of the study area, one viewpoint would extend from the northeast corner of the loop trail
near Cove East Beach. The existing shore zone and river mouth in this area experience high levels of recreational
use and disturbances to vegetation, soils, and wildlife. The new viewpoint would provide views across the river
mouth and out across the lake as well as views of the meadow and lagoon to the east. This viewpoint would direct
some recreation use away from those areas, reducing disturbances to waterfowl and shorebirds.
Alternative 3: Middle Marsh Corridor (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
Under Alternative 3, five viewpoints would be constructed along the pedestrian trails and bicycle path. One of
these viewpoints would be located along the bicycle path near the Highland Woods subdivision, near the junction
of the proposed pedestrian trail and bicycle path in that area; four would be distributed along the eastern edge of
the study area. Three of the viewpoints along the eastern edge of the study area would be connected by the eastern
pedestrian trail; the remaining viewpoint, near the end of Placer Avenue, would not be connected by formalized
trails.
West of the Upper Truckee River, by Cove East Beach, a viewpoint would be connected to the pedestrian trail,
near Lake Tahoe and the mouth of the Upper Truckee River. An observation area would be connected to the
pedestrian trail to Cove East Beach, near the proposed river-connected lagoon. All observation areas and
viewpoints these facilities would be sited in locations with scenic views across the marsh and/or lake to provide
an alternative to and discourage entry into the marsh interior.
Alternative 4: Inset Floodplain (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
Under Alternative 4, along the eastern edge of the study area, an observation area would be constructed along the
pedestrian trail near the end of San Francisco Avenue to provide an overlook of the marsh, yet discourage users
from entering the marsh itself. Five viewpoints in addition to the observation area would also be constructed. One
of these viewpoints would be located in the southeastern portion of the study area along the existing bicycle trail
near Trout Creek. The other four would be distributed along the eastern edge of the study area. Three of them
would be connected by the eastern pedestrian trail.
West of the Upper Truckee River, by Cove East Beach, an observation area would be connected to the pedestrian
trail to Cove East Beach, adjacent to the marina and restored wetlands with scenic views of the marsh and/or lake.
All observation areas and viewpoints would be sited in locations with scenic views across the marsh and/or lake
to provide an alternative to and discouraging entry into the marsh interior.
Alternative 5: No-Project/No-Action
No viewpoints or observation areas would be added to the existing trail system under Alternative 5.

FISHING PLATFORM
Alternatives 2 and 3 include a fishing platform. This fishing platform would be constructed on the edge of the
new river-connected lagoon; it would be connected to and accessed by the loop trail around the perimeter of Cove
East Beach which would replace the existing pedestrian trail.

BICYCLE PATHS, PEDESTRIAN TRAILS, BOARDWALKS AND BRIDGES
Each alternative proposes a combination of bicycle paths, pedestrian trails, and bridges. All bicycle paths would
be Class I/Shared-Use Paths [as described in TRPA and TMPO 2010].) Alternative 1 also includes bridges
connecting paths across the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek. Although these elements are for public
recreation and access, the designs will emphasize protecting habitat, especially east of the river. The specific
locations of the proposed infrastructure can be seen in Exhibits 2-1 – 2-4. The elements for each of the specific
alternatives are described below.
Alternative 1: Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
Under Alternative 1, the existing trail that provides public access to Cove East Beach would be modified to a
bicycle path. The bicycle path would connect to the existing Class 2 bike lanes on East Venice Drive. This path
would be eight to ten feet wide and composed of decomposed granite or asphalt concrete. The total length of the
bicycle path from East Venice Drive to Cove East Beach, including the loop at the beach, would be approximately
1,040 feet.
Alternative 1 would also include a new boardwalk and bridge, connecting the east and west sides of the study
area. The mouth of the Upper Truckee River would be spanned by the bridge that would connect the eastern and
western portions of the boardwalk. The boardwalk would be constructed behind (south of) the barrier beach
(outside of TYC habitat). On the west side of the study area, the boardwalk would connect with the loop of the
bicycle path around the perimeter of Cove East Beach; on the east side, it would tie into a proposed boardwalk
and bicycle path along the eastern perimeter of the study area. The boardwalk and bridge would be approximately
4,000 feet and 225 feet long, and 12 feet and eight to ten feet wide, respectively. At its highest point, the bridge
would be approximately ten feet above the Upper Truckee River. The boardwalk would be elevated
approximately two feet above the ground surface. The final design of the bridge and boardwalk for the trail
crossing the river and marsh would ensure that the structure would not obstruct flood flows to cause any effective
increase in the elevation of the 100-year event in the study area. The final design would be supported by a
hydraulic analysis that evaluates the potential for significant changes to flooding hazards and littoral processes.
The design would be adjusted (e.g., for deck height, location of bridge or boardwalk supports, and cross-sectional
area of those supports) to ensure that flow capacity through the structure is sufficient to pass the 100-year event
without increasing the effective flood elevation.
The bicycle path would continue along the east perimeter adjacent to the Al Tahoe neighborhood with two access
points from the regional bicycle trail network along El Dorado Avenue. The path would then continue north
across a new bridge constructed over Trout Creek (at approximately RS 21+00 on Trout Creek), and run between
the Al Tahoe and Highland Woods subdivisions. On the Highland Woods side the proposed path could be
accessed from the regional bicycle trail at the end of Mackinaw Road and along Springwood Drive. The path
would include a loop route through the wooded area north of the Highland Woods subdivision. The trail in
Alternative 1 is proposed as decomposed granite or asphalt concrete. The path would be approximately 8,650 feet
long and eight to ten feet wide, with two-foot-wide shoulders of decomposed granite on either side. The path
would emphasize habitat protection through directing and managing use in areas already used by the public and
discouraging access to sensitive habitats and the marsh interior.
Alternative 2: New Channel–West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure)
Under Alternative 2, the existing trail providing public access to Cove East Beach would be maintained as a
pedestrian trail. No additional trails, bicycle paths, or bridges would be constructed under Alternative 2. Access
along the eastern perimeter of the study area would end at a series of formal viewpoints with no connecting trails.

2-39

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Project Alternatives

Alternative 3: Middle Marsh Corridor (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
Under Alternative 3, the existing trail providing public access to Cove East Beach would be maintained as a
pedestrian trail. In the southern portion of the study area, adjacent to the Highland Woods subdivision, a bicycle
path approximately 0.4 mile long would loop through the wooded area. At its eastern end, the proposed path could
be accessed from the regional bicycle trail at the end of Mackinaw Road, and at its western end, it could be
accessed from along Springwood Drive. The trail would be decomposed granite, eight to ten feet wide; it would
also have two-foot-wide shoulders of decomposed granite on either side.
Two pedestrian trails also would be included under Alternative 3. One would be connected at both ends to the
bicycle path described above, looping through the same wooded area as the bicycle path. The second pedestrian
trail would extend along the northeastern perimeter of the study area from near Capistrano Avenue to near San
Francisco Avenue, connecting three viewpoints. Two portions of this second trail would be raised boardwalks that
would discourage access to the wetter portions of the study area where people [and dogs] presently walk and
disturb wetland vegetation.
Alternative 4: Inset Floodplain (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
Under Alternative 4, the existing trail providing public access to Cove East Beach would be maintained as a
pedestrian trail.
A pedestrian trail would extend along the northeastern perimeter of the study area from near Capistrano Avenue
to near San Francisco Avenue. A portion of this trail would be a raised boardwalk. The boardwalk would allow
visitors to view the meadow and the lake beyond, while keeping them out of the wetter portions of the study area
where they presently walk and disturb wetland vegetation. This trail would be in an area that already experiences
recreational use, but would end at an observation area prior to reaching Barton Beach and the lake.
In the southern portion of the study area, a bicycle trail (approximately 0.3 mile long) would run along
Springwood Drive at the boundary of the study area and the Highland Woods subdivision. This area already
experiences recreational use. This path would be asphalt concrete, ten feet wide, and have two-foot-wide
shoulders of decomposed granite on either side.
Alternative 5: No-Project/No-Action
No bicycle paths, pedestrian trails, bridges, or boardwalks would be added to the existing trail system with
implementation of Alternative 5.

KIOSKS
Alternatives 1, 3, and 4 include interpretive kiosks that would provide information to support public access,
recreation infrastructure, and visitor education and interpretation of the ecological values of the Upper Truckee
Marsh (e.g., maps and information regarding sensitive resources). With maximum recreation infrastructure
development (Alternative 1), a kiosk would be constructed on high-capability land near the end of East Venice
Drive adjacent to the Tahoe Keys Marina, and a second, smaller kiosk would be constructed along the existing
bicycle path near the Trout Creek Bridge at U.S. 50, in the southeastern corner of the study area. With moderate
recreation infrastructure development (Alternatives 3 and 4), a small kiosk would be constructed at one of two
possible locations: the one-acre Conservancy-owned parcel south of the cul-de-sac at the end of East Venice
Drive, or just north of the cul-de-sac at the LWS Restoration Area. With minimum recreation infrastructure
development (Alternative 2) and the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5), no kiosks would be
constructed.

SIGNAGE
Alternatives 1–4 would include development of an interpretive program and installation of additional signage in
appropriate locations throughout the site (e.g., along trails, in observation areas, at viewpoints, and near sensitive
habitats). This signage would include educational, directional, and safety information to provide public access and
dispersed recreation opportunities. Signs would provide maps at trailheads to illustrate the location of open public
trails and bicycle path routes and closed areas throughout the study area. Signs would also be placed near
sensitive habitats to discourage disturbance of those areas by people and pets, and to engender a resource
stewardship ethic in users.

PARKING LOT
Alternative 1 includes a paved parking lot on Conservancy property at the end of East Venice Drive on the left
side just before the Tahoe Keys Marina entrance, near the proposed kiosk (shown on sheet S-1). The parking lot is
expected to be approximately 280 feet by 74 feet with 27 parking spaces (2 ADA), a four-space bike rack, and one
trash can. The final number of spaces and other amenities would be decided in the later stages of design
development. No additional parking is proposed under Alternatives 2 through 5. TRPA and the CSLT approved
additional Tahoe Keys Marina parking in 2009 and 2010, respectively, but a final agreement has not been
completed. This final long-term lease agreement would create more than 100 spaces and would provide additional
parking for visitors to the marina and the study area alike. The agreement is not a component of the Upper
Truckee River and Marsh Restoration project. As feasible, the final design would include a low-energy parking
lot lighting system (e.g., low wattage LED lamps and/or solar lighting).

2.4

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

The Conservancy has been maintaining existing infrastructure as part of its management of land in the study area
implements management actions supporting public access, recreation, and habitat protection. The agency’s
ongoing management actions in the study area include the following:
►

Maintenance of Facilities. The Conservancy monitors the condition and use of existing facilities, removes
litter and fire pits, and eliminates potentially hazardous conditions (e.g., user-created facilities such as
makeshift bridges). Also, the Conservancy funds the Tahoe Resource Conservation District to contract with
the Clean Tahoe Program for trash removal services, including weekly inspection and maintenance of 12
garbage cans located throughout the property.

►

Monitoring and Outreach. Through a Land Steward, the Conservancy conducts outreach to educate visitors
regarding the importance of resource protection and to discourage incompatible uses. The Conservancy also
monitors recreational use and compliance with Conservancy use policies and CSLT ordinances.

►

Enforcement of Policies. The Conservancy contracts with El Dorado County Animal Control for assistance
with enforcement of CSLT and El Dorado County dog leash ordinances and of the closure to dogs of the area
east of the Upper Truckee River during the waterfowl breeding season (May 1 through July 31). The
Conservancy also contracts with CSLT to provide security patrols within the study area and to enforce
ordinances for City-owned parks.

►

Mosquito Control. The Conservancy regularly communicates with El Dorado County Vector Control
District regarding mosquito production and control. In consultation with the El Dorado County Vector
Control District, the Conservancy provides necessary measures for controlling mosquito production.

►

Invasive Plant Control. The Conservancy monitors for presence of priority invasive species, and to the
extent practicable, implements appropriate measures to control and eradicate populations. The Conservancy

Project Alternatives

also coordinates with the Lake Tahoe Basin Weed Coordinating Group and the Aquatic Invasive Species
Working Group regarding the control of aquatic invasive species.
►

Management of TYC Habitat. The Conservancy has prepared and implements a management plan for TYC
in the study area. This management plan contains a number of management actions including the following:
•

maintaining an exclosure to protect the Upper Truckee East TYC population and regularly evaluating the
effectiveness of its design and placement;

•

participating in annual basin-wide TYC monitoring activities; and,

•

implementing the Imminent Extinction Contingency Plan, if necessary.

Under the action alternatives and the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, this management would continue.
Additional management actions that would be implemented as part of the project are described in Section 2.7,
“Environmental Commitments.”

2.5

MONITORING

A monitoring plan was developed for the project to:
►

characterize baseline conditions;

►

track project performance related to desired outcomes from the concept plan report (Conservancy and DGS
2006:2-1 through 2-14);

►

document effects on relevant TRPA environmental threshold carrying capacities;

►

establish tentative approaches to monitoring for regulatory requirements; and

►

provide information to direct adaptive management.

The plan is intended to coordinate prior, existing, and anticipated monitoring to the extent practicable and to be
consistent with the guidance on monitoring plans for the Upper Truckee River developed by the Upper Truckee
River Watershed Advisory Group (Conservancy 2007).
This monitoring plan describes the variables selected as indicators, a summary of each protocol, quality assurance
mechanisms, and reporting procedures. The protocol summaries include sampling design (i.e., location and timing
of data collection), data collection methods, and guidance for data analysis. These protocol summaries are
provided for all of the following:

qualitative site assessment.

Wildlife monitoring would not directly inform as many aspects of project implementation as other variables.
Thus, wildlife monitoring would be more dependent on the availability of the necessary staff and budget than
other variables. Also, funding may limit implementation of certain components of the plan.
Although this monitoring plan is intended to identify tentative approaches to anticipated regulatory requirements
for monitoring of project impacts on the river, riparian, and marsh habitats, additional monitoring might be
required. Permit conditions will not be known until a restoration plan has been approved by regulatory agencies.
Monitoring of the condition of TYC on the study area is described in a separate management plan prepared for
that plant species (Conservancy and DGS 2007b:24–31). The monitoring of TYC is part of the interagency
monitoring of the species throughout the Tahoe Basin that includes a census of all known populations and
systematic searches of areas supporting unoccupied, potentially suitable habitat.

2.6

CONSTRUCTION

2.6.1

OVERVIEW

This section summarizes the proposed construction activities and schedule for Alternatives 1–4. Construction
would occur between May 1 and October 15 for approximately four years. The actual schedule and construction
phasing may vary from what is presented below depending on permit requirements, final design, and contractor
selection.
Each year, construction activities would begin with mobilization, including construction and maintenance of haul
roads and staging areas, and installation of BMPs and signage in the project vicinity. Similarly, each year, closing
activities would include winterization (i.e., installing BMPs in disturbed areas, demobilizing equipment,
stabilizing access roads, and shutting down the irrigation system), and in Year 4, project shutdown.

2.6.2

CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES AND SCHEDULE

For the action alternatives, construction activities that would occur each year, their location, and duration are
described in greater detail in Table 2-5. Appendix C, “Schematic Plans,” also contains additional information
regarding construction activities. The anticipated construction workers and equipment associated with each of
these activities are listed in Appendix D, “Construction Workers and Equipment for Action Alternatives.” Access
locations, proposed haul routes, and potential storage/staging areas for each alternative are shown in Exhibits 2-5
to 2-8.Construction activities would occur from 8:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. pursuant to Section 68.9 of the TRPA
Code of Ordinances. The construction activities scheduled for each year are summarized below.
The No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not conduct specific, planned construction activities.
Other than routine maintenance, the only construction activities under Alternative 5 would be emergency
response/repair, which could be required in the event that flooding and/or streambank failures on Conservancy
portions of the channels adversely threaten or damage public infrastructure or private property.

YEAR 1
Year 1 construction activities would commence with mobilization activities that would take up to one month to
complete. These mobilization activities would include constructing staging areas and haul roads, installing BMPs,
and placing signage. The initial and primary staging areas for this period would be the California Avenue, LWS,
and Sailing Lagoon staging areas. Expected activities would include delivery and storage of construction
equipment and materials and worker parking. Public road access to these staging areas would be from Tahoe Keys

Boulevard to California or Washington Avenues or East Venice Drive. All construction equipment and haul
trucks would be operated on internal haul roads.
Subsequent activities would include much of the earthwork required for the river and floodplain excavation:
recontouring existing channels, lowering the floodplain, modifying the existing secondary channel, constructing
the new channel, and lowering the floodplain. Most of these activities would take a month or less to complete,
except for new-channel construction under Alternatives 1–3 and floodplain lowering under Alternatives 2–4.
These activities would require one to three months to complete.
Significant excavation and soil movement activities would occur onsite in Year 1. The volume of soil excavated
under Alternatives 1–4 would be approximately 32,000; 48,000; 48,000; and 253,000 cubic yards, respectively.
Under Alternatives 1, 2 and 3, excavated material would be either stockpiled on site at the TKPOA Corporation
Yard, LWS, Sailing Lagoon, Rubicon Trail, and/or Highland Woods storage areas. The excavated materials
would be transported to the staging areas by truck on internal haul roads. The excavated materials would be
temporarily stored in stockpiles with heights generally ranging between three to eight feet and then used for
channel backfilling in Year 3. Due to the large volume of excavation required for floodplain lowering under
Alternative 4, the majority of this material (except the volume needed for on-site backfilling) would be hauled off
site to a location yet to be determined (as approved by TRPA, Lahontan, and other regulatory agencies). After
excavation, permanent revegetation and temporary irrigation would be installed in work areas at final grade, as
soon as possible.
During construction of new and recontoured channels, it is possible that dewatering of excavations (i.e., removal
of collected water) may be required. For all alternatives, a similar strategy for management of dewatering will be
applied. To minimize the potential for dewatering, construction activities within the live channel will be avoided
whenever possible. When construction within the live channel cannot be avoided, the work areas would be
isolated from the live channel by berms. Seepage into the isolated work areas would be pumped and used for
irrigation and dust control. If the quantities of water exceed the demands of dust control or could result in
irrigation runoff, temporary and portable detention basins would be constructed. The basins would be created
using portable containment berms and used to store and treat the groundwater effluent. The stored water would be
used for irrigation or dust control or treated to meet surface water discharge requirements and discharged back
into the live channel.
During Year 1, the use of staging areas differs among the alternatives. For Alternative 1, the Sailing Lagoon and
LWS staging areas would be used for mobilization and storage of equipment for new-channel construction work,
soil stockpiling and revegetation/irrigation, and winterization activities. The California Avenue and, if available,
TKPOA staging areas would be used for staging equipment for recontouring the existing channel, lowering the
floodplain, soil stockpiling, and working on the existing secondary channel. Alternatively, stockpiling of soil
generated in these areas may occur at the LWS staging area.
For Alternative 2, all activities would also utilize the Sailing Lagoon and LWS staging areas for equipment
staging and stockpiling for channel construction in the lower (northern) channel segments. The California Avenue
staging area would be used for construction equipment staging for secondary channel modification, channel
construction, and floodplain lowering in the middle and upper (southern) segments. Soil stockpiling would occur
at the TKPOA and LWS staging areas, and if necessary, at the Rubicon Trail and Highland Woods staging areas.
For Alternative 3, the Sailing Lagoon and LWS staging areas would be used for mobilization and floodplain
lowering activities. The Washington Avenue staging area would be utilized for revegetation/irrigation and
winterization activities, recontouring the existing channel, work on the existing secondary channel, and
construction of the pilot channel and vertical and lateral grade controls. Stockpiling of excavated materials
generated by these activities would occur at the TKPOA, and/or the Rubicon Trail and Highland Woods staging
areas. All soil/sediment transport would occur along internal haul roads.

For Alternative 4, the Sailing Lagoon and LWS staging areas would be used for mobilization, channel
construction and recontouring, stockpiling, revegetation/irrigation, and winterization activities in the northern
portion of the study area. The California Avenue staging area would be utilized for work in the southern portion
of the study area, including lowering the floodplain, inset floodplain construction, and work on the existing
secondary channel. Stockpiling of soils excavated by these activities that would be needed for backfilling would
occur at the LWS, TKPOA, and/or Rubicon Trail staging areas. The volume of excavated materials in excess of
the backfill needs would be transported offsite to an out-of-basin storage or reuse site. The general haul route for
the offsite sediment transport would likely be from Dover Drive or Washington Avenue to Tahoe Keys
Boulevard, then to U.S. 50.

YEAR 2
During Year 2, work would continue on new and modified sections of river channel. Bank protection would be
constructed on both sides of the channel, and for Alternatives 1–3, vertical grade controls would be constructed as
well. Under Alternative 3, overflow culverts would be constructed under U.S. 50 through the embankment fill.
Under Alternative 4, reserve fill located at the LWS Restoration Area would be excavated and hauled off site, and
then the floodplain existing main channel would be recontoured. After recontouring, permanent revegetation and
temporary irrigation would be installed in work areas at final grade as soon as possible. Each of these activities
would take one to two months to complete.
Throughout the construction season, the revegetation treatments conducted during Year 1 would be irrigated and
inspected.
Under Alternatives 1–3, work related to the modification of the Sailing Lagoon would occur during Year 2. The
Sailing Lagoon and LWS staging areas would be used for mobilization, equipment and materials storage, and
worker parking. The lagoon would be isolated from the Tahoe Keys Marina by installing the bulkhead and levee
along the Tahoe Keys Marina channel. The isolated lagoon would then be drained, recontoured, and revegetated
for connection to the Upper Truckee River during Year 3. Recontouring of the Sailing Lagoon would entail
excavation of sediment that would be hauled offsite to an out-of-basin storage or reuse site. The general haul route
for the off-site sediment transport would likely be from Venice Drive to Tahoe Keys Boulevard and then to U.S.
50.The Sailing Lagoon modification activities could take as long as four months to complete. Additionally, these
staging areas would be used to stage and store equipment associated with inspection, revegetation, and irrigation
of channel areas constructed in Year 1 (Alternatives 1 – 4) and vertical grade control construction (Alternative 1)
in the northern portion of the study area.
The California Avenue staging area would be utilized for staging equipment and materials for the bank protection
(Alternatives 1–4) and vertical grade control installation (Alternatives 1, 2, and 3) activities in the southern
portion of the study area.
Under Alternative 4, the Sailing Lagoon and LWS staging areas would be used to provide access for mobilization,
soil stockpiling, parking, and equipment material storage for Year 2 activities in the northern portion of the site.
These activities would include inspection and irrigation of previously constructed channels, recontouring of the
existing channel, and removal of the LWS reserve fill. The California Avenue staging area would be used for
bank protection–related construction activities downstream of U.S. 50.

YEAR 3
Except for mobilization, revegetation, irrigation, and project shutdown during Year 4, project construction would
be completed during Year 3. Year 3 would also include continued inspection and irrigation of revegetation
treatments installed in Years 1 and 2.

Lagoon and dune restoration would continue during Year 3. Under Alternatives 1–3, the eastern end of the Sailing
Lagoon would be recontoured, and the lagoon connected to the river. Under Alternatives 1 and 2, fill would be
removed at East Barton beach to restore lagoon and the restored lagoon revegetated; at Barton Beach, dune swales
and ridges would be recontoured and revegetated. Under each of these alternatives, the Sailing Lagoon and LWS
staging areas would be used to stage equipment/materials for these activities.
Connecting points between the new and old channels would be graded, and under Alternatives 1–3, vertical and
lateral grade controls constructed. Water would be pumped into new and recontoured channel segments to pre-wet
margins and then flows would be redirected into the new channels. Fill would be placed in the old channel
sections to be abandoned. Under Alternatives 1–3, excavation would take place at the LWS Restoration Area and
the TKPOA Corporation Yard to provide materials for use in backfilling the existing channel, and these areas
would subsequently be recontoured. Permanent revegetation and temporary irrigation would be installed in all
work areas at final grade as soon as possible. For Alternatives 1–3, the LWS and Venice Drive staging areas
would serve as the primary areas for storage of equipment/materials and parking for these activities.
Under Alternatives 2 and 3, a stormwater treatment area would be constructed along the western edge of the
Upper Truckee River, adjacent to Venice Drive, and an additional treatment area would be constructed near
Colorado Avenue. The LWS and Venice Drive staging areas would serve these activities.
Public access and recreation infrastructure would be constructed during Year 3. Under Alternative 1, this would
include construction of the bridge and boardwalk running west to Cove East Beach; the kiosk, parking area, and
boat take-out near Venice Drive; and a trail system and viewpoints at the eastern margin of the meadow.
Alternative 2 would include construction of viewpoints and an ADA-accessible fishing platform. The Lily
Avenue, Bellevue Avenue, and Highland Woods staging areas would be used to serve construction activities on
the east side of the study area; the LWS and East Venice Drive staging areas would serve construction activities
on the west side of the study area.

YEAR 4
Under Alternatives 1–4, construction activities in Year 4 would consist of mobilization and maintenance of
roadway and staging areas, revegetation and irrigation, winterization, and project shutdown. Although some
ground disturbance would be associated with these activities, cut and fill of materials would not be substantial. All
work in Year 4 would utilize either the East Venice Drive (west) or Bellevue (east) staging areas.

2.7

ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENTS

Proposed project alternatives include environmental commitments listed in Table 2-6 to avoid or minimize
adverse effects on the environment. The environmental analysis assumes implementation of these commitments
prior to determination of environmental impacts. In some instances these environmental commitments were
insufficient to fully avoid potential impacts, therefore, mitigation measures are proposed when feasible.
To document fulfillment of these commitments, the Conservancy will prepare an Environmental Commitments
Record (ECR). The ECR will contain a summary of required permits and environmental commitments that must
be incorporated into the project. This summary will be completed on approval of this environmental document.
The ECR also will record when required actions are taken, and changes and additions to environmental
commitments or permit conditions made during construction. After project construction, the Conservancy will
maintain a record of the completed ECR.

Table 2-6
Environmental Commitments of the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project
Environmental Commitment 1: Reduce the Generation of Construction-Related Emissions of ROG, NOX, and PM10.
In accordance with the TRPA Code of Ordinances, the Conservancy will implement the following measures to reduce the
emission of ROG, NOX, and PM10 during construction:
►
The Conservancy will obtain all necessary TRPA permits and approvals and will follow all required TRPA codes and
procedures with respect to BMPs (TRPA Code Section 60.4 ), project grading (TRPA Code Section 33.3), excavation,
and construction-related emissions-generating activities (TRPA Code Section 65.1: Air Quality Control).
►
The Conservancy will obtain all necessary El Dorado County permits and approvals and will follow all required County
laws and procedures with respect to BMPs, project grading excavation, and construction-related emissions-generating
activities.
►
Activities disturbing the soil will occur between October 15 and May 1 of each year, unless approval has been granted
by TRPA and Lahontan RWQCB. All construction sites will be winterized before October 15 of each construction year
in accordance with the provisions of Section 33.3.1.D of the TRPA Code of Ordinances and the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit.
►
Dust control measures will be required for any grading activity creating substantial quantities of dust. Dust control
measures will be approved by TRPA before groundbreaking and will comply with the provisions of Section 33.3.3 of
the TRPA Code of Ordinances.
Environmental Commitment 2: Prepare and Implement a Cultural Resources Protection Plan. Before construction
begins, a cultural resource protection plan will be prepared and implemented before and during construction. Measures will
include, but are not limited to assuring final design placement and orientation of recreation infrastructure will incorporate
visual screening or barriers as appropriate to minimize visibility and access which could otherwise lead to damage or
destruction of prehistoric site CA-Eld-26; installing barriers or fencing during construction to protect identified sites,
including CA-Eld-26; jobsite education on protocol to identify potential uncovered resources and response (stop work)
protocol; and presence of a qualified cultural resource specialist to oversee grading activities that are in the vicinity of
eligible resources, including initial grading activities within the vicinity of the bluff and CA-Eld-26. Before project-related
ground disturbance begins, the Conservancy will train all construction personnel regarding the possibility of uncovering
buried cultural resources. The Conservancy will retain a qualified cultural resources specialist to educate personnel as to
how to identify prehistoric and historic-era archaeological remains. If unusual amounts of stone, bone, or shell or significant
quantities of historic-era artifacts such as glass, ceramic, metal, or building remains are uncovered during construction
activities, work in the vicinity of the specific construction site at which the suspected resources have been uncovered will be
suspended, and the Conservancy will be contacted immediately. At that time, the Conservancy will retain a qualified
professional archaeologist, who will conduct a field investigation of the specific site and recommend measures deemed
necessary to protect or recover any cultural resources concluded by the archaeologist to represent significant or potentially
significant resources as defined by CEQA, NEPA, and TRPA. These measures may include but will not necessarily be
limited to avoidance, archival research, subsurface testing, and excavation of contiguous block units. Conservancy will
implement the measures deemed necessary by the archaeologist before construction resumes within the area of the find. The
purpose of this oversight will be to ensure that cultural resources potentially uncovered during ground-disturbing activities
are identified, evaluated for significance, and treated in accordance with their possible National Register of Historical Places
(NRHP) and California Register of Historical Resources (CRHR) status. Potential treatment methods for significant and
potentially significant resources may include but will not be limited to taking no action (i.e., resources determined not to be
significant), avoiding the resource by changing construction methods or project design, and implementing a program of
testing and data recovery, in accordance with all applicable Federal and State requirements.
Environmental Commitment 3: Stop Work Within an Appropriate Radius Around the Discovered Human Remains,
Notify the El Dorado County Coroner and the Most Likely Descendants, and Treat Remains in Accordance With
State and Federal Law. In accordance with Section 7050.5(b) of the California Health and Safety Code, if human remains
are uncovered during ground-disturbing activities, the contractor and/or the Conservancy will immediately halt potentially
damaging excavation in the area of the burial and notify the El Dorado County Coroner and a professional archaeologist to
determine the nature of the remains. The coroner will examine all discoveries of human remains within 48 hours of
receiving notice of the discovery. If the coroner determines that the remains are those of a Native American, he or she will
contact the Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC) by phone within 24 hours of making that determination
(California Health and Safety Code, Section 7050[c]). Following the coroner’s findings, the Conservancy, an archaeologist,
and the NAHC-designated Most Likely Descendant (MLD) will determine the ultimate treatment and disposition of the
remains and take appropriate steps to ensure that additional human interments are not disturbed. The responsibilities for

Environmental Commitments of the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project
acting upon notification of a discovery of Native American human remains are identified in California Public Resources
Code (PRC) Section 5097.9.
Upon the discovery of Native American remains, the Conservancy will ensure that the immediate vicinity (according to
generally accepted cultural or archaeological standards and practices) is not damaged or disturbed by further development
activity until consultation with the MLD has taken place. The MLD will have 48 hours after being granted access to the site
to complete a site inspection and make recommendations. A range of possible treatments for the remains, including
nondestructive removal and analysis, preservation in place, relinquishment of the remains and associated items to the
descendants, or other culturally appropriate treatment may be discussed. California PRC Section 5097.9 suggests that the
concerned parties may extend discussions beyond the initial 48 hours to allow for the discovery of additional remains. The
following are site protection measures that the Conservancy will employ:
►
Record the site with the NAHC or the appropriate Information Center of the California Historical Resources
Information System.
►
Utilize an open-space or conservation zoning designation or easement.
►
Record a document with El Dorado County.
The Conservancy or its authorized representative will rebury the Native American human remains and associated grave
goods with appropriate dignity on the property in a location not subject to further subsurface disturbance if the NAHC is
unable to identify a MLD or if the MLD fails to make a recommendation within 48 hours after being granted access to the
site. The Conservancy or its authorized representative may also reinter the remains in a location not subject to further
disturbance if it rejects the recommendation of the MLD and mediation by the NAHC fails to provide measures acceptable
to the Conservancy.
Environmental Commitment 4: Prepare and Implement an Invasive Species Management Plan. In consultation with
TRPA and other relevant agencies, the Conservancy will prepare an Invasive Species Management Plan to address existing and
potential terrestrial and aquatic invasive species. The plan will specifically address Eurasian watermilfoil as it is known to be
present in the study area and is a species of particular concern. The plan will be divided into two sections: one addressing
terrestrial species and the other addressing aquatic. The aquatic portion will be consistent with the State of California’s Aquatic
Species Management Plan (CDFG 2008), and will be completed, reviewed, and approved by the California Department of
Fish and Game (CDFG) prior to initiation of construction. The plan will address how the project will address invasive
species currently in the project area in addition to how the project will prevent introducing new species.
The following will be part of the plan to address both invasive aquatic and terrestrial species:
►
A qualified biologist with experience in the Tahoe Basin will conduct a preconstruction survey to assess current
populations of invasive plants in the project area. Invasive species presence will be documented, and an action plan in
the context of the project will be developed to remove them prior to construction and/or prevent their spread due to
construction activities. Control measures may include herbicide application, hand removal, or other mechanical control.
►
All equipment entering the study area from areas infested by invasive plants or areas of unknown infestation status will
be cleaned of all attached soil or plant parts before being allowed into the study area All motorized and non-motorized
equipment used for in-channel work will be thoroughly cleaned prior to use on the project site and then be cleaned
before leaving the site. This includes waders, nets, seines, water quality monitoring equipment, boats, kayaks, life
jackets, and construction vehicles.
►
To reduce the import of seed or other materials potentially containing invasive plants, the project will use on-site
sources of seed and materials to the extent practicable. Seed, soil amendment, and erosion control materials that need to
be imported to the study area will be certified weed-free or will be obtained from a site documented as uninfested by
invasive plants.
►
With regard to aquatic invasive species, habitat within construction sites with aquatic invasive species will be isolated
prior to in-channel work. A qualified biologist(s) with expertise in Tahoe Basin aquatic plant and animal species will be
present during construction and will supervise the removal and disposal of non-native invasive species from the project
area. All biologists working on this program will be qualified to conduct non-native aquatic species removal/disposal in
a manner that avoids and/or minimizes all potential risks to native aquatic species, particularly any special status
species potentially encountered. Biologists will be on site when work sites are isolated and/or dewatered, if necessary,
in order to capture, handle, and safely remove or dispose of any non-native aquatic invasive species encountered. This
program will be closely coordinated with the Aquatic Species Rescue and Relocation Program, described below as
Environmental Commitment 7.

Environmental Commitments of the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project
After project construction, the project site will be annually monitored for occurrence of invasive plants for four years. If
invasive plants are documented during monitoring, they will be treated and eradicated to prevent further spread.
Environmental Commitment 5: Prepare and Implement Effective Construction Site Management Plans to Minimize
Risks of Water Quality Degradation and Impacts to Vegetation. Permits and approvals from several entities
(e.g., TRPA, Lahontan RWQCB, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), CDFG, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(USFWS), and CSLT) will impose conditions and requirements to minimize construction risks of water quality and
vegetation degradation. The Conservancy will develop and implement several site management plans as part of various
permit and approval requirements, including but not limited to a grading and erosion control plan, a dewatering and channel
seasoning plan, a diversion plan, a winterization plan, and a monitoring and construction management plan. The following
measures will be implemented by the Conservancy and their contractor within these plans to be developed for specific
permits or as independent measures:
►
Restrict the area and duration of construction disturbance to the absolute minimum necessary to accomplish work.
Protect existing vegetation outside construction area and salvage and re-use riparian vegetation where it needs to be
disturbed.
►
Design, install, and maintain temporary BMPs to protect disturbed areas and minimize soil erosion, prevent surface
runoff interaction with disturbed surfaces, and limit the potential for release of sediment to surface water bodies for
storm events up to the 20-year precipitation event.
►
Design, install, and maintain internally draining construction area(s) within the study area to prevent discharge of
untreated stormwater into surface water bodies. Anticipate runoff from adjacent lands and reroute it around the
construction zone.
►
Salvage topsoil to be reused on-site during project-related grading.
►
Provide winterization that isolates and protects disturbed areas from high streamflow on the Upper Truckee River and
Trout Creek (up to the 50-year event).
►
Secure a source of transportation and a location for deposition and/or storage of all excavated and imported materials at
the project site and minimize use of nonlocal materials and importation of materials from off-site.
►
Protect stockpiled and transported materials or debris from wind or water erosion. Store soil and other loose material at
least 100 feet from the active channel during the construction season. Designate staging areas and haul routes in
existing developed or disturbed areas where feasible, and where not feasible, in the least sensitive natural areas feasible.
►
Flag and/or fence boundaries of staging areas, haul routes, and construction sites.
►
Restrict the placement of materials or equipment to designated staging areas or construction sites and prohibit the use
of vehicles off of roads and haul routes.
►
Minimize overwinter storage of materials, vehicles, equipment, or debris within the 100-year floodplain.
►
Provide site-specific and reachwide dewatering/diversion plans that indicate the scheduling approach and/or maximum
diverted flows to minimize risks from summer thunderstorms, specific diversion/bypass/ dewatering methods and
equipment, defined work areas and diversion locations, the types and locations of temporary BMPs for the diversions
and reintroduction points, measures and options for treating turbid water before release back to the channel, and stated
water quality performance standards.
►
Salvage and reuse plant materials to the extent practicable.
►
Avoid fertilizer application to revegetated areas.
►
Provide flushing flows before activation of new and reconnected river channel sections based on a “channel seasoning”
plan that indicates the water source(s); volumes and duration required; phased placement of clean, washed gravels; and
the measures and options for treating potentially turbid water.
►
Require all contractors to develop Spill Prevention Plans (SPP) and Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plans (SWPPP).
These plans will contain BMPs to be implemented to minimize the risk of sedimentation, turbidity, and hazardous
material spills. Applicable BMPs may include permanent and temporary erosion control measures, including the use of
straw bales, mulch or wattles, silt fences, filter fabric, spill remediation material such as absorbent booms, proper
staging of fuel, out of channel equipment maintenance, and ultimately seeding and revegetating. Preventing
contaminants from entering the river during construction and operation of the project will protect water quality and the
aquatic habitat.

Environmental Commitments of the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project
Maintain the effectiveness of temporary erosion control, stormwater facilities, and flood flow protections throughout the
construction area. Monitor the status and effectiveness of temporary erosion control, stormwater facilities, and flood flow
protections throughout the construction area, including each of the internally draining zones that could separately discharge
to various surface water bodies. Monitor turbidity upstream of the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek, and where
feasible, downstream of the construction zone. Monitoring will be conducted by qualified personnel on a regular basis
during summer construction and on an event basis when runoff equals or exceeds the BMP design standards. Document
failures and/or threats of BMP failures, and identify remedial measures implementation. Repair BMP failures within 24
hours of documentation.
Environmental Commitment 6: Obtain and Comply with Federal, State, Regional, and Local Permits. The
Conservancy and its contractor will obtain and comply with the terms and conditions of all permits required by applicable
federal, state, regional, and local statutes and regulations. The anticipated compliance, consultation, and coordination are
described in Chapter 5.
Environmental Commitment 7: Prepare and Implement an Aquatic Species Rescue and Relocation Plan. The
Conservancy will prepare and implement an Aquatic Species Rescue and Relocation Plan to reduce the direct loss of native
fish or desired sport (trout) and native mussels from impacts associated with construction of the project. The objective of the
rescue and relocation effort is to reduce harm and avoid potential mortality of important aquatic species, especially sensitive
fish species and mussels, which may be present within the project area. The plan will be completed, reviewed, and approved
by both CDFG and USFWS (for Lahontan cutthroat trout) prior to initiation of construction.
Aquatic habitat within work areas will be isolated (using block nets, silt curtains, or coffer dams) prior to in-channel work.
A qualified biologist with expertise in Tahoe Basin aquatic species, including the collection, handling, and relocating of fish
and freshwater mussels, habitat relationships, and biological monitoring of Tahoe Basin fish species will supervise the fish
and mussel rescue and relocation program for the project. All biologists working on the fish rescue and recovery program
will be qualified to conduct fish and mussel collections in a manner that minimizes all potential risks to collected animals,
particularly any special status species potentially encountered.
Aquatic organisms isolated within the work area(s) will be removed by hand, seine netting, or, if necessary, electrofishing.
Partial dewatering of the site will facilitate removal of aquatic species, but dewatering should not expose or strand
individuals to be rescued, and water temperature and dissolved oxygen levels should be monitored to maintain levels
supporting the most sensitive species. Should western pearlshell mussels be found in the site, the mussels shall be removed
prior to fish rescues to minimize injury from foot traffic or electrofishing. Mussels can be located and removed by hand in
wadeable streams; snorkeling and hand removal may be needed in deeper water. If electrofishing is necessary, it will be
performed by qualified biologists and conducted according to established guidelines provided by CDFG and USFWS.
Biologists will be on site when work sites are isolated and/or dewatered, in order to capture, handle, and safely relocate
sensitive fish species (i.e. Lahontan cutthroat trout and western pearlshell mussels). Appropriate rescue methods should
consider both general (low conductive water) and site-specific conditions (substrate, bed morphology).
All captured native fish and mussels will be relocated, as soon as possible, to another Upper Truckee River site that has
been pre-approved by CDFG and USFWS and/or USFS biologists, and in which suitable habitat conditions are present.
All captured invasive fishes (e.g., bluegill, bass, and catfish) or aquatic invasive plants will be disposed of, consistent with
the approved EC 4: Prepare and Implement an Invasive Species Management Plan, described above.
Environmental Commitment 8: Prepare a Final Geotechnical Engineering Report, and Implement All Applicable
Recommendations. Before construction begins, the Conservancy will obtain the services of a licensed geotechnical
engineer to prepare a final geotechnical engineering report for the project. The final geotechnical engineering report will
address and make recommendations on the following as necessary:
►
structural/seismic design of bridges;
►
site preparation;
►
appropriate sources and types of fill;
►
potential need for soil amendments;
►
access roads, pavement, and asphalt areas;
►
shallow groundwater table; and
►
soil and slope stability.

In addition to the recommendations for the conditions listed above, the geotechnical investigation will include subsurface
testing of soil and groundwater conditions for proposed project elements and will determine appropriate bulkhead and levee
and bridge foundation designs that are consistent with City code requirements. All recommendations contained in the final
geotechnical engineering report will be implemented by the Conservancy. Special recommendations contained in the
geotechnical engineering report will be noted on the grading plans and implemented as appropriate before construction
begins. Design and construction of all phases of the project will be in accordance with current City code requirements at the
time of construction.
Environmental Commitment 9: Develop and Implement a Construction Management Program. The Conservancy and
its contractor will develop a construction management program to avoid or minimize potential impacts to health and safety
during project construction, to the extent feasible. The construction management program will inform contractors and
subcontractors of work hours, modes and locations of transportation and parking for construction workers, location of
overhead and underground utilities, worker health and safety, truck routes, stockpiling and staging procedures, public access
routes, the terms and conditions of all project permits and approvals; and the health and safety plan (HASP) information
described below.
The Conservancy and its contractor will develop and implement a HASP that clearly notifies all workers of the potential to
encounter hazardous materials during demolition and construction activities. The HASP will identify proper handling and
disposal procedures for contaminants expected to be on-site as well as maps and phone numbers for local hospitals and
other emergency contacts. All protocols outlined in the HASP will be complied with throughout project implementation.
Any stored hazardous materials present in the study area will be removed and disposed at appropriately permitted locations,
as appropriate.
The HASP shall describe fire prevention and response methods, including fire precaution, prevention, and suppression
methods that are consistent with the policies and standards in South Lake Tahoe. The plan shall include a requirement that
all construction equipment must be equipped with spark arrestors. All construction personnel shall be made familiar with
the contents of the plan before the start of construction activities. A copy of the plan shall be posted in the trailer used by the
on-site construction superintendent.
The HASP would also include construction notification procedures for CSLT police, public works, and fire department and
schools within one-quarter mile prior to construction activities. As required by Public Resource Code Section 21151.4, the
Conservancy shall provide written notification of the project to the Lake Tahoe Unified School District at least 30 days
before certification of the EIR/EIS/EIS and shall consult with the school district regarding proper handling and disposal
methods associated with substances subject to California Health and Safety Code Section 25532. Notices would also be
distributed to neighboring property owners, local agencies, and public works, police, and fire departments, and the Lake
Tahoe Unified School District.
Environmental Commitment 10: Establish and Implement a Management Agreement with the El Dorado County
Vector Control District. The Conservancy will establish and implement a management agreement with the El Dorado
County Vector Control District (EDCVCD) to adequately control mosquito populations in the study area. As a performance
criterion for the management agreement, the terms and conditions of the agreement will be designed to ensure that
EDCVCD can maintain mosquito abundance at or below pre-project levels. The agreement will include, but not be limited
to, the following:
►
measures that ensure necessary access for monitoring and control measures;
►
EDCVCD review of project plans and provision of recommendations for management of mosquito populations; and
►
applicable best management practices from the California Department of Public Health’s Best Management Practices
for Mosquito Control on California State Properties (CDPH 2008), including
• procedures for coordinating Conservancy and EDCVCD management activities, and
• providing public information for visitors and the community regarding control measures being implemented, the
risk of transmission of mosquito-borne disease, and personal protective measures.

Environmental Commitment 11: Incorporate Effective Permanent Stormwater Best Management Practices.
The Conservancy shall ensure that the final design of all recreation features with impervious or partially pervious surfaces
will incorporate effective permanent BMPs for the protection of water quality and will conform with all applicable
ordinances and standard conditions established by TRPA and Lahontan RWQCB. At a minimum, the stormwater design
will:
►
minimize the area of disturbance and coverage for all permanent features;
►
maximize the use of porous media (e.g., porous pavement, decomposed granite fill) for trail surfaces;
►
optimize trail slopes for proper drainage;
►
provide for at-the-source infiltration of roof or other cover runoff; and
►
provide for collection of runoff from impervious pavements and direct the runoff through oil/water separator(s) and
advance treatment prior to discharge to Stream Environment Zones (SEZs).
Environmental Commitment 12: Prepare and Implement Traffic Control Plans. To ensure consistency with City Code
26-16 and state safety orders, rules, and regulations of the Division of Industrial Safety, the Conservancy will prepare and
implement traffic control plans for construction activities that may encroach on CSLT and California State road rights-of­
way. The traffic control plans will follow California Department of Transportation’s (Caltrans) Standard Plans, Standard
Special Provisions, and Non-Standard Special Provisions for Temporary Traffic Control Systems and will be signed by a
professional engineer. Measures typically used in traffic control plans include advertising of planned lane closures, warning
signage, a flag person to direct traffic flows when needed, and methods to ensure continued access by emergency vehicles.
During project construction, access to existing land uses will be maintained at all times, with detours used as necessary
during road closures. Traffic control plans will be submitted to the CSLT Public Works Department for review and approval
before construction of project phases whose implementation may cause encroachment on CSLT or California State road
rights-of-way. The Traffic Control Plan will address safety conflicts between construction traffic and of local traffic,
pedestrians, and bicyclists. The plan will include advance public advisories, construction-period signage, flag personnel,
and other special traffic-control actions as necessary. Specific measures contained in the plan include the following.
►
Distribute or mail flyers to residents in the nearby Al Tahoe, Highlands Woods, and Tahoe Keys subdivisions advising
about upcoming project traffic prior to the initiation of construction.
►
Place advisory signs along construction routes in advance of construction to alert traffic, pedestrian, and bicyclists
about the upcoming construction traffic activity.
►
Install construction area signage on designated haul routes to inform the public of the presence of trucks.
►
Provide flag personnel at when truck activity is heavy (i.e., more than ten trucks per hour).
►
Provide information to all truck drivers identifying haul routes, speed limits, location of flaggers, and any other
pertinent public safety information.
►
Monitor truck and traffic conditions to identify traffic congestion, safety concerns regarding truck, vehicle, and
pedestrian and bicycle conflicts and adjust management approach as needed.
Environmental Commitment 13: Prepare and Implement a Public Outreach Plan. The Conservancy will prepare a
Public Outreach Plan (POP) to inform the general public and partnering agencies, such as the CSLT, El Dorado County
Vector Control, and El Dorado County Animal Control, of construction-related activities within the Project Area. Further,
in consultation with the construction contractor, every effort will be made to maintain access to and within the Study Area,
including trail access to Lake Tahoe, insofar as the public’s health and safety can be assured. There may be periods of time
when it is deemed unsafe for the public to be within the study area and/or on trails to the lake during certain construction
activities. These periods of restricted access are alternative and construction season dependent.
The POP will include strategies to inform the general public and partnering agencies of access restrictions and their
anticipated timelines, alternate locations for passive recreation activities, and site access information. Communication of
this information may be through signage at access points, messages posted to the Conservancy website, and Public Service
Announcements and news articles in the local and regional newspapers, online and in print.

efficient vessel navigation during construction at the junction of the Sailing Lagoon and the adjacent channel of the Tahoe
Keys Marina and within all accessible reaches of the Upper Truckee River within the project area. The plan will include
vessel (motorized and unmotorized) traffic control measures to minimize congestion and navigation hazards to the extent
feasible. Construction areas in the waterway will be barricaded or guarded by readily visible barriers, or other effective
means to warn boaters of their presence and restrict access. Warning devices and signage will be consistent with the
California Uniform State Marking System and effective during non-daylight hours and periods of dense fog.
The Conservancy will maintain safe boat access to public launch and docking facilities, businesses, and residences of the
Tahoe Keys Marina and will minimize the partial closure of the waterway. Where temporary channel closure is necessary, a
temporary channel closure plan shall be developed. The waterway closure plan shall include procedures for notification of
the temporary closure to the United States Coast Guard, boating organizations, Tahoe Keys Marina, boat/kayak rental
businesses within the area, and all other effective means of notifying boaters.

AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT AND
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

Organized by environmental resource category, Chapter 3 of this EIR/EIS/EIS describes the affected environment
(regulatory and environmental settings) in the study area and analyzes the environmental consequences of the
project. Both direct and indirect impacts are evaluated and mitigation measures are provided to reduce or avoid
potentially significant impacts associated with implementation of the alternatives. Section 3.18 describes
cumulative impacts and mitigation measures for all resource categories. The relationship of project consequences
to TRPA environmental carrying capacity thresholds (thresholds) is described in Section 4.5, “Consequences for
Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities.”

3.1
3.1.1

APPROACH TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
CEQA, NEPA, AND TRPA REQUIREMENTS

The State CEQA Guidelines explain that the environmental analysis for an EIR must evaluate impacts associated
with the project and identify mitigation for any potentially significant impacts. All phases of a proposed project,
including development and operation, are evaluated in the analysis. Section 15126.2(a) of the State CEQA
Guidelines states:
An EIR shall identify and focus on the significant environmental effects of the proposed project. In
assessing the impact of a proposed project on the environment, the lead agency should normally limit
its examination to changes in the existing physical conditions in the affected area as they exist at the
time the notice of preparation is published, or where no notice of preparation is published, at the time
environmental analysis is commenced. Direct and indirect significant effects of the project on the
environment shall be clearly identified and described, giving due consideration to both the short-term
and long-term effects. The discussion should include relevant specifics of the area, the resources
involved, physical changes, alterations to ecological systems, and changes induced in population
distribution, population concentration, and human use of the land (including commercial and
residential development), health and safety problems caused by the physical changes, and other
aspects of the resource base such as water, historical resources, scenic quality, and public services.
The EIR shall also analyze any significant environmental effects the project might cause by bringing
development and people into the area affected.
An EIR must also discuss inconsistencies between the proposed project and applicable general plans and regional
plans (State CEQA Guidelines, Section 15125[d]).
An EIR must describe any feasible measures that could minimize significant adverse impacts, and the measures
are to be fully enforceable through permit conditions, agreements, or other legally binding instruments (State
CEQA Guidelines, Section 15126.4[a]). Mitigation measures are not required for effects that are found to be less
than significant.
The Council on Environmental Quality’s regulations for implementing NEPA specify that a federal agency
preparing an EIS must consider the effects of the alternatives on the environment; these include effects on
ecological, aesthetic, historical, and cultural resources and economic, social, and health effects. Environmental
effects include direct, indirect, and cumulative effects (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 1508.8). An EIS
must also discuss all of the following (40 CFR 1502.16):
►

possible conflicts with the objectives of federal, state, regional, and local land use plans, policies, or controls
for the area concerned;

Approach to the Environmental Analysis

►

energy requirements and conservation potential;

►

urban quality;

►

the relationship between short-term uses of the environment and long-term productivity; and

►

irreversible or irretrievable commitments of resources.

In addition, an EIS must identify relevant, reasonable mitigation measures that are not already included in the
proposed action or alternatives that could avoid, minimize, rectify, reduce, eliminate, or compensate for the
project’s adverse environmental effects (40 CFR 1502.14).
The TRPA Code of Ordinances states that an EIS shall identify significant environmental impacts of the proposed
project, any significant adverse environmental effects that cannot be avoided should the project be implemented,
and mitigation measures that must be implemented to assure that regional standards are met (TRPA Code of
Ordinances, Section 3.7.2). In assessing the impact of a proposed project on the natural and social environment,
the lead agency should evaluate the relationship between local short-term uses of the human environment and the
maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity as well as any significant irreversible and irretrievable
commitments of resources that would be involved if the proposed project were implemented. The EIS shall also
evaluate growth-inducing impacts of the proposed project.
The TRPA Code of Ordinances also requires findings regarding the effects on environmental carrying capacity
thresholds (thresholds). Thresholds are used by TRPA to set environmental goals and standards for the Tahoe
Basin. To approve a project, TRPA must find that the project will not cause any threshold to be exceeded (TRPA
Code of Ordinances, Section 4.4.1.B). Therefore, a discussion of the effect of each alternative on all thresholds is
also included in this EIR/EIS/EIS.
The following discussions present the organization and general assumptions used in the environmental analysis
contained in this EIR/EIS/EIS. The reader is referred to the individual technical sections regarding specific
assumptions, methodology, and significance criteria used in the analysis.

The content of Sections 3.2 through 3.17 is described below.

CONTENT OF SECTIONS 3.2 THROUGH 3.17
Sections 3.2 through 3.17 follow the same general format with two subsections: “Affected Environment” and
“Environmental Consequences.”
Affected Environment
“Affected Environment” consists of two subsections, “Regulatory Setting” and “Environmental Setting,” which
include the following information:
►

“Regulatory Setting” identifies the adopted plans, policies, laws, and regulations that are relevant to each
topical section. As noted above, the EIR/EIS/EIS needs to address possible conflicts between alternatives and
the objectives of formally adopted federal, state, regional, or local land use plans, policies, or controls for the
area. Therefore, this subsection summarizes or lists the potentially relevant policies and objectives of the City
of South Lake Tahoe General Plan, El Dorado County General Plan, Lake Tahoe Airport Comprehensive
Land Use Plan, and Lake Tahoe Regional Plan.
In particular, TRPA’s Regional Plan for the Lake Tahoe Basin (Regional Plan) includes goals, policies, and
ordinances that are relevant to most issue areas. The Regional Plan consists of the following documents:
environmental threshold carrying capacities (adopted in 1982 and evaluated every 5 years since 1991), Goals
and Policies (September 1986), Regional Transportation Plan—Air Quality Plan (1992), Water Quality
Management Plan (1988), Scenic Quality Improvement Program (1989), Plan Area Statements (August 1987
and updated), and Code of Ordinances (adopted November 15, 2011, effective March 1, 2012). The Regional
Plan, adopted in 1987, had a 20-year scope. The plan is currently being reviewed and updated through a
collaborative effort among TRPA, USFS, the Lahontan RWQCB, and the Nevada Division of Environmental
Protection. These agencies are working together to update several important environmental documents for the
Tahoe Basin. Until a Regional Plan Update is adopted by the TRPA Governing Board, the 1987 Regional
Plan remains in effect.

►

“Environmental Setting” provides an overview of the existing physical environmental conditions in the area
that could be affected by implementation of the alternatives (i.e., the “affected environment”) in accordance
with Section 15125 of the State CEQA Guidelines and NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1502.15).

Environmental Consequences and Mitigation Measures
“Environmental Consequences and Mitigation Measures” discusses the impacts of the proposed alternatives
(including environmental commitments listed in Table 2-6) on the environment, in accordance with Sections
15125 and 15143 of the State CEQA Guidelines, NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1502.16), and Section 3.7.2.C of
TRPA’s Code of Ordinances, which requires identification of significant unavoidable impacts, and with Section
3.7.4 of TRPA’s Code of Ordinances, which calls for “required findings” in conjunction with the identification of
significant unavoidable impacts.
The “Environmental Consequences and Mitigation Measures” section also provides mitigation measures to reduce
significant and potentially significant effects of the project alternatives to the extent feasible. (Mitigation
measures are not required for impacts identified under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative because no project
would be approved; additionally, no permits or authorizations would be required for the No-Project/No-Action
Alternative.) The mitigation measures are numbered to correspond with the impact addressed by the mitigation
measure.
This section also describes whether mitigation measures would fully reduce each alternative’s impacts to lessthan-significant levels. It is organized into three subsections:

Significance Criteria
Methods and Assumptions
Impact Analysis and Mitigation Measures

These subsections are described further below.
Significance Criteria
“Significance Criteria” provides the criteria used in this document to define the level at which an impact would be
considered significant in accordance with CEQA and NEPA. Significance criteria used in this EIR/EIS/EIS are
listed separately for CEQA, NEPA, and TRPA analyses. CEQA criteria are based on the checklist presented in
Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines, as amended; factual or scientific information and data; professional
standards; and regulatory standards of federal, state, and local agencies. For most issue areas, NEPA criteria are
based on the CEQA criteria. These criteria also encompass the factors taken into account under NEPA to
determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects. TRPA Criteria are
based on the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist; factual or scientific information and data; professional
standards; and regulatory standards of federal, state, and local agencies. Significance criteria are given an
alphanumeric code used to identify the relationship between significance criteria and specific impacts.
Effects on TRPA thresholds are also considered. The alternative’s effects on TRPA thresholds are described in
Section 4.6, “Consequences for Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities.”
Methods and Assumptions
“Methods and Assumptions” describes the methods, process, procedures, and/or assumptions used to formulate
and conduct the impact analysis. All assessments of environmental effects assumed that construction and
operation of any alternative would comply with relevant federal, state, regional, and local ordinances and
regulations, and applied existing and available information for the study area and vicinity.
An important consideration in evaluating long-term effects of the alternatives is the extent to which the number of
visitors to the study area would be altered. Implementing any of the action alternatives would likely increase use of
the study area. However, the size of this increase would be proportional to the change in the type and amount of
public access and recreation-related infrastructure: Implementing Alternative 2 (minimal recreation infrastructure)
would result in only a very slight increase in the number of visitors, and implementing Alternative 1 (maximum
recreation infrastructure) would result in the greatest increase. Implementing Alternative 3 or 4 (moderate recreation
infrastructure) would result in an intermediate increase. In addition to the type and amount of public access and
recreation-related infrastructure, greater connectivity of facilities (both in the study area and to adjacent facilities and
access points) would likely increase use of the study area; Alternative 1 would provide connection between the
Tahoe Keys Marina area and the Al Tahoe neighborhoods. Factors limiting the potential increase in visitors include
the following:
►

The recreation and public access elements of the alternatives are related to the existing use of the study area
for dispersed recreation, not to new uses. For example, existing trails support casual use by cyclists and
pedestrians, but not use by commuter or utilitarian cyclists and pedestrians, or by road cyclists; and the
proposed trails also would only support use by casual pedestrians and cyclists. Most of these elements are
intended to replace existing, user-created features and/or reduce the impacts of existing dispersed recreation.
For example, proposed pedestrian trails and bicycle paths follow the routes of or are intended to replace
existing, informal, user-created trails.

►

The most popular recreational uses of the study area are walking and running, beach use, wildlife viewing,
and fishing. The Tahoe Basin has an abundance of locations where people can engage in these activities; thus,
there is not a substantial unmet need for such recreational opportunities.

►

Adjacent neighborhoods account for a substantial portion of visitors to the study area, and implementing the
project would not alter the number of residents in adjacent neighborhoods.

►

The study area can already be accessed from the Upper Truckee River, a number of locations around its
perimeter, including from the lake, and trails already connect most portions of the study area.

Nonetheless, several aspects of the proposed public access elements could increase the number of visitors to the
study area. For example, several proposed public access elements would change the quality of trail surfaces,
which could increase trail use (in a manner analogous to the “maintenance” factor in the Tahoe Bike Trail User
Model [LSC Transportation Consultants 2009]). Thus, an increase in use is likely. Recent public use of the study
area is described in Section 3.13, “Recreation,” and information related to the numbers of visitors is provided in
Section 3.16, “Transportation, Parking, and Circulation.” Based on this information, and the considerations and
factors given above, potential increases in use under the alternatives are anticipated to result in less than 100
additional vehicle trips per day.
Effects Not Discussed Further in the EIR/EIS/EIS
This section lists effects related to specific impact criteria that are not discussed further in the EIR/EIS/EIS. For
each type of effect, the reason why the effect is not discussed further is provided (i.e., why no impact or only a
negligible effect could occur).
Impact Analysis and Mitigation Measures
“Impact Analysis and Mitigation Measures” discusses potential impacts, determines their significance, and
proposes mitigation measures to reduce or avoid potentially significant and significant impacts. Impacts are
organized into two categories: (1) project-level impacts, which include both direct and indirect impacts, and
(2) cumulative impacts. Direct impacts are those that are caused by the action and occur at the same time and
place. Indirect effects are reasonably foreseeable consequences that may occur at a later time or at a distance that
is removed from the study area, such as growth-inducing effects and other effects related to changes in land use
patterns, population density, or growth rate, and related effects on the physical environment. The duration of
direct and indirect impacts falls into the following categories:
►

temporary impacts would occur only during construction;

►

short-term impacts would begin during construction and last for three to five years; and

►

long-term impacts would last longer than five years, and in some cases, a long-term impact could be
considered a permanent impact.

A cumulative impact is an impact that would result from the incremental impact of the proposed action (i.e., the
alternative under consideration) added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable probable future actions.
Project-level direct and indirect impacts are analyzed in each resource category section; cumulative impacts are
discussed separately in Section 3.18.
The impacts of each alternative are listed numerically and sequentially throughout each section. Impacts are
numbered sequentially for Alternatives 1–5 in each section. For example, impacts in Section 3.3 are numbered
3.3-1 (Alt. 1), 3.3-2 (Alt. 1), 3.3-3 (Alt. 1), and so on for Alternative 1, and impacts in Section 3.3 for Alternative
2 are numbered 3.3-1 (Alt. 2), 3.3-2 (Alt. 2), 3.3-3 (Alt. 2), and so on. An alphanumeric code following the
impact’s title identifies the significance criteria to which it is related. An impact statement precedes the discussion
of each impact; this statement provides a summary of the impact and concludes with its level of significance in
bold font. The discussion that follows the impact statement includes the analysis on which a conclusion is based
regarding the level of impact. Impact conclusions are made using the significance criteria described above and
include consideration of the “context” of the action and the “intensity” (severity) of its effects in accordance with

NEPA guidance (40 CFR 1508.27). Effects and impacts as used in NEPA regulations are synonymous. Effects
includes ecological (such as the effects on natural resources and on the components, structures, and functioning of
affected ecosystems), aesthetic, historic, cultural, economic, social, or health, whether direct, indirect, or
cumulative. Effects may also include those resulting from actions which may have both beneficial and detrimental
effects, even if on balance the agency believes that the effect will be beneficial. Therefore, it is important to
discuss the context and severity of the effect.
The level of impact of the alternatives is determined by comparing estimated effects with baseline conditions.
Under CEQA, the environmental setting (as defined above) normally represents the baseline condition against
which significance is determined. Under NEPA, the No-Action Alternative (expected future conditions without
the project) is the baseline against which the effects of project alternatives are compared; existing conditions are
the baseline conditions against which the effects of the No-Action Alternative are compared.
Alternative-specific analyses are conducted to evaluate each potential impact on the existing environment.
This assessment also specifies why impacts are found to be less than significant, significant, potentially
significant, too speculative for meaningful consideration, or why there is no environmental impact or a beneficial
effect. A less-than-significant impact is one that would not result in a substantial adverse change in the physical
environment. A significant impact is defined for CEQA purposes as a substantial, or potentially substantial,
adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected by the project. For NEPA purposes, the
significance of effects is based on considerations of both context and intensity (i.e., severity) (40 CFR Section
1508.27), and effects include not only physical conditions but also economic and social conditions (40 CFR
Section 1508.8). These effects may be both detrimental and beneficial.
A potentially significant impact is one that, if it were to occur, would be considered a significant impact; however,
the occurrence of the impact is uncertain. A potentially significant impact is treated as if it were a significant
impact in terms of mitigation. An impact that is too speculative for meaningful consideration is one that has a
level of significance that is too uncertain to be reasonably determined. This is an impact for which the degree of
significance cannot be determined for specific reasons, such as because aspects of the impact itself are either
unpredictable, or the severity of the consequences cannot be known at this time.
Mitigation measures are presented where feasible to avoid, minimize, rectify, reduce, or compensate for
significant and potentially significant impacts, in accordance with the State CEQA Guidelines (CCR Section
15126.4), NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1508.20), and the TRPA Code of Ordinances (Section 3.7). Mitigation
measures are not proposed when the impact is determined to be less than significant. Each mitigation measure is
identified numerically to correspond with the number of the impact being mitigated by the measure, and if more
than one mitigation measure is identified for an impact they are identified alphabetically. For example, if Impact
3.3-1 (Alt. 1) were significant and had a single mitigation measure, Impact 3.3-2 (Alt. 1) were less than
significant, and Impact 3.3-3 (Alt. 1) were significant and had three mitigation measures, then the mitigation
measure for Impact 3.3-1 (Alt. 1) would be Mitigation Measure 3.3-1 (Alt. 1), and the mitigation measures for
Impact 3.3-3 would be 3.3-3a (Alt. 1), 3.3-3b (Alt. 1), and 3.3-3c (Alt. 1). Where sufficient feasible mitigation is
not available to fully reduce impacts to a less-than-significant level, the impacts are identified as remaining
“significant and unavoidable.”
Relationship to TRPA Environmental Carrying Capacity Thresholds
TRPA has established thresholds for water quality, air quality, scenic resources, soil conservation, fish habitat,
vegetation, wildlife habitat, noise, and recreation. The relationship of the consequences of the alternatives to the
TRPA environmental carrying capacity thresholds has been evaluated concurrently with the impact analysis, but
is presented in a consolidated discussion in Chapter 4, “Other Required Sections.”

Section 3.18, “Cumulative Effects,” is organized into the following sections:
►

►

“Definitions of Cumulative Impacts,” which defines cumulative effects under CEQA, NEPA, and TRPA;
“Cumulative Analysis Approach,” which provides the geographic extent of the cumulative effects analysis for
each resource category, planning context, and methods of the analysis (including significance criteria and a
description of related projects considered in the analysis); and
“Cumulative Impact Analysis,” which includes a subsection for each issue area, and within each subsection
discusses cumulative impacts, determines their significance, and proposes mitigation measures to avoid (or if
avoidance is not feasible, to minimize) potentially cumulatively significant effects.

3.1.3

ISSUES ELIMINATED FROM DETAILED ANALYSIS

The State CEQA Guidelines provide for the identification and elimination from detailed study the issues for
which no impacts would be significant or that have been covered by prior environmental review (California PRC,
Section 21002.1). The NEPA regulations provide similar provisions (40 CFR 1501.7[a][3]). A brief explanation
as to why impacts on each resource are not anticipated, as required by CEQA and NEPA, is provided below.
During initial scoping with the public and governmental agencies, and based on information obtained through
literature review, agency correspondence, consultations, and collection of field data, it was determined that the
following resources would not experience any potential environmental impacts resulting from any of the
alternatives and, accordingly, are not addressed further in this EIR/EIS/EIS:
►

agricultural resources, because no agricultural resources are in the study area, including Prime Farmland,
Unique Farmland, Farmland of Statewide Importance, or farmland under Williamson Act contracts (effects on
forest resources are discussed in Section 3.4, “Biological Resources: Vegetation and Wildlife”);

►

Indian trust assets, because no Indian trust assets are in the study area;

►

mineral resources, because there are no known mineral resources of value or delineated mineral resource
recovery sites in the study area;

►

school capacity, because no schools are present in the study area, and the alternatives would not affect school
capacity by increasing population directly by constructing residences or indirectly by constructing related
infrastructure (e.g., roads);

►

wastewater treatment facilities, because no wastewater facilities are present in the study area, and the
alternatives would not increase population (and thus demand for wastewater facilities) directly by
constructing residences or indirectly by constructing related infrastructure (e.g., roads); and

►

water supplies, because no water supply facilities are present in the study area, the alternatives would not
reduce the availability of water supplies, and the alternatives would not increase population (and thus demand
for water supplies) directly by constructing residences or indirectly by constructing related infrastructure (e.g.,
roads).

AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE

This section includes a description of existing air quality conditions in the study area and applicable air quality
regulations, and an analysis of potential short-term and long-term air quality impacts that could result from project
implementation. Mitigation measures are recommended as necessary to reduce potentially significant adverse air
quality impacts. Consistency with TRPA goals and policies is presented in Section 3.10, “Land Use,” Table
3.10-1. The project’s effects on thresholds are described in Section 4.5, “Consequences for Environmental
Threshold Carrying Capacities.” See Section 3.18, “Cumulative Impacts,” for a discussion of greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions and the potential project effects associated with global climate change.

3.2.1

AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

REGULATORY SETTING
The study area is located in the eastern portion of El Dorado County, California, within the Lake Tahoe Air Basin
(LTAB). Air quality within the El Dorado County portion of the LTAB is regulated by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), California Air Resources Board (ARB), TRPA, and the El Dorado County Air Quality
Management District (EDCAQMD). Each of these agencies develops rules, regulations, policies, and/or goals to
comply with applicable legislation. Although EPA regulations may not be superseded, state and local regulations
may be more stringent.
Federal
Federal Clean Air Act
EPA is charged with implementing national air quality programs. EPA’s air quality mandates are drawn primarily
from the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA), which was enacted in 1970. The most recent major amendments made by
Congress were in 1990. Relevant regulations for criteria and hazardous air pollutants are summarized separately
below.
Criteria Air Pollutants
The CAA required EPA to establish national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). As shown in Table 3.2-1,
EPA has established primary and secondary NAAQS for the following criteria air pollutants: ozone, carbon
monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), respirable and fine particulate matter (PM10 and
PM2.5, respectively), and lead. The primary standards protect the public health and the secondary standards protect
public welfare. The CAA also required each state to prepare an air quality control plan referred to as a state
implementation plan (SIP). The Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) added requirements for
states with nonattainment areas to revise their SIPs to incorporate additional control measures to reduce air
pollution. The SIP is modified periodically to reflect the latest emissions inventories, planning documents, and
rules and regulations of the air basins as reported by their jurisdictional agencies. EPA is responsible for
reviewing all state SIPs to determine whether they conform to the mandates of the CAA, and the amendments
thereof, and determine whether implementation will achieve air quality goals. If EPA determines a SIP to be
inadequate, a Federal implementation plan (FIP) that imposes additional control measures may be prepared for the
nonattainment area. If the state fails to submit an approvable SIP or to implement the plan within the mandated
time frame, sanctions may be applied to transportation funding and stationary air pollution sources in the air
basin. It is important to note, however, that because the study area would not be located in a nonattainment or
maintenance area with respect to any of the NAAQS, CAA conformity determination is not required for the
project.

a
California standards for ozone, SO2 (1- and 24-hour), NO2, particulate matter, and visibility-reducing particles are values that are not to be exceeded. All others are not to be equaled or
exceeded. California ambient air quality standards are listed in the Table of Standards in Section 70200 of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations.
b
Concentration expressed first in units in which it was issued. Equivalent units given in parentheses are based on a reference temperature of 25 degrees Celsius (°C) and a reference
pressure of 760 torr. Most measurements of air quality are to be corrected to a reference temperature of 25°C and a reference pressure of 760 torr; ppm in this table refers to ppm by
volume, or micromoles of pollutant per mole of gas.
c
National standards (other than ozone, particulate matter, and those based on annual averages or annual arithmetic means) are not to be exceeded more than once a year. The ozone
standard is attained when the fourth highest eight-hour concentration in a year, averaged over three years, is equal to or less than the standard. The PM10 24-hour standard is attained
when 99 percent of the daily concentrations, averaged over three years, are equal to or less than the standard. The PM2.5 24-hour standard is attained when 98 percent of the daily
concentrations, averaged over three years, are equal to or less than the standard. Contact the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for further clarification and current federal policies.
d
National Primary Standards: The levels of air quality necessary, with an adequate margin of safety, to protect the public health.
e
National Secondary Standards: The levels of air quality necessary to protect the public welfare from any known or anticipated adverse effects of a pollutant.
f
Applicable in the Lake Tahoe Air Basin.
g
On February 19, 2008, the Office of Administrative Law approved a new NO2 ambient air quality standard, which lowers the one-hour standard to 0.19 ppm and establishes a new
annual standard of 0.030 ppm. These changes became effective March 20, 2008.
h
ARB has identified lead and vinyl chloride as toxic air contaminants with no threshold of exposure for adverse health effects determined. These actions allow for the implementation of
control measures at levels below the ambient concentrations specified for these pollutants.
Sources: TRPA 2007a, ARB 2008a

Hazardous Air Pollutants
Federal air quality regulations also focus on hazardous air pollutants (HAP), or in California State parlance, toxic
air contaminants (TAC). In general, for those HAPs that may cause cancer, there is no concentration that does not
present some risk. In other words, there is no threshold level below which adverse health impacts may not be
expected to occur. (By contrast, acceptable levels of exposure can be determined and the ambient standards have
been established for criteria air pollutants [Table 3.2-1].) Instead, EPA and ARB regulate HAPs and TACs,
respectively, through statutes and regulations that generally require the use of the maximum available control
technology (MACT) or best available control technology for toxics (BACT) to limit emissions. These regulations,
in conjunction with additional rules set forth by EDCAQMD, establish the regulatory framework for TACs.
EPA has programs for identifying and regulating HAPs. Title III of the CAAA directed EPA to promulgate
national emissions standards for HAPs (NESHAP). The NESHAP for major sources of HAPs may differ from
those for area sources. Major sources are defined as stationary sources with potential to emit more than 10 tons
per year (TPY) of any HAP or more than 25 TPY of any combination of HAPs; all other sources are considered
area sources. The CAAA specified that emissions standards must be promulgated in two phases. In the first phase
(1992–2000), EPA developed technology-based emissions standards designed to produce the maximum
achievable reduction of emissions. These standards are generally referred to as requiring MACT. The standards
may be different for area sources, based on generally available control technology. In the second phase (2001–
2008), EPA is required to promulgate health risk–based emissions standards where deemed necessary to address
risks remaining after implementation of the technology-based NESHAP standards. These emission standards are
being implemented in a tiered approach that breaks the second phase into four subgroups. The first two went into
effect in November 2008 and the remaining two went into effect in 2009.
The CAAA also required EPA to issue vehicle or fuel standards containing reasonable requirements to control
toxic emissions of, a minimum, benzene and formaldehyde. Performance criteria were established to limit mobilesource emissions of toxics (benzene, formaldehyde, and 1,3-butadiene). In addition, Section 219 required the use
of reformulated gasoline in selected areas with the most severe ozone nonattainment conditions to further reduce
mobile-source emissions.
State
California Clean Air Act
ARB is the agency responsible for coordination and oversight of state and local air pollution control programs in
California and for implementing the California Clean Air Act (CCAA). The CCAA, which was adopted in 1988,
required ARB to establish California ambient air quality standards (CAAQS) (Table 3.2-1). ARB has established
CAAQS for sulfates, hydrogen sulfide, vinyl chloride, visibility-reducing particulate matter, and the criteria air
pollutants mentioned above. In most cases, the CAAQS are more stringent than the NAAQS. Differences in the
standards are generally explained by the health-effects studies considered during the standard-setting process and
the interpretation of those studies. In addition, the CAAQS incorporate a margin of safety to protect sensitive
individuals.
The CCAA requires that all local air districts in the state endeavor to achieve and maintain the CAAQS by the
earliest practical date. The act specifies that local air districts should focus particular attention on reducing the
emissions from transportation and areawide emission sources, and authorizes districts to regulate indirect sources.
Among ARB’s other responsibilities are overseeing local air districts’ compliance with federal and California
laws, approving local air quality plans, submitting SIPs to EPA, monitoring air quality, determining and updating
area designations and maps, and setting emissions standards for new mobile sources, consumer products, small
utility engines, off-road vehicles, and fuels. California has 15 nonattainment areas for the national ozone standard
and two nonattainment areas for the PM2.5 standard. California’s SIP must show how each area will attain the

federal standards. To do this, the SIP will identify the amount by which pollutant emissions must be reduced in
each area to meet the standard and the emissions controls needed to attain that reduction.
ARB and local air pollution control districts are developing plans to meet new NAAQS for ozone and PM2.5. The
draft strategy for California’s 2007 SIP was released in April 2007, and the adopted version was transmitted to
EPA in November 2007 (ARB 2008b).
Toxic Air Contaminants
TACs in California are regulated primarily through the Tanner Air Toxics Act (Assembly Bill [AB] 1807,
Chapter 1047, Statutes of 1983) and the Air Toxics Hot Spots Information and Assessment Act of 1987
(AB 2588, Chapter 1252, Statutes of 1987). AB 1807 sets forth a formal procedure for ARB to designate
substances as TACs. This includes research, public participation, and scientific peer review before ARB can
designate a substance as a TAC. To date, ARB has identified more than 21 TACs and adopted EPA’s list of HAPs
as TACs. Most recently, diesel particulate matter (diesel PM) was added to ARB’s list of TACs.
Once a TAC is identified, ARB then adopts an airborne toxics control measure (ATCM) for sources that emit that
particular TAC. If there is a safe threshold for a substance at which no toxic effect will occur, the control measure
must reduce exposure below that threshold. If no safe threshold exists, the measure must incorporate BACT to
minimize emissions.
The Hot Spots Act requires facilities emitting toxic substances above a specified level to prepare an inventory of
toxic emissions, prepare a risk assessment if emissions are substantial, notify the public of significant risk levels,
and prepare and implement risk reduction measures.
ARB has adopted diesel-exhaust control measures and more stringent emissions standards for on-road mobile
sources of emissions (e.g., transit buses) and off-road diesel equipment (e.g., tractors, generators). In February
2000, ARB adopted a new public-transit bus fleet rule and emissions standards for new urban buses. These new
rules and standards included more stringent emissions standards for some new urban bus engines, beginning with
the 2002 model year; zero-emission-bus demonstration and purchase requirements for transit agencies; and
reporting requirements, under which transit agencies must demonstrate compliance with the public-transit bus
fleet rule. Recent milestones included the low-sulfur diesel fuel requirement and tighter emissions standards for
heavy-duty diesel trucks (effective in 2007 and subsequent model years) and off-road diesel equipment (2011)
nationwide. Over time, replacing older vehicles will result in a vehicle fleet that produces substantially lower
levels of TACs than under current conditions. Mobile-source emissions of TACs (e.g., benzene, 1-3-butadiene,
diesel PM) in California have been reduced significantly over the last decade; such emissions will be reduced
further through a progression of regulatory measures (e.g., Low Emission Vehicle/Clean Fuels and Phase II
reformulated-gasoline regulations) and control technologies. With implementation of ARB’s risk reduction plan,
it is expected that diesel PM concentrations will be reduced by 75 percent in 2010 and 85 percent in 2020 from
the estimated year-2000 level. Adopted regulations are also expected to continue to reduce emissions of
formaldehyde from cars and light-duty trucks. As emissions are reduced, it is expected that risks associated with
exposure to the emissions will also be reduced.
Tahoe Regional Planning Agency
Goals and Policies
The Goals and Policies of the 1987 Regional Plan (TRPA 2006) establish an overall framework for development
and environmental conservation in the Lake Tahoe region. These goals and policies are designed to achieve and
maintain adopted environmental threshold carrying capacities (thresholds) and are implemented through the
TRPA Code of Ordinances. Chapter II (Land Use Element) of the Goals and Policies document consists of seven
subelements, one of which is the Air Quality subelement (TRPA 2006). However, the Air Quality subelement
does not contain any specific goals or policies.

Air Quality

TRPA has jurisdiction within the LTAB portion of El Dorado County in regard to air quality. Therefore, the Air
Quality subelement focuses on achieving the NAAQS and CAAQS as well as special TRPA-adopted regional and
subregional visibility standards, and on reducing the deposition of nitrate from oxides of nitrogen (NOX) emitted
by vehicles. TRPA’s Code of Ordinances and Regional Transportation Plan contain specific measures designed to
monitor and achieve the air quality objectives of the Regional Plan. EDCAQMD’s rules and regulations
(discussed below) also govern in the Lake Tahoe area.
Code of Ordinances
TRPA adopted Section 65.1 (Air Quality Control) and Section 65.2 (Traffic and Air Quality Mitigation Program)
of the TRPA Code of Ordinances (TRPA 2011). The applicable provisions of these chapters are described below.
Section 65.1—Air Quality Control
The provisions of Section 65.1 apply to direct sources of air pollution in the Lake Tahoe region, including certain
motor vehicles registered in the region, combustion heaters installed in the region, open burning and stationary
sources of air pollution, and idling combustion engines:
►

►

Section 65.1.3, “Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program,” states that to avoid duplication of effort in
implementing an inspection/maintenance program for certain vehicles registered in the CO nonattainment
area, TRPA shall work with the affected state agencies to plan for applying state inspection/maintenance
programs to the Lake Tahoe region.
Section 65.1.4, “Combustion Appliances,” establishes emissions standards for wood heaters, as well as
natural gas– or propane-fired water heaters and central furnaces.
Section 65.1.6.A “Environmental Assessment,” states that any new stationary source of air pollution that
produces emissions for the peak 24-hour period beyond any of the limits in Table 65.1.6-1, reproduced as
Table 3.2-2 below, shall be considered to have a significant adverse environmental impact. New stationary
sources that have a significant adverse environmental impact shall be prohibited.

Section 65.2—Traffic and Air Quality Mitigation Program
The purpose of Section 65.2 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances is to establish fees and other procedures to offset
impacts from indirect sources of air pollution. As part of the project application for any additional development
that would result in an increase of more than 200 daily vehicle trips, a technically adequate analysis of potential
traffic and air quality impacts must be prepared (Section 65.2.4.B). To offset regional and cumulative impacts,

project proponents must contribute to the air quality mitigation fund, or they may provide mitigation measures
that cost at least as much as the required contribution to the air quality mitigation fund (Section 65.2.4.C). Such
regional and cumulative mitigation measures may include transportation systems management measures such as
bicycle facilities and pedestrian facilities.
Regional Transportation Plan—Air Quality (Goals and Policies, Action Element)
The purpose of the Regional Transportation Plan—Air Quality Plan (RTP-AQP) is to attain and maintain the
thresholds established by TRPA in 1982, and all applicable federal, state, and local standards established for
transportation and air quality. The RTP-AQP contains specific measures designed to monitor and achieve the air
quality objectives of its Regional Plan and to attain and maintain the TRPA thresholds (TRPA 1982).
TRPA thresholds address CO, ozone, regional and subregional visibility, and nitrate deposition. There are
numerical standards for each of these parameters, in addition to management standards that are intended to assist
in attaining the thresholds. The management standards include reducing wood smoke, maintaining NOX levels,
reducing traffic volumes on U.S. 50, and reducing vehicle miles of travel. These thresholds and associated
management standards are described in more detail in the following section. In addition, the Tahoe Regional
Planning Compact states that the Regional Plan shall provide for attaining and maintaining federal, state, or local
air quality standards, whichever are strictest, in the respective portions of the region for which the standards are
applicable.
El Dorado County Air Quality Management District
Overview
EDCAQMD attains and maintains air quality conditions in El Dorado County through a comprehensive program
of planning, regulation, enforcement, technical innovation, and promotion of the understanding of air quality
issues. The clean-air strategy of EDCAQMD includes preparing plans for the attainment of ambient air quality
standards, adopting and enforcing rules and regulations concerning sources of air pollution, and issuing permits
for stationary sources of air pollution. EDCAQMD also inspects stationary sources of air pollution and responds
to citizen complaints, monitors ambient air quality and meteorological conditions, and implements programs and
regulations required by the CAA, CAAA, and CCAA. Air quality plans applicable used to evaluate project
impacts are discussed below.
The 1994 Sacramento Regional Clean Air Plan was developed cooperatively with all the air quality management
districts (AQMD) and air pollution control districts (APCD) in the Sacramento Region (EDCAQMD, Feather
River AQMD, Placer County APCD, Sacramento Metropolitan AQMD, and Yolo-Solano AQMD). The plan was
adopted in 1994 in compliance with the Federal 1990 CAAA. At that time, the region could not show that it
would meet the federal 1-hour ozone standard by 1999. In exchange for moving the deadline to 2005, the region
accepted a designation of “severe nonattainment” for the federal 1-hour ozone standard, with additional emissions
requirements imposed on stationary sources. Updates to the plan were adopted in 1999 and 2002. However, on
June 15, 2005, the federal 1-hour ozone standard was revoked and subsequent air quality plans were focused
toward the federal 8-hour ozone standard. A new clean-air plan draft developed for the 8-hour ozone standard was
released in September 2008. However, in September 2011, EPA promulgated its revised and more stringent ozone
standard of 0.075 parts per million (ppm) that triggered new area designations released in July 2012. The
Sacramento Region (El Dorado, Placer, Sacramento, Solano, Sutter, and Yolo counties) was designated as a
Severe 15 nonattainment area for the new 8-hour ozone standard (EPA 2012). The region has three years after the
final EPA designation (i.e., July 2012) to prepare a new attainment plan. At the time of this writing, the new
federal 8-hour ozone plan is being developed for the more stringent federal 8-hour ozone standard.
All projects are subject to adopted EDCAQMD rules and regulations in effect at the time of this analysis
applicable to the project include the following:

►

Rule 202—Visible Emissions. A person shall not discharge into the atmosphere from any single source of
emission whatsoever any air contaminant for a period or periods aggregating more than three minutes in any
one hour which is as dark or darker in shade as that designated as number 1 on the Ringelmann Chart, as
published by the U.S. Bureau of Mines.

Rule 223-1—Fugitive Dust—Construction.
A. PURPOSE: The purpose of this rule is to reduce the amount of particulate matter entrained in the ambient air
as a result of anthropogenic (manmade) fugitive dust sources by requiring actions to prevent, reduce, or
mitigate fugitive dust emissions.
B. APPLICABILITY: The provisions of this rule are applicable to specified outdoor fugitive dust sources. The
definitions, exemptions, requirements, administrative requirements, recordkeeping requirements, and test
methods set forth in this rule are applicable to Rules 223, 223-1 and 223-2 of the Rules and Regulations of the
El Dorado County Air Quality Management District.
As discussed above, TRPA has jurisdiction over air quality considerations in the LTAB portion of El Dorado
County, although EDCAQMD’s rules and regulations are also applicable within TRPA’s jurisdiction
(EDCAQMD 2002).
Toxic Air Contaminants
At the local level, APCDs or AQMDs may adopt and enforce ARB control measures. Under EDCAQMD
Regulation V, all sources with the potential to emit TACs are required to obtain permits from the district. Permits
may be granted to these operations if they are constructed and operated in accordance with applicable regulations,
including new-source review standards and ATCMs. EDCAQMD limits emissions and public exposure to TACs
through several programs. EDCAQMD prioritizes TAC-emitting stationary sources based on the quantity and
toxicity of the TAC emissions and the proximity of the facilities to sensitive receptors.
Sources that require a permit are analyzed by EDCAQMD (e.g., through a health risk assessment) based on their
potential to emit toxics. If it is determined that the source would emit TACs in excess of EDCAQMD’s threshold
of significance for TACs, as identified below, sources must implement the best available control technology for
TACs (T-BACT) to reduce emissions. If a source cannot reduce the risk below the threshold of significance even
after T-BACT has been implemented, EDCAQMD will deny the permit. This helps to prevent new problems and
reduces emissions from existing older sources by requiring them to apply new technology when retrofitting with
respect to TACs. It is important to note that EDAQMD’s air quality permitting process applies to stationary
sources; properties that are exposed to elevated levels of TACs from nonstationary type sources and the
nonstationary type sources themselves (e.g., on-road vehicles) are not subject to air quality permits. Further, for
reasons of feasibility and practicality, mobile sources (e.g., cars and trucks) are not required to implement
T-BACT, even if they have the potential to expose adjacent properties to elevated levels of TACs. Rather,
emissions controls on such sources (e.g., vehicles) are subject to regulations implemented on the federal and state
levels.
Odors
EDCAQMD has determined some common types of facilities that have been known to produce odors: wastewater
treatment facilities, chemical manufacturing plants, painting/coating operations, feed lots/dairies, composting
facilities, landfills, and transfer stations. Because offensive odors rarely cause any physical harm, and federal and
state air quality regulations do not contain any requirements for their control, EDCAQMD has no rules or
standards related to odor emissions other than its nuisance rule:
►

Rule 205—Nuisance. A person shall not discharge from any source whatsoever such quantities of air
contaminants or other material which cause injury, detriment, nuisance or annoyance to any considerable

number of persons, or to the public, or which endanger the comfort, repose, health or safety of any such
persons, or the public, or which cause to have a natural tendency to cause injury or damage to business or
property. The provisions of Rule 205 do not apply to odors emanating from agriculture operations necessary
for the growing of crops or raising of fowl or animals.
Any actions related to odors are based on citizen complaints to local governments and EDCAQMD.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The study area is located in the southern portion of the LTAB. The LTAB comprises portions of El Dorado and
Placer Counties on the California side, and Washoe County, Douglas County, and the Carson City Rural District
on the Nevada side.
The ambient concentrations of air pollutant emissions are determined by the amount of pollutants emitted and the
atmosphere’s ability to transport and dilute such emissions. Natural factors that affect transport and dilution
include terrain, wind, atmospheric stability, and the presence of sunlight. Therefore, existing air quality conditions
in the area are determined by such natural factors as climate, meteorology, and topography, in addition to the level
of emissions by existing air pollutant sources. These factors are discussed separately below.
Climate, Meteorology, and Topography
Lake Tahoe lies in a depression between the crests of the Sierra Nevada and Carson ranges on the CaliforniaNevada border at a surface elevation of approximately 6,260 feet above sea level. The LTAB is defined by the
7,000-foot contour, which is continuous around the lake, except near Tahoe City. The mountains surrounding the
lake are approximately 8,000–9,000 feet in height on average, with some reaching 10,000 feet.
The water temperature of Lake Tahoe remains constant at 600 feet below the surface. This constant temperature is
approximately 39 degrees Fahrenheit (ºF). This characteristic, in combination with the topographic location of the
lake, defines one of the LTAB’s most important atmospheric regimes: In the absence of strong synoptic weather
systems (large scale system, 620 miles or more), the LTAB develops shallow subsidence and radiation inversions
throughout the year (air temperature variations unique to the basin relative to surrounding areas). In addition,
rapid radiation cooling at night regularly generates gentle nocturnal, down slope winds that blow from the
mountain ridges down to the shore, then fan across the lake (Cahill and Cliff 2000).
Pollutants from local sources are trapped by frequent atmospheric inversions in the LTAB, greatly limiting the
volume of air into which the pollutants are mixed (e.g., diluted), which results in accumulation and elevated
concentrations. Further, each night the down slope winds transport local pollutants from nearby developed areas
out over the lake, increasing the opportunity for pollutants to deposit. This meteorological regime, characterized
by weak or calm winds and a strong inversion, is the most common pattern at all times of the year (Cahill and
Cliff 2000).
A second important meteorological regime is the transport of pollutants from the Sacramento Valley and San
Francisco Bay Area, because winds from these areas move upslope in the Sierra Nevada, and the lake is located
directly east of the Sierra Nevada crest. This pattern develops when the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada are
heated, causing the air to rise in a chimney effect and move upslope to the Sierra crest and over into the LTAB.
The strength of this pattern depends on the amount of heating, and thus is strongest in summer, beginning in April
and essentially ceasing in late October (Cahill and Cliff 2000).
Other regimes in the LTAB are defined by strong synoptic weather patterns that overcome the dominant terraindefined meteorology regimes discussed above. The most important is the winter storm regime, which is
responsible for precipitation in the form of snow or rain (Cahill and Cliff 2000).

Air Quality

Each of the meteorological regimes has the potential to influence pollution concentrations in the LTAB.
Concentrations of pollutants typically increase when local inversions are present, trapping emissions, and when
conditions allow pollution to be transported from the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada, the Sacramento Valley,
and San Francisco Bay. Recent studies have even shown spring and fall contributions to local pollution levels
from Asia. Periods of lesser concentrations of pollutants are associated with winter storms and high winds. Winter
storms dilute the local and upwind pollution with strong vertical mixing and the incorporation of clean North
Pacific air (Cahill and Cliff 2000).
Local meteorological conditions representative of the study area are recorded at the South Lake Tahoe Airport
Station. The annual normal precipitation is approximately 15 inches, and occurs primarily from November
through March. January temperatures average approximately 26ºF and August temperatures average
approximately 63ºF (WRCC 2008a). The annual predominant wind direction and mean speed is from the south at
6 miles per hour (mph) (WRCC 2008b).
Criteria Air Pollutants
Concentrations of ozone, CO, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, and lead are used as indicators of ambient air quality
conditions. These are the most prevalent air pollutants known to be deleterious to human health and for which
acceptable concentrations have been determined; thus, they are commonly referred to as “criteria air pollutants.”
A brief description of each criteria air pollutant—source types, health effects, and future trends—follows. A
description of the most current emissions inventory, attainment area designations, and monitoring data for the
study area is provided below.
Ozone
Ozone is a photochemical oxidant, a substance whose oxygen combines chemically with another substance in the
presence of sunlight, and the primary component of smog. Ozone is not directly emitted into the air, but is formed
through complex chemical reactions between precursor emissions of reactive organic gases (ROG) and NOX in
the presence of sunlight. ROG are volatile organic compounds that are photochemically reactive. ROG emissions
result primarily from incomplete combustion and the evaporation of chemical solvents and fuels. NOX are a group
of gaseous compounds of nitrogen and oxygen that results from the combustion of fuels. A highly reactive
molecule, ozone readily combines with many different components of the atmosphere. Consequently, high levels
of ozone tend to exist only while high ROG and NOX levels are present to sustain the ozone formation process.
Once the precursors have been depleted, ozone levels rapidly decline. Because these reactions occur on a regional
scale, ozone is a regional pollutant.
Ozone located in the upper atmosphere (stratosphere) acts in a beneficial manner by shielding the earth from
harmful ultraviolet radiation that is emitted by the sun. However, ozone located in the lower atmosphere
(troposphere) is a major health and environmental concern. Meteorology and terrain play a major role in ozone
formation. Generally, low wind speeds or stagnant air coupled with warm temperatures and clear skies provide
the optimum conditions for formation. As a result, summer is generally the peak ozone season. Because of the
reaction time of ozone formation, peak ozone concentrations often occur far downwind of the precursor
emissions. In general, ozone concentrations over or near urban and rural areas result from an interplay of
emissions of ozone precursors, transport, meteorology, and atmospheric chemistry (Godish 2004:169, 170).
The adverse health effects associated with exposure to ozone pertain primarily to the respiratory system. Scientific
evidence indicates that ambient levels of ozone affect not only sensitive receptors, such as asthmatics and
children, but healthy adults as well. Exposure to ambient levels of ozone ranging from 0.10 ppm to 0.40 ppm for
one to two hours has been found to significantly alter lung functions by increasing respiratory rates and
pulmonary resistance, decreasing tidal volumes (the amount of air inhaled and exhaled), and impairing respiratory
mechanics. Ambient levels of ozone above 0.12 ppm are linked to such symptoms as throat dryness, chest
tightness, headache, and nausea. In addition to the above adverse health effects, evidence exists relating ozone

Air Quality

exposure to an increase in permeability of respiratory epithelia; such increased permeability leads to an increased
response of the respiratory system to challenges, and a decrease in the immune system’s ability to defend against
infection (Godish 2004:169, 170).
Ozone emissions have decreased over the past several years because of more stringent motor vehicle standards
and cleaner burning fuels. Peak levels have not declined as much as the number of days that standards are
exceeded has declined. From 1990 to 2006, the maximum peak eight-hour indicator decreased by six percent. The
number of state eight-hour exceedance days declined by 75 percent. Most of this progress occurred after 1999.
However, there were no exceedance days in 2003, 2004, and 2005 and two in 2006; these were among the lowest
rates in the 17-year period (ARB 2008c). Data from 2006 showing the trend in three-year averages of eight-hour
ozone data indicate that the LTAB continues to be in attainment for the national and state ozone standards (ARB
2008c).
Carbon Monoxide
CO is a colorless, odorless, and poisonous gas produced by incomplete burning of carbon in fuels, primarily from
mobile (transportation) sources. In fact, 77 percent of the nationwide CO emissions are from mobile sources. The
other 23 percent consists of CO emissions from wood-burning stoves, incinerators, and industrial sources.
CO enters the bloodstream through the lungs by combining with hemoglobin, which normally supplies oxygen to
the cells. However, CO combines with hemoglobin much more readily than oxygen does, resulting in a drastic
reduction in the amount of oxygen available to the cells. Adverse health effects associated with exposure to CO
concentrations include such symptoms as dizziness, headaches, and fatigue. CO exposure is especially harmful to
individuals who suffer from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases (EPA 2008a).
The highest concentrations are generally associated with cold, stagnant weather conditions that occur during the
winter. In contrast to problems caused by ozone, which tends to be a regional pollutant, CO problems tend to be
localized. CO levels are in attainment for Federal and State designations. CO is in nonattainment for TRPA
designations.
Nitrogen Dioxide
NO2 is a brownish, highly reactive gas that is present in all urban environments. The major human-made sources
of NO2 are combustion devices, such as boilers, gas turbines, and mobile and stationary reciprocating internalcombustion engines. Combustion devices emit primarily nitric oxide (NO), which reacts through oxidation in the
atmosphere to form NO2 (EPA 2008b). The combined emissions of NO and NO2 are referred to as NOX and
reported as equivalent NO2. Because NO2 is formed and depleted by reactions associated with ozone, the NO2
concentration in a particular geographical area may not be representative of the local NOX emission sources.
Inhalation is the most common route of exposure to NO2. Because NO2 has relatively low solubility in water, the
principal site of toxicity is in the lower respiratory tract. The severity of the adverse health effects depends
primarily on the concentration inhaled rather than the duration of exposure. An individual may experience a
variety of acute symptoms during or shortly after exposure, including coughing, difficulty with breathing,
vomiting, headache, and eye irritation. After approximately four to twelve hours, an exposed individual may
experience chemical pneumonitis or pulmonary edema with breathing abnormalities, cough, cyanosis, chest pain,
and rapid heartbeat. Severe, symptomatic NO2 intoxication after acute exposure has occasionally been linked with
prolonged respiratory impairment, with such symptoms as chronic bronchitis and decreased lung functions (EPA
2008b). NO2 levels are in attainment for federal and state designations. TRPA does not have an NO2 designation.
Sulfur Dioxide
SO2 is produced by such stationary sources as coal and oil combustion, steel mills, refineries, and pulp and paper
mills. The major adverse health effects associated with SO2 exposure pertain to the upper respiratory tract. SO2 is

3.2-11

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Air Quality

a respiratory irritant; constriction of the bronchioles occurs with inhalation of SO2 at 5 ppm or more. On contact
with the moist, mucous membranes, SO2 produces sulfurous acid, which is a direct irritant. Concentration rather
than duration of the exposure is an important determinant of respiratory effects. Exposure to high SO2
concentrations may result in edema of the lungs or glottis and respiratory paralysis (EPA 2008d). SO2 levels are in
attainment for federal and state designations. TRPA does not have a SO2 designation.
Particulate Matter
Respirable particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 micrometers or less is referred to as PM10. PM10
consists of particulate matter emitted directly into the air, such as fugitive dust, soot, and smoke from mobile and
stationary sources, construction operations, fires and natural windblown dust, and particulate matter formed in the
atmosphere by condensation and/or transformation of SO2 and ROG (EPA 2008c). Fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
is a subgroup of PM10, consisting of smaller particles that have an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 micrometers or
less (ARB 2008c:1-20).
The adverse health effects associated with PM10 depend on the specific composition of the particulate matter. For
example, health effects may be associated with metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and other toxic
substances adsorbed onto fine particulate matter (referred to as the “piggybacking effect”), or with fine dust
particles of silica or asbestos. Generally, adverse health effects associated with PM10 may result from both shortterm and long-term exposure to elevated concentrations and may include breathing and respiratory symptoms,
aggravation of existing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, alterations to the immune system, carcinogenesis,
and premature death (EPA 2008c). PM2.5 poses an increased health risk because the particles can deposit deep in
the lungs and may contain substances that are particularly harmful to human health.
Direct emissions of PM10 remained relatively unchanged between 1975 and 2005 and are projected to remain
unchanged through 2020. PM10 emissions in the LTAB are dominated by emissions from areawide sources,
primarily fugitive dust from vehicle travel on unpaved and paved roads, waste burning, and residential fuel
combustion. The state annual average concentrations remained relatively constant from 1999 through 2005, with a
slight drop in 2006. The differences in trends are the result of differences in national and State and monitoring
methods. PM2.5 emissions in the LTAB are dominated by emissions from the same areawide sources as PM10
(ARB 2008c:1-20).
Lead
Lead is a metal found naturally in the environment as well as in manufactured products. The major sources of lead
emissions have historically been mobile and industrial sources. As a result of the phase-out of leaded gasoline, as
discussed in detail below, metal processing is currently the primary source of lead emissions. The highest levels
of lead in air are generally found near lead smelters. Other stationary sources are waste incinerators, utilities, and
lead-acid battery manufacturers.
Thirty years ago, mobile sources were the main contributor to ambient lead concentrations in the air. In the early
1970s, EPA set national regulations to gradually reduce the lead content in gasoline. In 1975, unleaded gasoline
was introduced for motor vehicles equipped with catalytic converters. EPA banned the use of leaded gasoline in
highway vehicles in December 1995 (EPA 2008e).
As a result of EPA’s regulatory efforts to remove lead from gasoline, emissions of lead from the transportation
sector have declined dramatically (95 percent between 1980 and 1999), and levels of lead in the air decreased by
94 percent between 1980 and 1999. Transportation sources, primarily airplanes, now contribute only 13 percent of
lead emissions. A national health and nutrition examination survey reported a 78 percent decrease in the levels of
lead in people’s blood between 1976 and 1991. This dramatic decline can be attributed to the move from leaded to
unleaded gasoline (EPA 2008e).

The decrease in lead emissions and ambient lead concentrations over the past 25 years is California’s most
dramatic success story with regard to air quality management. The rapid decrease in lead concentrations can be
attributed primarily to phasing out the lead in gasoline. This phase-out began during the 1970s, and subsequent
ARB regulations have virtually eliminated all lead from gasoline now sold in California. All areas of the state are
currently designated as attainment for the state lead standard (EPA does not designate areas for the national lead
standard). Although the ambient lead standards are no longer violated, lead emissions from stationary sources still
pose “hot spot” problems in some areas. As a result, ARB identified lead as a TAC. Lead levels are in attainment
for federal and state designations. TRPA does not have a lead designation.
Monitoring Station Data and Attainment Area Designations
Concentrations of criteria air pollutants are measured at several monitoring stations in the LTAB. The South Lake
Tahoe–Sandy Way and South Lake Tahoe–1901 Airport Road stations are the closest monitoring stations to the
study area with recent data for ozone, CO, NO2, PM10, and PM2.5. In general, the ambient air quality
measurements from these monitoring stations are representative of the air quality in the vicinity of the study area.
Table 3.2-3 summarizes the air quality data from these stations for the 3 most recent years for which data are
available (2006–2008).

EPA, ARB, and TRPA use this type of monitoring data to designate areas according to attainment status for
criteria air pollutants established by the agencies. The purpose of these designations is to identify those areas with
air quality problems and thereby initiate planning efforts for improvement. The three basic designation categories
are nonattainment, attainment, and unclassified. Unclassified is used in areas that cannot be classified on the basis
of available information as meeting or not meeting the standards. The most current national, state, and TRPA
attainment designations for the El Dorado County portion of the LTAB are shown in Table 3.2-4 for each criteria

Emissions Inventory for Criteria Air Pollutants
Table 3.2-5 summarizes emissions of criteria air pollutants within the LTAB portion of El Dorado County for
various source categories. According to El Dorado County’s LTAB emissions inventory, mobile sources are the
largest contributor to the estimated annual average air pollutant levels of ROG, CO, NOX, and oxides of sulfur
(SOX), accounting for approximately 63, 68, 90, and 100 percent, respectively, of the total emissions. Areawide
sources account for approximately 92 and 90 percent of the County’s PM10 and PM2.5 emissions, respectively.
Toxic Air Contaminants
Concentrations of TACs are also used as indicators of ambient air quality conditions. A TAC is defined as an air
pollutant that may cause or contribute to an increase in mortality or in serious illness, or that may pose a hazard to
human health. TACs are usually present in minute quantities in the ambient air; however, their high toxicity or
health risk may pose a threat to public health even at low concentrations.

Diesel Particulate Matter
According to the California Almanac of Emissions and Air Quality (ARB 2008c), most of the estimated health
risk from TACs can be attributed to relatively few compounds, the most important being PM from diesel-fueled
engines (diesel PM). Diesel PM differs from other TACs in that it is not a single substance, but rather a complex
mixture of hundreds of substances. Although diesel PM is emitted by diesel-fueled internal-combustion engines,
the composition of the emissions varies depending on engine type, operating conditions, fuel composition,
lubricating oil, and whether an emission control system is present. Unlike the other TACs, no ambient monitoring
data are available for diesel PM because no routine measurement method currently exists. However, ARB has
made preliminary concentration estimates based on a PM exposure method. This method uses the ARB emissions
inventory’s PM10 database, ambient PM10 monitoring data, and the results from several studies to estimate
concentrations of diesel PM. In addition to diesel PM, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, acetaldehyde, carbon tetrachloride,
hexavalent chromium, para-dichlorobenzene, formaldehyde, methylene chloride, and perchloroethylene pose the
greatest existing ambient risk in California of the TACs for which data are available.
Diesel PM poses the greatest health risk among these ten TACs mentioned. Based on receptor modeling
techniques, ARB estimated California’s statewide average diesel PM health risk in 2000 to be 540 excess cancer
cases per million people. Since 1990, the state’s health risk from diesel PM has been reduced by 40 percent.
Overall, levels of most TACs, except for para-dichlorobenzene and formaldehyde, have gone down since 1990
(ARB 2008c).

Existing sources of TACs in the project vicinity include mobile-source emissions from surrounding highways
(e.g., U.S. 50) and from minor stationary sources such as the South Lake Tahoe Airport. There are no major
existing stationary sources of TACs near the study area (ARB 2008f, 2008g).
Naturally Occurring Asbestos
Asbestos is the common name for a group of naturally occurring fibrous silicate minerals that can separate into
thin but strong and durable fibers. Naturally occurring asbestos, which was identified as a TAC by ARB in 1986,
is located in many parts of California and is commonly associated with serpentine.
According to a report by the California Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology, A General
Location Guide to Ultramafic Rocks in California—Areas More Likely to Contain Naturally Occurring Asbestos
(Churchill and Hill 2000:2), the study area is not located in an area that is likely to contain naturally occurring
asbestos.
Odors
Odors are typically regarded as an annoyance rather than a health hazard. However, a person’s reaction to foul
odors can range from psychological (e.g., irritation, anger, or anxiety) to physiological (e.g., circulatory and
respiratory effects, nausea, vomiting, and headache).
With respect to odors, the human nose is the sole sensing device. The ability to detect odors varies considerably
among the population and is quite subjective. Some individuals can smell very minute quantities of specific
substances; others may not have the same sensitivity, but may have sensitivities to odors of other substances. In
addition, people may have different reactions to the same odor; in fact, an odor that is offensive to one person
may be perfectly acceptable to another (e.g., some odors at fast-food restaurants). It is important to also note that
an unfamiliar odor is more easily detected and is more likely to cause complaints than a familiar one. This is
because of the phenomenon known as odor fatigue, in which a person can become desensitized to almost any odor
and recognition only occurs with an alteration in the intensity.
Quality and intensity are two properties present in any odor. The quality of an odor indicates the nature of the
smell experience. For instance, if a person describes an odor as flowery or sweet, then the person is describing the
quality of the odor. Intensity refers to the strength of the odor. For example, a person may use the word “strong”
to describe the intensity of an odor. Odor intensity depends on the odorant concentration in the air. When an
odorous sample is progressively diluted, the odorant concentration decreases. As this occurs, the odor intensity
weakens and eventually becomes so low that the odor is quite difficult to detect or recognize. At some point
during dilution, the concentration of the odorant reaches a detection threshold. An odorant concentration below
the detection threshold means that the concentration in the air is not detectable by the average human.
Notable odor sources in the vicinity (i.e., within two miles) of the study area are the South Tahoe Refuse
Recycling Center and the refuse center’s transfer station, both located approximately one mile south of the study
area, on Ruth Avenue. There are no other major odor sources (e.g., wastewater treatment facilities, landfills, or
food processing facilities) in the vicinity of the study area.

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

REGULATORY BACKGROUND
Federal
Supreme Court Ruling on California Clean Air Act Waiver
EPA is the federal agency responsible for implementing the CAA. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on April 2,
2007, that CO2 is an air pollutant as defined under the CAA and that EPA has the authority to regulate emissions
of GHGs. However, there are no federal regulations or policies regarding GHG emissions applicable to the project
or alternatives under consideration. See AB 1493 (discussed in the “State” section below under “Summary of
Laws and Executive Orders”) for further information on the CCAA Waiver.
Energy and Independence Security Act of 2007 and Corporate Average Fuel Economy
Standards
The Energy and Independence Security Act of 2007 (EISA) amended the Energy Policy and Conservation Act
(EPCA) to further reduce fuel consumption and expand production of renewable fuels. The EISA’s most
important amendment includes a statutory mandate for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA) to set corporate-average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for each model year (MY) of passenger cars
at the maximum feasible level. This statutory mandate also eliminates the old default CAFE standard of 27.5
miles per gallon. The EISA requires that CAFE standards for MYs 2011–2020 be set sufficiently high to achieve
the goal of an industrywide average CAFE standard of 35 miles per gallon for passenger cars and light-duty
trucks.
In accordance with President Obama’s request, the rulemaking for this goal has been divided into two parts. The
first part, which was published in the Federal Register in March 2009, included CAFE standards for MY 2011 to
meet the statutory deadline (March 30, 2009). The second part of the rulemaking, which applies to MY 2012 and
subsequent years, consists of the maximum CAFE standards feasible under the limits of the EPCA and EISA.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Regulations
In response to the mounting issue of climate change, EPA has taken the following actions to regulate, monitor,
and potentially reduce GHG emissions.
Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule
On September 22, 2009, EPA issued a final rule for mandatory reporting of GHGs from large GHG emissions
sources in the United States. In general, this national reporting requirement will provide EPA with accurate and
timely GHG emissions data from facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons (MT) or more of CO2 per year. These
publicly available data will allow the reporters to track their own emissions, compare them to similar facilities,
and aid in identifying cost-effective opportunities to reduce emissions in the future. Reporting is at the facility
level, except that certain suppliers of fossil fuels and industrial GHG emitters, along with vehicle and engine
manufacturers, will report at the corporate level. An estimated 85% of the total U.S. GHG emissions, from
approximately 10,000 facilities, are covered by this final rule.
National Program to Cut Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Improve Fuel Economy for Cars and Trucks
On September 15, 2009, EPA and the U.S. Department of Transportation’s NHTSA proposed a new national
program that would reduce GHG emissions and improve fuel economy for all new cars and trucks sold in the
United States. EPA proposed the first-ever national GHG emissions standards under the CAA, and NHTSA

Air Quality

proposed CAFE standards under the EPCA. This proposed national program would allow automobile
manufacturers to build a single light-duty national fleet that would satisfy all requirements under both federal
programs and the standards of California and other states.
Proposed Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases
On December 7, 2009, EPA adopted its Proposed Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for
Greenhouse Gases under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act (Endangerment Finding). The Endangerment
Finding is based on Section 202(a) of the CAA, which states that the EPA Administrator should regulate and
develop standards for “emission[s] of air pollution from any class of classes of new motor vehicles or new motor
vehicle engines, which in [its] judgment cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated
to endanger public health or welfare.”
The rule addresses Section 202(a) in two distinct findings. The first addresses whether atmospheric concentrations
of the six key GHGs (CO2, methane [CH4], nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur
hexafluoride) threaten the health and welfare of current and future generations. The second finding addresses
whether the combined emissions of GHGs from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute to
atmospheric concentrations of GHGs, and thus to the threat of climate change.
The EPA Administrator found that atmospheric concentrations of GHGs endanger public health and welfare
within the meaning of CAA Section 202(a). The EPA Administrator also found that GHG emissions from new
motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines are contributing to air pollution, which is endangering public health and
welfare.
Council on Environmental Quality Draft NEPA Guidelines
Because of uneven treatment of climate change under NEPA, the International Center for Technology
Assessment, Natural Resources Defense Council, and Sierra Club filed a petition with the Council on
Environmental Quality (CEQ) in March 2008, requesting that climate change analyses be included in all federal
environmental review documents. In response to the petition and Executive Order 13514, CEQ issued new draft
guidance on when and how to include GHG emissions and climate change impacts in environmental review
documents under NEPA. CEQ’s guidance (issued on February 18, 2010) suggests that federal agencies should
consider opportunities to reduce GHG emissions caused by their proposed actions, adapt the actions to climate
change impacts throughout the NEPA process, and address these issues in their agency NEPA procedures.
In the context of addressing climate change in environmental documentation, the two main considerations are:
►

►

the GHG emissions effects of a proposed action and alternative actions, and
the impacts of climate change on a proposed action or alternatives. CEQ notes that “significant” national
policy decisions with “substantial” GHG impacts require analysis of their GHG effects—that is, if a proposed
action would cause “substantial” annual direct emissions, or if a Federal agency action implicates energy
conservation, reduced energy use, or GHG emissions and/or promotes renewable-energy technologies that are
cleaner and more efficient.

In these circumstances, information on GHG emissions (qualitative or quantitative) that is useful and relevant to
the decision should be used when deciding among alternatives. CEQ suggests that if a proposed action would
cause direct annual emissions of ≥25,000 MT carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), a quantitative and qualitative
assessment may be meaningful to decision makers and the public. If annual direct emissions would be less than
25,000 MT CO2e, CEQ encourages federal agencies to consider whether the action’s long-term emissions should
receive similar analyses.

State
Because every nation emits GHGs and thus makes an incremental cumulative contribution to global climate
change, cooperation on a global scale will be required to reduce the rate of GHG emissions to a level that can help
to slow or stop the human-caused increase in average global temperatures and associated changes in climatic
conditions. Several statewide initiatives relevant to land use planning are discussed below; however, this does not
represent a complete list of climate change–related legislation in California.
Summary of Laws and Executive Orders
Various statewide initiatives to reduce the State’s contribution to GHG emissions have raised awareness that,
even though the various contributors to and consequences of global climate change are not yet fully understood,
global climate change is under way, and real potential exists for severe adverse environmental, social, and
economic effects in the long term. Such initiatives include the following:
►

Assembly Bill 1493—In 2002, then-Governor Gray Davis signed AB 1493 (Stats. 2002, Ch. 200) (amending
Health and Safety Code, Section 42823 and adding Health and Safety Code, Section 43018.5). AB 1493
required that ARB develop and adopt, by January 1, 2005, regulations that achieve “the maximum feasible
reduction of GHGs emitted by passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks and other vehicles determined by
ARB to be vehicles whose primary use is noncommercial personal transportation in the state.”

►

Executive Order S-3-05—Executive Order S-3-05, which was signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger
in 2005, proclaims that California is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. It declares that increased
temperatures could reduce the Sierra’s snowpack, further exacerbate California’s air quality problems, and
potentially cause a rise in sea levels. To combat those concerns, the Executive Order established total GHG
emission targets. Specifically, emissions are to be reduced to the 2000 level by 2010, the 1990 level by 2020,
and to 80 percent below the 1990 level by 2050.

►

Assembly Bill 32, California Climate Solutions Act of 2006—In September 2006, Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger signed AB 32, the California Climate Solutions Act of 2006 (Stats. 2006, Ch. 488, enacting
Health and Safety Code, Sections 38500–38599.) AB 32 establishes regulatory, reporting, and market
mechanisms to achieve quantifiable reductions in GHG emissions and a cap on statewide GHG emissions. It
requires California to reduce its GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, and reduce gas emissions to 80
percent below 1990 levels by 2050.

►

California Senate Bill 97—Senate Bill (SB) 97, signed August 2007 by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger,
acknowledges that climate change is a prominent environmental issue that requires analysis under CEQA
(Stats. 2007, Ch. 185 (enacting Pub. Resources Code, Sections 21083.05 and 21097.) This bill directs the
Governor’s Office of Planning and Research (OPR) to prepare, develop, and transmit to the Natural
Resources Agency guidelines for feasible mitigation of GHG emissions or the effects of GHG emissions, as
required by CEQA, by July 1, 2009. The Natural Resources Agency was required to certify and adopt those
guidelines by January 1, 2010. The California Natural Resources Agency adopted those guidelines on
December 30, 2009, and the guidelines became effective March 18, 2010. The significance criteria developed
as part of SB 97 are used in this analysis to evaluate GHG emissions.

►

Executive Order S-13-08—EO S-13-08, issued November 14, 2008, directs the California Natural Resources
Agency, California Department of Water Resources, OPR, California Energy Commission, State Water
Resources Control Board, California Department of Parks and Recreation, and California’s coastal
management agencies to participate in a number of planning and research activities to advance California’s
ability to adapt to the impacts of climate change. The order specifically directs agencies to work with the
National Academy of Sciences to initiate the first California Sea Level Rise Assessment and to review and
update the assessment every two years after completion; directs the Resource Agency to immediately assess

the vulnerability of the California transportation system to sea level rise; and directs CAT to develop a
California Climate Change Adaptation Strategy.
Climate Change Scoping Plan
On December 11, 2008, pursuant to AB 32, CARB adopted the Climate Change Scoping Plan (CCSP). This plan
outlines how emissions reductions will be achieved from significant sources of GHGs via regulations, market
mechanisms, and other actions. Six key elements, outlined in the scoping plan, are identified to achieve emissions
reduction targets:
►

expanding and strengthening existing energy efficiency programs as well as building and appliance standards;

►

achieving a statewide renewable energy mix of 33 percent;

►

developing a California cap-and-trade program that links with other Western Climate Initiative partner
programs to create a regional market system;

►

establishing targets for transportation-related GHG emissions for regions throughout California, and pursuing
policies and incentives to achieve those targets;

►

►

adopting and implementing measures pursuant to existing state laws and policies, including California’s clean
car standards, goods movement measures, and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard; and
creating targeted fees, including a public goods charge on water use, fees on high global warming potential
gases, and a fee to fund the administrative costs of the state’s long-term commitment to AB 32
implementation.

The CCSP also included recommended 39 measures that were developed to reduce GHG emissions from key
sources and activities while improving public health, promoting a cleaner environment, preserving our natural
resources, and ensuring that the impacts of the reductions are equitable and do not disproportionately impact lowincome and minority communities. These measures also put the state on a path to meet the long-term 2050 goal of
reducing California’s GHG emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels. The measures in the approved CCSP will
be in place by 2012.
Governor’s Office of Planning and Research Technical Advisory
In June 2008, OPR released a Technical Advisory providing preliminary guidance to local agencies about how to
evaluate and mitigate effects of GHG emissions by projects, as required by CEQA. OPR requested that the ARB
recommend the method for setting significance thresholds for GHG emissions; thus, in October ARB released a
preliminary draft proposal (Guidance). Although in draft form, the Guidance does provide some assistance in
evaluating whether projects would impede the State’s mandatory requirements under AB 32 to reduce statewide
GHG emissions.
It describes three classes of common projects: industrial, commercial, and residential.
The Guidance recommends that one performance based threshold and one numerical threshold be obtained for
each project.
The Guidance states that some small residential and commercial projects, emitting 1,600 MT of CO2e would not
impede the State from achieving emission reduction objectives, and could be deemed categorically exempt from
CEQA. However, the Guidance has an unspecified numerical threshold for commercial and residential projects.
Projects emitting more than 1,600 MT of CO2e per year could or could not meet minimum performance standards.
The minimum performance standards would include complying with stringent standards for green building rating
AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX

systems and codes, energy efficiency, water conservation, outdoor potable water use, construction, waste
recycling, and residential transportation.
For industrial projects, the guidance states that projects emitting a significance threshold less than 7,000 MT CO2e
per year for operational emissions (excludes transportation) may be considered as having a less-than-significant
impact. This threshold is estimated to cover approximately 90% of GHG emissions from new industrial projects
statewide.
OPR CEQA Guidelines for GHG Emissions
The significance thresholds are not established in OPR’s Preliminary Draft CEQA Guideline Amendments for
GHG Emissions. To determine the significance impacts from project emissions, OPR indicates that lead agencies
should make a good-faith effort, based on available information, to calculate or estimate the GHG emissions
associated with a project. Lead agencies determine which, if any, model or methodology to quantify greenhouse
gas emissions should be selected, and whether qualitative analysis or performance based standards should be
relied upon.
California Climate Change Adaptation Strategy
In cooperation and partnership with multiple state agencies, the 2009 California Climate Adaptation Strategy
summarizes the best known science on climate change impacts in seven specific sectors (public health,
biodiversity and habitat, ocean and coastal resources, water management, agriculture; forestry, and transportation
and energy infrastructure) and provides recommendations on how to manage against those threats.
Addressing Climate Change at the Project Level: California Attorney General’s Office
In January 2010, the California Attorney General’s Office released a document to assist local agencies with
addressing climate change and sustainability at the individual project level under CEQA. The document provides
examples of various measures that may reduce project-level impacts related to climate change. As appropriate, the
measures can be included as design features of a project, required as changes to the project, or imposed as
mitigation (whether undertaken directly by the project proponent or funded by mitigation fees).

CLIMATE CHANGE ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Existing climate conditions and GHG emissions sources in California and the LTAB comprise the environmental
setting of climate change.
Global Climate Trends and Associated Impacts
The rate of increase in global average surface temperature over the last hundred years has not been consistent; the
last three decades have warmed at a much faster rate—on average 0.32°F per decade. Eleven of the 12 years from
1995 to 2006 rank among the 12 warmest years in the instrumental record of global average surface temperature
(going back to 1850) (IPCC 2007:4).
During the same period over which this increased global temperature has occurred, many other changes have
occurred in other natural systems. Among numerous other observed conditions, sea levels have risen on
average1.8 mm/yr; precipitation patterns throughout the world have shifted, with some areas becoming wetter and
other drier; tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic has increased; and peak runoff timing of many glacial
and snow fed rivers has shifted earlier. Though it is difficult to prove a definitive cause and effect relationship
between global warming and other observed changes to natural systems, there is high confidence in the scientific
community that these changes are a direct result of increased global temperatures (IPCC 2007:3). This basic
conclusion has been endorsed by more than 45 scientific societies and academies of science, including all of the

national academies of science of the major industrialized countries. Since 2007, no scientific body of national or
international standing has maintained a dissenting opinion.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Sources and Inventory
CO2e is a measurement used to account for the fact that different GHGs have different potential to retain infrared
radiation in the atmosphere and contribute to the greenhouse effect. This potential, known as the global warming
potential (GWP) of a GHG, depends on the lifetime, or persistence, of a gas molecule in the atmosphere. For
example, as described in Appendix C, “Calculation References,” of the General Reporting Protocol of the
California Climate Action Registry (CCAR) (CCAR 2009:Appendix C), 1 ton of CH4 has the same contribution
to the greenhouse effect as approximately 23 tons of CO2. Therefore, CH4 is a much more potent GHG than CO2.
Expressing emissions in CO2e takes the contributions of all GHG emissions to the greenhouse effect and converts
them to a single unit equivalent to the effect that would occur if only CO2 were being emitted.
Emissions of CO2 are byproducts of fossil-fuel combustion. CH4, a highly potent GHG, results from off-gassing
(the release of chemicals from nonmetallic substances under ambient or greater pressure conditions) largely
associated with agricultural practices and landfills. CO2 sinks, or reservoirs, include vegetation and the ocean,
which respectively absorb CO2 through photosynthesis and dissolution, two of the most common processes of
CO2 sequestration.
California
California is the 12th to 16th largest emitter of CO2 in the world (CEC 2006:1). In California, the transportation
sector is the largest emitter of GHGs, followed by electricity generation (CEC 2006:1). California produced 484
million gross MT of CO2 equivalent in 2004. Combustion of fossil fuel in the transportation sector was the single
largest source of California’s GHG emissions in 2004, accounting for 41 percent of total GHG emissions in the
State (CEC 2006:1). This sector was followed by the electric power sector (including both in-state and out-of­
state sources) (22 percent) and the industrial sector (21 percent) (CEC 2006:1).

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES AND MITIGATION MEASURES

SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA
For this analysis, significance criteria are based on the checklist presented in Appendix G of the State CEQA
Guidelines; the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist; and regulatory standards of federal and state agencies as
well as EDCAQMD. These criteria also encompass the factors taken into account under NEPA to determine the
significance of an action in terms of the context and intensity of its effects.
CEQA Criteria
Under CEQA, an alternative was determined to result in a significant effect related to air quality if it would:
►

conflict with or obstruct implementation of the applicable air quality plan (CEQA 1);

►

violate any air quality standard or contribute substantially to an existing or projected air quality violation
(Table 3.2-1) (CEQA 2);

►

result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria air pollutant for which the project region is in
nonattainment under any applicable national or state ambient air quality standards (including releasing
emissions that exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone precursors) (CEQA 3);

►

expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations (including TACs/HAPs) (CEQA 4); or

Air Quality

3.2-22

California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

►

create objectionable odors affecting a substantial number or people (CEQA 5).

Cumulatively considerable effects, including those related to CEQA 3, are discussed in Section 3.18, “Cumulative
Effects.”
As stated in Appendix G, the significance criteria established by the applicable AQMD or APCD may be relied
upon to make the above determinations. Thus, as identified by EDCAQMD, an alternative was determined to
result in a significant impact related to air quality if:
►

short-term construction-related or long-term operation-related (regional) emissions of ROG or NOX were to
exceed mass emissions of 82 pounds per day (lb/day) (EDCAQMD 2002) or other criteria air pollutants (i.e.,
CO, PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, sulfates, lead, or hydrogen sulfide) would exceed a national or state ambient air
quality standard(s) (CEQA 6).

Under CEQA an alternative was determined to result in a significant effect related to greenhouse gases if it would:
►

generate greenhouse gas emissions, either directly or indirectly, that may have a significant impact on the
environment (CEQA 7); or

►

Conflict with any applicable plan, policy or regulation of an agency adopted for the purpose of reducing the
emissions of greenhouse gases (CEQA 8).

NEPA Criteria
An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the
environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the proposed action. Under NEPA, the significance
of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account
under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are
encompassed by the CEQA criteria used for this analysis.
TRPA Criteria
Based on TRPA’s Initial Environmental Checklist, an alternative was determined to have a significant impact
related to air quality if it would result in:
►

substantial air pollutant emissions (TRPA 1);

►

deterioration of ambient (existing) air quality (TRPA 2);

►

the creation of objectionable odors (TRPA3);

►

alteration of air movement, moisture or temperature, or any change in climate, either locally or regionally
(TRPA 4); or

►

increased use of diesel fuel (TRPA 5).

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
Almost all increased pollutant emissions that would be associated with the improvements within the study area
would be generated by construction-related activities. The number of visitors to the study area is not expected to
change substantially, with Alternative 1 (maximum recreation) resulting in the greatest increase, Alternative 2 the
smallest, and Alternatives 3 and 4 in between. Construction emissions are described as short term in duration.

These emissions, especially emissions of criteria air pollutants (i.e., PM10) and ozone precursors (e.g., ROG and
NOX), have the potential to represent a significant air quality impact.
Fugitive dust emissions are associated primarily with site preparation and excavation and vary as a function of
such parameters as soil silt content, soil moisture, wind speed, acreage of disturbance area, and vehicle miles
traveled (VMT) on-site and off-site. Emissions of ROG and NOX are associated primarily with gas and diesel
equipment and asphalt paving.
The method of analysis for short-term construction, long-term operational (regional), local mobile-source, and
TAC emissions is consistent with the recommendations of EDCAQMD and TRPA.
Greenhouse Gases
The EDAQMD has not adopted significance criteria for analyzing GHG emissions generated by development, or
a methodology for analyzing impacts related to GHG emissions or global climate change. By enactment of AB 32
and SB 97, the State of California has identified GHG reduction goals and determined that the effect of GHG
emissions on global climate change is an adverse environmental impact issue. While the emissions of one single
project will not cause global climate change, GHG emissions from multiple projects throughout the world could
result in a cumulative impact with respect to global climate change.
To meet AB 32 goals, California would need to generate less GHG emissions than current levels. It is recognized,
however, that for most projects there is no simple metric available to determine if a single project would
substantially increase or decrease overall GHG emission levels.
Although the text of AB 32 applies to stationary sources of GHG emissions, this mandate demonstrates
California’s commitment to reducing the rate of GHG emissions and the State’s associated contribution to climate
change, without intent to limit population or economic growth within the State. Thus, to achieve the goals of AB
32, which are tied to GHG emission rates of specific benchmark years (e.g., 1990), California would have to
achieve a lower rate of emissions per unit of population than it has now. Further, in order to accommodate future
population and economic growth, the state would have to achieve an even lower rate of emissions per unit than
was achieved in 1990. (The goal to achieve 1990 quantities of GHG emissions by 2020 means that this will need
to be accomplished with 30 years of population and economic growth beyond 1990 in place.) Thus, future
planning efforts that would not encourage reductions in GHG emissions would conflict with the policy decisions
contained in the spirit of AB 32, thus impeding California’s ability to comply with the mandate.
The State of California has established GHG reduction targets and has determined that GHG emissions as they
relate to global climate change are a source of adverse environmental impacts in California that should be
addressed under CEQA. Although AB 32 did not amend CEQA, it identifies the myriad of environmental
problems in California caused by global warming (Health and Safety Code, Section 38501[a]). SB 97, however,
did amend CEQA by directing OPR to prepare revisions to the State CEQA Guidelines addressing the mitigation
of GHGs or their consequences. As an interim step toward development of required guidelines, in June of 2008,
OPR published a technical advisory, entitled “CEQA and Climate Change: Addressing Climate Change Through
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Review.” OPR recommends that the lead agencies under CEQA
make a good-faith effort, based on available information, to estimate the quantity of GHG emissions that would
be generated by a proposed project, including the emissions associated with vehicular traffic, energy
consumption, water usage, and construction activities, to determine whether the impacts have the potential to
result in a project or cumulative impact and to mitigate the impacts where feasible (OPR 2008).
In that document, OPR acknowledged that “perhaps the most difficult part of the climate change analysis will be
the determination of significance,” and noted that “OPR has asked ARB technical staff to recommend a method
for setting criteria which will encourage consistency and uniformity in the CEQA analysis of GHG emissions
throughout the state.” ARB has not yet completed this task at the time of writing.

The EDAQMD has not adopted a methodology for evaluating GHG emissions. In the case of the proposed
project, CO2 emissions associated with project construction and operation were modeled using URBEMIS 2007
version 9.2.4; a model widely-used in regional air quality analysis.
It is important to note that all CO2 emissions from project operation may not necessarily be considered “new”
emissions, given that a project itself does not create “new” emitters (people) of GHGs, at least not in the
traditional sense. In other words, the operational GHG emissions for this project are not necessarily all new GHG
emissions; to a large degree, restoration projects accommodate existing populations. In this sense, restoration
projects can be seen as repairing previous environments, and are not in themselves creators of economic and
population growth. Emissions of GHGs are, however, influenced by the location and design of projects, to the
extent that they can influence travel to and from the projects, and to the degree that project construction
contributes to GHG levels.
The methodology used in this document to analyze the project’s potential effect on global warming includes a
calculation of GHG emissions. The purpose of calculating the project’s GHG emissions is for informational and
comparison purposes, as there is no adopted quantifiable threshold applicable to either the project level or
cumulative level of impact.
Please also refer to Section 3.18, “Cumulative Impacts,” of this EIR/EIS/EIS for discussion of greenhouse gas
emissions and the project’s contribution to the cumulative impact on climate change.

EFFECTS NOT DISCUSSED FURTHER IN THIS EIR/EIS/EIS
Air Movement, Moisture (TRPA 4)—The alternatives would have only negligible effects on air movement,
moisture or temperature, or on climate, either locally or regionally. None of the alternatives include buildings,
other structures or include activities that could cause such effects. (The effects on greenhouse gas emissions,
however, are discussed further.)

IMPACT ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
Alternative 1: Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
IMPACT
3.2-1
(Alt. 1)

Short-Term Emissions of Criteria Air Pollutants and Precursors during Construction. (CEQA 1, 2, 6;
TRPA 1, 2) Construction-related emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursors under Alternative 1 could
contribute substantially to an existing or projected air quality violation and expose sensitive receptors to
substantial pollutant concentrations, especially considering the nonattainment status of the LTAB with
respect to TRPA standards. However, as described in Environmental Commitment 1, the Conservancy will
apply several measures to reduce the generation of construction-related emissions of ROG, NOX, and PM10.
Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

Construction emissions are described as short term in duration and have the potential to represent a significant
impact with respect to air quality. Fugitive PM10 dust emissions are associated primarily with site preparation and
vary as a function of such parameters as soil silt content, soil moisture, wind speed, acreage of disturbance area,
and VMT by construction vehicles on- and off-site. Emissions of the ozone precursors ROG and NOX emissions
are associated primarily with exhaust from gas- and diesel-powered equipment and the application of architectural
coatings.
Under Alternative 1, the study area restoration and building phases of construction would temporarily generate
emissions of criteria air pollutants (e.g., PM10) and precursors (e.g., ROG and NOX) from excavation, grading, and
clearing; use of off-road equipment; import and export of materials; paving; and exhaust from workers’ commute
vehicles.

Short-term construction-related emissions of ROG, NOX, and PM10 under Alternative 1 were modeled using the
ARB-approved URBEMIS 2007 (Version 9.2.4) computer program and EMFAC 2007 emission factors as
recommended by EDCAQMD and TRPA. URBEMIS is designed to model construction emissions for land use
development projects and allows for the input of project-specific information. Input parameters were based on
default model settings and information provided in Chapter 2, “Project Alternatives.” Project construction is
anticipated to be carried out in four phases. Modeling conducted for this analysis forecasted a construction start
date of Summer 2015. Modeling assumed an annual construction period of May 1–October 15 (120 work days)
and used the corresponding emission factors. The final construction phase would occur in 2018. Construction
emissions would cease following completion of the final construction phase. The modeled maximum daily
construction-related emissions are summarized in Table 3.2-6 and described in more detail below and in
Appendix F.
Based on the modeling conducted, in the worst-case scenario, construction of Alternative 1 would result in
maximum unmitigated daily emissions of approximately 8.5 lb/day of ROG, 60.4 lb/day of NOX, and 96.9 lb/day
of PM10 (Table 3.2-6). (These quantities would be less than those for Alternative 4, and similar to those for
Alternatives 2 and 3 [except that for Alternative 2 PM10 emissions would be greater than for Alternatives 1 and
3].) The daily unmitigated, construction-related emissions for Alternative 1 would not exceed EDCAQMD’s
short-term significance criterion of 82 lb/day for ROG and NOX. EDCAQMD considers projects that generate
daily ROG and NOX emissions below the significance criteria to not adversely impact the region’s commitment
and plan to attain the federal ozone standard.
With implementation of Environmental Commitment (EC) 1, “Reduce the Generation of Construction-Related
Emissions of ROG, NOX, and PM10,” described in Table 2-6, construction-related emissions of PM10 under
Alternative 1 would not violate or contribute substantially to an existing or projected air quality violation. The
EDCAQMD considers projects that implement sufficient mitigation measures (or environmental commitments)
that would prevent visible PM10 dust beyond the project property lines to generate less than significant PM10
emissions. Therefore, with the inclusion of EC 1, construction-related PM10 would be considered less than
significant. As described in Significance Criteria, projects that would not generate emissions of other criteria air
pollutants that exceed a national or state ambient air quality standard (see Table 3.2-1) would be considered less
than significant. Therefore, implementation of EC 1 would ensure that emissions of the other major constructionrelated pollutants (e.g., PM10) would not exceed an applicable ambient air quality standard. Furthermore, as
determined by SMAQMD, implementing EC 1 (i.e., SMAQMD Enhanced Fugitive PM Dust Control Practices)
would reduce construction-related fugitive PM10 dust emissions by a minimum of approximately 75 percent and
would prevent the fugitive PM10 dust from dispersing beyond the property boundary (SMAQMD
2009:Chapter 3). Implementation of this environmental commitment would also reduce exhaust emissions of
NOX, and PM10 from diesel equipment by 20 and 45 percent, respectively (SMAQMD 2009:Chapter 3).
This impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.2-2
(Alt. 1)

Long-Term Operational (Regional) Emissions of Criteria Air Pollutants and Precursors. (CEQA 1, 2;
TRPA 1, 2) Long-term operational emissions would not exceed TRPA’s significance criteria for stationary
sources or the EDCAQMD-recommended significance criterion for mass emissions of NOX. Therefore,
implementation of Alternative 1 would not violate an air quality standard, contribute substantially to an
existing or projected air quality violation, expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations,
or conflict with or obstruct implementation of the applicable air quality plan. This impact would be less than
significant.

Regional emissions of ROG, NOX, PM10, CO, and SOX from stationary, area, and mobile sources associated with
project implementation were estimated using the URBEMIS 2007 (Version 9.4.2) computer program, which is
designed to model emissions for land use development projects (including recreation land uses). URBEMIS
allows project location specifics and trip generation rates to be selected. The program accounts for stationary- and
area-source emissions from the use of natural gas, wood stoves, fireplaces, landscape maintenance equipment, and

stationary, area (e.g., landscaping equipment), and mobile sources were estimated based on proposed land use
types and sizes identified in Chapter 2, “Project Alternatives,” the net increase in trip generation from the
project’s transportation analysis described in Section 3.16, “Transportation, Parking, and Circulation” (e.g., fewer
than 100 daily vehicle trips), and the default model setting for 2014 conditions. None of the alternatives are
expected to generate more than additional 10 to 20 additional trips per day. Original modeling was performed by
AECOM in 2008 using default model settings, and trip generation rates and trip lengths obtained from the
transportation analysis. While the original modeling used an operational year earlier than the currently anticipated
construction year of 2015, it continues to represent a conservative estimate of operational emissions. Trips are not
anticipated to increase over those estimates included in the original modeling, and emission factors for motor
vehicles are anticipated to decrease in future years (e.g., 2030) due to rules and regulations adopted by EPA, ARB
and TRPA. Therefore, operational emissions occurring after the modeled year of 2014 would result in lower
emissions than those presented in Table 3.2-7.

The modeled maximum daily operational emissions under Alternative 1 are summarized in Table 3.2-7 and
described in more detail below and in Appendix F. Estimates are conservative, and actual emissions could be less
over time as a result of fluctuations in activity and maintenance.
Based on the modeling conducted, worst-case project operations under Alternative 1 would result in maximum
unmitigated daily emissions of approximately 1.31 lb/day of ROG, 1.90 lb/day of NOX, 0.07 lb/day of PM10,
14.75 lb/day of CO, and 0.01 lb/day of SOX, none of which would exceed the applicable EDCAQMD threshold
(Table 3.2-7). These thresholds are based on SIP requirements to reduce emissions from heavy-duty vehicles and
land use projects. Because project implementation would not exceed these thresholds, Alternative 1 would not
conflict with air quality planning efforts. In addition, because the project’s operational emissions of NOX would

not exceed the EDCAQMD NOX threshold, Alternative 1 would not affect TRPA’s attainment designation for
atmospheric deposition.
Long-term operational emissions under Alternative 1 would not violate an air quality standard, contribute
substantially to an existing or projected air quality violation, expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant
concentrations, or conflict with or obstruct implementation of the applicable air quality plan. This impact would
be less than significant.

(Alt. 1)

Long-Term Operational (Local) Emissions of Carbon Monoxide by Mobile Sources. (CEQA 1, 2; TRPA
1, 2) Long-term local emissions of CO from mobile sources related to project operation under Alternative 1
would not violate an air quality standard (i.e., the eight-hour TRPA standard of 6 ppm), contribute
substantially to an existing or projected air quality violation, or expose sensitive receptors to substantial
pollutant concentrations. This impact would be less than significant.

CO concentration is a direct function of motor vehicle activity (e.g., idling time and traffic flow conditions),
particularly during peak commute hours, and meteorological conditions. Under specific meteorological
conditions, CO concentrations may reach unhealthy levels with respect to local sensitive land uses such as
residential areas, schools, and hospitals. As a result, the analysis of CO emissions is at a local level.
The Transportation Project-Level Carbon Monoxide Protocol (Garza, Graney, and Sperling 1997) states that
signalized intersections that operate at an unacceptable level of service (LOS) represent a potential for a CO
violation, also known as a “hot spot,” and thus undergo a quantitative screening-level analysis. The Goals and
Policies in the TRPA Regional Plan indicate that up to four hours of LOS E conditions are acceptable at a
signalized intersection (TRPA 1987:III-6). No TRPA standard exists for the operation of unsignalized
intersections. Thus, an analysis of CO concentrations is typically recommended for receptors located near
signalized intersections that are projected to operate at LOS E (for more than four hours per day) or LOS F.
According to the transportation analysis, operation of Alternative 1 would not reduce the LOS at any signalized
intersections to an unacceptable level (LOS E or F) during any time of the day or substantially worsen LOS at any
signalized intersections (see Section 3.16, “Transportation, Parking, and Circulation,” for additional detail). Thus,
long-term local emissions of CO from mobile sources during project operation under Alternative 1 would not
violate an air quality standard (i.e., the eight-hour TRPA standard of 6 ppm), contribute substantially to an
existing or projected air quality violation, or expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations. As
a result, this impact would be less than significant.

Exposure of Sensitive Receptors to Odors. (CEQA 5, TRPA 3) Neither construction nor operation of
Alternative 1 would create objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of people. This impact would
be less than significant.

Implementation of Alternative 1 would not result in any major sources of odor, and the project’s proposed land
use type is not one of the types commonly known to generate odors (e.g., landfill, coffee roaster, wastewater
treatment plant). Emissions of diesel exhaust from the use of on-site construction equipment would be intermittent
and short term, and the exhaust would dissipate rapidly from the source. Thus, neither construction nor operation
of Alternative 1 would create objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of people. As a result, this
impact would be less than significant.

Exposure of Sensitive Receptors to Emissions of Hazardous Air Pollutants. (CEQA 4) Neither
construction nor operation of Alternative 1 would expose sensitive receptors to substantial emissions of
HAPs (TACs). As a result, this impact would be less than significant.

Construction of Alternative 1 would result in the short-term emission of diesel exhaust by on-site heavy-duty
equipment. In January 2001, EPA promulgated a final rule to reduce emissions standards for heavy-duty diesel
engines beginning with the 2007 model year. These emissions standards represent emissions reductions of 90
percent for NOX, 72 percent for nonmethane hydrocarbons, and 90 percent for PM relative to the emissions
standards for the 2004 model year.
The dose of a substance in the environment to which receptors are exposed—a function of the substance’s
concentration and the duration of exposure—is the primary factor used to determine the health risks associated
with HAPs (known in state parlance as TACs). Dose is positively correlated with time; that is, a longer exposure
period would result in a higher exposure level. Thus, the estimated risks are higher if a fixed exposure occurs over
a longer period of time. According to California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, health risk
assessments, which determine the exposure of sensitive receptors to HAP emissions, should be based on a 70-year
exposure period; however, such assessments should be limited to the period and duration of activities associated
with the project (Salinas, pers. comm., 2004). Because off-road heavy-duty diesel equipment would be used only
temporarily, and because of the highly dispersive properties of diesel PM (Zhu et al. 2002) and future reductions
in exhaust emissions, construction under Alternative 1 would not expose sensitive receptors to substantial
emissions of HAPs.
No major stationary sources of HAP emissions would be constructed or operated with long-term operation of
Alternative 1, nor would this alternative result in the generation of HAP emissions from on-site mobile sources
(e.g., diesel truck traffic). In addition, no major sources of HAPs exist in the vicinity of the study area.
Nonetheless, all stationary sources with the potential to emit HAPs are required to obtain permits from TRPA.
Permits may be granted to these operations if they are constructed and operated in accordance with applicable
regulations, specifically Section 65.1 (Air Quality Control) of the TRPA Code of Ordinances. Given that
compliance with applicable standards is required for the development and operation of facilities that may emit
HAPs, emissions in the study area are expected to remain within established standards. Thus, neither construction
nor operation of Alternative 1 would expose sensitive receptors to substantial emissions of HAPs. As a result, this
impact would be less than significant.

Short-Term or Long-Term Operational (Regional) Emissions of GHGs. (CEQA 7, CEQA 8)
Implementation of the project would not result in the generation of substantial short-term construction or
long-term operation-related emissions of GHGs. When considered in conjunction with other projects
throughout the region, the proposed project’s emissions would not affect GHG reduction planning efforts.
Therefore, GHG emissions from the proposed project would be less than significant.

Construction-related GHG emissions were estimated for each alternative using URBEMIS 2007, Version 9.2.4.
Operation-related emissions, including direct (e.g., maintenance) and indirect (e.g., vehicle trips) emissions were
also calculated using URBEMIS 2007.
Construction-Generated Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Activities associated with construction of Alternative 1would occur during a period of approximately 4 years.
During this time, construction-related GHG emissions would be associated with engine exhaust from heavy-duty
construction equipment, material transport trucks, and worker commute trips. Although any increase in GHG
emissions would add to the quantity of emissions that contribute to global climate change, emissions associated
with construction of the project would occur over a limited period. Following full completion of the project, all
construction emissions would cease. Despite the intensity and duration of construction activities, and the lack of
available mitigation measures to abate GHG emissions from heavy-duty construction equipment and on-road
hauling emissions, the incremental contribution to climate change by the project’s construction emissions would
be short term and minimal.

To establish additional context in which to consider the magnitude of project-generated construction-related GHG
emissions, it may be noted that facilities (i.e., stationary, continuous sources of GHG emissions) in California that
generate greater than 25,000 MT of CO2 per year are mandated to report their GHG emissions to the ARB
pursuant to AB 32. As shown in Table 3.2-8, estimated GHG emissions associated with construction of the
project would be a maximum of 449 MT of CO2 per year under the conditions for the highest emitting alternative
(Year 3 of Alternative 4).

The values presented do not include the full life-cycle of GHG emissions that occur over the production/transport of materials used during
construction of the project, solid waste that occurs over the life of the project, and the end-of-life of the materials and processes that
indirectly result from the project. Estimation of the GHG emissions associated with these processes would be speculative, would require
analysis beyond the current state of the art in impact assessment, and may lead to a false or misleading level of precision in reporting of
project-related GHG emissions.
2
Construction emissions were modeled with the URBEMIS 2007 computer model. The URBEMIS 2007 model does not account for CO 2
emissions associated with the production of concrete or other building materials used in project construction. It also does not estimate
emissions for GHGs other than CO2, such as CH4 and N2O, because the emission levels of these other GHGs are expected to be nominal
in comparison to the estimated CO2 levels despite their higher global warming potential.
See Appendix F, “Air Quality Modeling Results,” for detailed model input, assumptions, and threshold calculations.

The project would generate substantially less emissions than the ARB reporting level of 25,000 MT of CO2 per
year and the cap-and-trade level of 10,000 MT of CO2 per year set by AB 32. This information is presented for
informational purposes only, and it is not the intention of the Conservancy to adopt 25,000 or 10,000 MT of CO2
per year as a numeric threshold. Rather, the intention is to put project-generated GHG emissions in the
appropriate context to evaluate whether the project’s contribution to the global impact of climate change is
considered substantial. Because construction-related emissions under all alternatives would be short term,
minimal, and finite in nature (i.e., would not be continuing) and would not approach emissions levels of concern
to agencies that have established emission reporting levels, the project’s construction-related GHG emissions
would not be substantial and would not conflict with state and local planning efforts. This impact would be less
than significant.
Operation-Related GHG Emissions
Operation-related GHG emissions would be generated by area and mobile sources during the life of the project.
Area-source GHG emissions would be associated with maintenance largely related to maintaining public access
infrastructure, waste disposal, and other miscellaneous activities. Existing maintenance programs would continue
as they do today under Alternative 5. The largest increase in emissions would occur under Alternative 1, which

would entail the most public access facilities in the study area. No alternative would involve municipal water use,
and therefore, the proposed project would not generate off-site GHG emissions associated with water conveyance,
treatment, and consumption. Quantification of sequestration of carbon by vegetation is not feasible without an
accurate inventory of vegetation types and sequestration rates. Nonetheless, it was assumed that carbon
sequestration would remain similar to existing conditions because the site would remain in natural vegetation, and
although some changes in vegetation type would likely reduce sequestration rates in small areas (e.g., where
Jeffrey pine forest would be replaced with other vegetation), other changes in vegetation type in large areas would
likely increase carbon sequestration rates (e.g., conversion of montane meadow to willow-scrub). Mobile-source
GHG emissions would be generated by the slight increase in project-related vehicle trips associated with the
improvements to public access infrastructure in the study area attracting some additional visitors. Table 3.2-9
presents the operation-related GHG emissions associated with Alternative 1, the highest emitting alternative.
Estimates of mobile-source GHG emissions are based on the traffic analysis prepared for the project, which
estimates less than 100 additional trips per day under Alternative 1, compared to existing conditions, which are
associated with an increase in recreational users.

Direct operation-related emissions (i.e., area and mobile sources) were modeled using the URBEMIS 2007 computer model, based on trip
generation rates obtained from the traffic analysis, as well as the other assumptions and input parameters used to estimate criteria air
pollutant emissions. Mobile source emissions assume nine trips per day above existing conditions. Year 2018 is the earliest year when
completion of the project would likely occur. URBEMIS does not estimate emissions for GHGs other than CO2, such as CH4 and NO2,
because the emission levels of these other GHGs are expected to be nominal in comparison to the estimated CO 2 levels despite their
higher global warming potential.

Estimation of mobile-source emissions is based on the traffic study, which assumes four additional employees per day (nine additional

For context (as with construction emissions), projects that generate more than 25,000 MT of CO2 per year are
mandated to report GHG emissions to ARB pursuant to AB 32. As shown in Table 3.2-9 the estimated increase in
GHG emissions associated with operation of Alternative 2 would be approximately 12 MT of CO2 per year.
Again, the proposed project would generate substantially fewer emissions than the above-referenced threshold
levels of 25,000 and 10,000 MT of CO2 per year. Because operation-related emissions would not approach the
recommended thresholds of ARB and legislation that have established screening levels, the project’s GHG
emissions would not be substantial and would not conflict with state and local planning efforts. This impact
would be less than significant.

Short-Term Emissions of Criteria Air Pollutants and Precursors during Construction. (CEQA 1, 2, 6;

Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

Short-term construction-related emissions of ROG, NOX, and PM10 under Alternative 2 were modeled using the
ARB-approved URBEMIS 2007 (Version 9.2.4) computer program and EMFAC 2007 emission factors as
recommended by EDCAQMD and TRPA. URBEMIS is designed to model construction emissions for land use
development projects and allows for the input of project-specific information. Input parameters were based on
default model settings and information provided in Chapter 2, “Project Alternatives.” Project construction is
anticipated to be carried out in four phases. The first phase is anticipated to begin in May 2015, with final project
completion in October 2018. Modeling assumed an annual construction period of May 1–October 15 (120 work
days) starting in 2015. The modeled maximum daily construction-related emissions are summarized in Table 3.2­
6 and described in more detail below and in Appendix F.
Based on the modeling conducted, in the worst-case scenario, construction of Alternative 2 would result in
maximum unmitigated daily emissions of approximately 7.2 lb/day of ROG, 53.4 lb/day of NOX, and 148.5 lb/day
of PM10 (Table 3.2-6). (These quantities of ROG and NOX would be similar to those for Alternative 1; this
quantity of PM10 emissions would be greater than the quantity for Alternative 1.) Daily unmitigated, constructionrelated emissions for Alternative 2 would not exceed EDCAQMD’s short-term significance criterion of 82 lb/day
for ROG and NOX.
With implementation of EC 1, described in Table 2-6, construction-related emissions of PM10 under Alternative 1

Short-term construction-related emissions of ROG, NOX, and PM10 under Alternative 3 were modeled using the

recommended by EDCAQMD and TRPA. URBEMIS is designed to model construction emissions for land use

potential to represent a significant short-term impact with respect to air quality. Under Alternative 4, the initial
site preparation and building phases of construction would temporarily generate emissions of criteria air
pollutants (e.g., PM10) and precursors (e.g., ROG and NOX) from excavation, grading, and clearing; use of offroad equipment; import and export of materials; paving; application of architectural coatings; and exhaust from
workers’ commute vehicles.
Alternative 4 involves the cut of 104,844 cubic yards more material than the next highest alternative (Alternative
2) to reduce the grade of the corridor along the river channel to create a new floodplain. The removal of extra
material to reduce the elevation of a broad corridor along the river would result in addition construction
equipment moving the materials on the project site. Consequently, the level of construction emissions is
substantially greater for Alternative 4 than other alternatives. Therefore, as described above, actual projected
construction years were used to model Alternative 4’s construction emissions in order to avoid grossly
overestimating emissions.
Short-term construction-related emissions of ROG, NOX, and PM10 under Alternative 4 were modeled using the
ARB-approved URBEMIS 2007 (Version 9.2.4) computer program and EMFAC 2007 emission factors as
recommended by TRPA. URBEMIS is designed to model construction emissions for land use development
projects and allows for the input of project-specific information. Input parameters were based on default model
settings and information provided in Chapter 2, “Project Alternatives.” Project construction is anticipated to be
carried out in four phases. The first phase is anticipated to begin in May 2015, with final project completion in
October 2018. Modeling assumed an annual construction period of May 1–October 15 (120 work days) starting in
2015 and used the corresponding emission factors. The modeled maximum daily construction-related emissions
are summarized in Table 3.2-6 and described in more detail below and in Appendix F.
Based on the modeling conducted, construction of Alternative 4 would result in maximum unmitigated daily
emissions of approximately 8.7 lb/day of ROG, 62.0 lb/day of NOX, and 386.9 lb/day of PM10 (Table 3.2-6).
Daily unmitigated, construction-related emissions for Alternative 4 would not exceed EDCAQMD’s short-term
significance threshold of 82 lb/day for ROG or NOX. With implementation of EC 1, described in Table 2-6,
construction-related emissions from Impact 3.2-1 (Alt. 4) would reduce fugitive PM10 dust emissions by a
minimum of approximately 75 percent and prevent dispersion of fugitive PM10 dust beyond the property
boundary. This impact would be less than significant.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL RESOURCES

This section analyzes the effects of the project on archaeological and historical resources located within or
adjacent to the study area. This analysis does all of the following:
►

describes the criteria for determining the significance of cultural resources, including standards provided in
NEPA, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (referred to in this section as “Section 106”),
CEQA, and the TRPA Code of Ordinances;

►

provides an inventory of known archaeological and historical resources on the study area;

►

summarizes previous archaeological investigations; and

►

evaluates the potential impacts of the project on known and unknown significant archaeological and/or
historical resources and identifies feasible mitigation measures that would reduce those impacts to less-than­
significant levels.

For the purposes of this analysis, cultural resources include historic, prehistoric, and archaeological resources.
Cumulative cultural resource impacts are addressed in Section 3.16, “Cumulative Impacts.” Consistency with
TRPA goals and policies is presented in Section 3.10, “Land Use,” Table 3.10-1.

3.3.1

AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

REGULATORY SETTING
Federal
NEPA Guidelines
In accordance with NEPA, an agency must consider:
►

unique characteristics of the geographic area, such as proximity to historic or cultural resources (40 Code of
Federal Regulations [CFR] 1508), and

►

the degree to which the action may adversely affect districts, sites, highways, structures, or objects listed in or
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) (40 CFR 1508.27[b][8]).

The following federal law related to archeological and historical resources is relevant to the project alternatives
and is described in detail in Chapter 5, “Compliance, Consultation, and Coordination”:
►

Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.

Regulations relevant to the proposed alternatives are described in detail in Chapter 5, “Compliance, Consultation,
and Coordination.”
State
CEQA offers directives regarding project-related impacts on historical resources and unique archaeological
resources located within California. It states generally that if implementing a project would result in significant
environmental impacts, public agencies should consider whether feasible mitigation measures or feasible
alternatives can substantially lessen or avoid such impacts. This general mandate applies equally to significant
environmental effects related to certain cultural resources.

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Archaeological and Historical Resources

Only significant cultural resources (“historical resources” and “unique archaeological resources”) need to be
addressed. The State CEQA Guidelines define a “historical resource” as, among other things, “[a] resource listed
in, or determined to be eligible by the State Historical Resources Commission, for listing in the California
Register of Historical Resources” (CRHR) (State CEQA Guidelines, Section 15064.5[a][1]; see also Public
Resources Code Sections 5024.1 and 21084.1.) A historical resource may be eligible for inclusion in the CRHR,
as determined by the State Historical Resources Commission or the lead agency, if the resource:
►

is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of California’s history
and cultural heritage;

►

is associated with the lives of persons important in our past;

►

embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or method of construction, or represents the
work of an important creative individual, or possesses high artistic values; or

►

has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.

In addition, a resource is presumed to constitute a “historical resource” if it is included in a “local register of
historical resources” unless “the preponderance of evidence demonstrates that it is not historically or culturally
significant” (State CEQA Guidelines, Section 15064.5[a][2]).
CEQA (California Public Resources Code Section 21083.2) and the State CEQA Guidelines (Section 15064.5)
also require consideration of unique archaeological sites. As stated in Section 21083.2 of the Public Resources
Code, a “unique archaeological resource” is defined as “an archaeological artifact, object, or site about which it
can be clearly demonstrated that, without merely adding to the current body of knowledge, there is a high
probability that it meets any of the following criteria:
(1)

“Contains information needed to answer important scientific research questions and that there is a
demonstrable public interest in that information.”

(2)

“Has a special and particular quality such as being the oldest of its type or the best available example of its
type.”

(3)

“Is directly associated with a scientifically recognized important prehistoric or historic event or person.”

If an archaeological site does not meet any of the criteria for inclusion in the CRHR but does meet the definition
of a unique archaeological resource as outlined in Public Resources Code Section 21083.2 of CEQA, it is entitled
to special protection or attention under CEQA. Treatment options under Section 21083.2 include activities that
preserve such resources in place in an undisturbed state. Other acceptable methods of mitigation include
excavation and curation or study in place without excavation and curation (if the study finds that the artifacts
would not meet one or more of the criteria for defining a “unique archaeological resource”).
Section 15064.5(e) of the State CEQA Guidelines requires that excavation activities be stopped whenever human
remains are uncovered and that the county coroner be called in to assess the remains. If the county coroner
determines that the remains are those of Native Americans, the Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC)
must be contacted within 24 hours. At that time, in accordance with Section 15064.5(d), the lead agency must
consult with the appropriate Native Americans as identified by the NAHC; under certain circumstances, the lead
agency is to develop an agreement with the Native Americans for the treatment and disposition of the remains.

Tahoe Regional Planning Agency
Goals and Policies
The Goals and Policies document of the 1987 Regional Plan establishes an overall framework for development
and environmental conservation in the Lake Tahoe region. Chapter IV (Conservation Element) of the Goals and
Policies document considers ten subelements selected to cover the full range of Lake Tahoe’s natural and
historical resources. The sole goal (Goal #1) in the Cultural Subelement of this chapter calls for sites of historical,
cultural, and architectural significance within the region to be identified and preserved. There are two policies
under Goal #1: Policy 1 requires TRPA to establish a list of significant historical, cultural, and architectural sites
and special-review criteria to protect such sites; and Policy 2 stipulates that these sites be given special incentives
and exemptions to promote the preservation and restoration of such structures and sites.
Code of Ordinances
In compliance with federal and state laws, TRPA has adopted guidelines to determine cultural resources
significance and impacts in the Tahoe Basin. Chapter 67 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances states that “sites,
objects, structures, districts or other resources of historical, cultural, archaeological, paleontological, or
architectural significance locally, regionally, state-wide, or nationally” shall meet at least one of the following
criteria:
►

resources that are associated with historically significant events and sites, such as an important community
function in the past or a memorable happening in the past, or that contain qualities reminiscent of an early
stage of development in the region (Section 67.6.1);

►

resources associated with the lives of persons significant in history, including regional history, including
buildings or structures associated with a locally, regionally, or nationally known person; notable examples or
best surviving works of a pioneer architect, designer, or master builder; or structures associated with the life
or work of significant persons (Section 67.6.2);

►

resources that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction; that possess
high artistic values; or that represent a significant or distinguishable entity but whose components may lack
individual distinction (Section 67.6.3);

►

archaeological or paleontological resources protected or eligible for protection under state or federal
guidelines (Section 67.6.4); or

►

prehistoric archaeological or paleontological resources that may contribute to the basic understanding of early
cultural or biological development in the region (Section 67.6.5).

Section 67.3 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances requires the protection of sites, objects, structures, or other
resources designated as historic resources or for which designation is pending. Such resources may not be
demolished, disturbed, removed, or significantly altered unless TRPA has approved a resource protection plan to
protect the historic resources. Section 67.3.3 requires that the resource protection plan be prepared by a qualified
professional and states that the plan may provide for surface or subsurface recovery of data and artifacts and
recordation of structural and other data. Section 67.3.4 requires that resources be protected during construction;
grading, operation of equipment, or other soil disturbance is prohibited in areas where a designated historic
resource is present or could be damaged, except in accordance with a TRPA-approved resource protection plan
(TRPA 2011).
Section 33.3.7 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances addresses the discovery of historic resources during grading
activities. This section requires project-related grading to cease and project proponents to notify TRPA if
construction contractors encounter resources that appear to be 50 years old or older. TRPA would suspend

grading and consult with appropriate federal, state, or local entities to determine the significance of the resource,
if any. The property owner is required to protect the materials during the investigation period (TRPA 2011).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Natural Setting
Recognizing that the study area has been disturbed by human activity for much of its history, it is unlikely that the
floral and faunal communities seen today are representative of those that were present before extensive EuroAmerican settlement of the area. The introduction of exotic plant and animal species, the alteration of watercourse
channels, and general habitat degradation that have occurred since Euro-American settlement have produced a
landscape and biotic community likely quite different from its earlier state. Many native species still exist in the
area, including some used by the native Washoe people; however, the diversity of plant and animal life in the
marsh and surrounding area has changed, and in some regards has become more limited.
Prehistoric Archaeological Setting
The prehistory of the northern Sierra Nevada has been studied by numerous researchers, among them Ataman
(1999), Heizer and Elsasser (1953), Elsasser (1960, 1978), Elston (1971, 1982, 1986), Elston et al. (1977, 1994,
1995), Miller and Elston (1979), Ingbar (1994), Moratto (1984), Pendleton et al. (1982), Kuffner (1987), Peterson
(1984), Zeier and Elston (1986), Delacorte (1997), McGuire (1997), and Moore and Burke (1992). The cultural
chronology of the region, based on the synthesis provided by Elston et al. (1994:11), is summarized in

Scant archaeological evidence of early occupation has been discovered thus far in the Sierra Nevada; however,
east of the Sierra Nevada crest, in the western Great Basin, the Tahoe Reach Phase is seen by Elston et al. (1994)
as an expression of early occupation. Dating from approximately 10,000 to 8000 years before present (BP),
archaeological sites associated with this period are marked by the presence of Great Basin stemmed points with
ground margins, bifaces, choppers, and crescent-shaped tools. The subsequent Spooner Phase of the Early
Archaic (8000–4000 BP), originally proposed by Elston (1971), currently lacks diagnostic artifacts and remains
generally undefined pending the results of future archaeological research.
Throughout the ensuing Archaic period, populations increased, the resource base broadened, and food gathering
and tools used for processing plant materials became more complex, with new items and technologies added to
existing ones. Flaked stone tools became simpler and smaller, with less stylistic variation, and during the Late
Archaic, the bow and arrow replaced the atlatl and dart (Elston 1982:187; 1986). The intensified use of resources
and the complexity of expanded tool kits are representative of the transition to the Late Archaic archaeological
period. Much of this transition is thought to have been in response to population pressures, possibly spurred by a
hot, dry climatic regime occurring between 1000 and 2000 years BP (Elston 1986).
Elston (1982:189) proposed a basic Archaic settlement pattern for the Great Basin with two variations: a
dispersed and a restricted pattern. The former was the typical pattern in the more arid regions of the western Great
Basin (central Nevada), where small residential groups frequently selected different winter habitations and base
camp sites from year to year to take advantage of a relatively unpredictable and scarce resource base. The
restricted pattern prevailed throughout the northern Sierra Nevada front (the area adjacent to and east of the crest)
between 4000 and 2000 years BP At that time, greater effective moisture provided a resource base that was
relatively more reliable and abundant in relation to population density. In the Middle Archaic, residential groups
regularly occupied sites with access to a suite of subsistence resources. Thus, high-return resources could be
procured more efficiently and at lower cost, with few residential moves (Elston 1982:196; Zeier and Elston 1986).
Moore and Burke (1992:21) define four artifact classes that characterize Middle Archaic period sites: large
corner-notched and contracting-stem points, large bifaces used as scrapers rather than for cutting, flake tools made
on large interior flakes (flakes not exhibiting cortical surfaces) with steep edge angles similar to those of the
bifaces, and expedient gravers and perforators. Reduction of lithic materials was generalized and inefficient,
producing a large amount of waste rock (Moore and Burke 1992:21–24). Elston (1986:141) proposed that Middle
Archaic winter sites were located in optimal ecological locales. In the Truckee Meadows, it appears from the
density of diagnostic artifacts that land use intensified during this period. However, there is no evidence for longterm occupation; base camps appear to have been visited frequently for limited periods.
During the Late Martis Phase of the Middle Archaic (3000–1300 BP), the archaeological assemblages associated
with the disparate Great Basin and California cultural areas were distinct. These differences may reflect a cultural
and physical barrier that persists throughout the Martis Phases of the Middle Archaic (Ataman 1999:10–11) and
may have continued into later times, as suggested by research conducted by Deis (1999), who presents evidence
for a discontinuity in the presence of Great Basin projectile point types along the western slopes of the Sierra
Nevada during the Middle/Late Archaic transition. Abrupt technological, settlement, and subsistence changes are
seen throughout the Tahoe Basin at the beginning of the Late Archaic, and these changes may be associated with
the emergence of the ethnographic Washoe (Zeier and Elston 1986). Small projectile points, indicating a switch
from atlatl and dart to bow and arrow technology, are evident throughout the region. The corresponding Early
Kings Beach Phase (1300–700 BP) is characterized by the appearance of hullers and bedrock mortars, apparently
associated with a northern population expansion and subsequent exploitation of pinyon pines. Fish and small
game also become a major part of the diet. This phase is marked by a switch to a toolstone-efficient technology
centered on the primary use of locally available cherts and sinter. In addition to the major shift to small Rosegate
arrow points, other diagnostic traits include the use of large and small triangular bifaces made exclusively of
chert, well-thinned bifaces with large width-to-thickness ratios. Gravers are absent during this period; retouched
flakes are rare; and perforators, if present, tend to be made of recycled small corner-notched points.

Archaeological and Historical Resources

Elston (1982:199) postulated a more dispersed settlement pattern with less regular occupation of optimal sites in
the Late Archaic (Kings Beach Phase). He linked this shift to a changing subsistence pattern with progressively
greater intensity of exploitation of diverse resources and ecozones. Zeier and Elston (1986:377–379) found that
people continued to occupy the old sites but also began to occupy new sites in less optimal locations. Resources
were being depleted faster at the old sites, necessitating more frequent moves, or demographic packing filled in
the spaces between optimal locations. At the new sites, low-ranked resources were used intensively at higher cost.
These new site locations may reflect exploitation of pinyon, which reached its northernmost expansion between
1200 and 710 BP (Raven 1990:78).
On the eastern Sierra Nevada front, the Late Kings Beach Phase of the Late Archaic (700–150 BP) is marked by
flaked stone assemblages dominated by local cherts, with rare use of basalt and sinter (Elston et al. 1994:18).
Although Elston et al. (1994) ascribe the beginning of this period with the appearance of small side-notched point
types that replace the early corner-notched types, Moore and Burke (1992:23) propose that the corner-notched
varieties persist until circa 500 BP, which is consistent with evidence presented by Clay (1996). Elston et al.
(1994:18) state that the evidence is not compelling. Moore and Burke (1992:37) suggest that the dietary breadth
decreases during this phase, and there appears to be a decrease in sites at upper elevations, with increased
occupation at lower elevations, particularly along terraces of the Truckee River.
Ethnographic Setting
Although recent historic-era accounts of traditional Native American territories do not always reflect prehistoric
patterns of native land use and occupation, the Tahoe Basin is unusual in that ethnographic, linguistic, and
archaeological evidence supports a presence of the Washoe and their ancestors in the region for at least several
thousand years. The following outline of Washoe culture and presence in the area is drawn from the recent work
of Lindström (2004), unless otherwise noted.
The study area is located in the center of Washoe territory, which was used primarily by the Southern Washoe or
Hung a lel ti (d’Azevedo 1956, 1984; Downs 1966; Nevers 1976; Stewart 1938). The rich environment of the
Tahoe Basin afforded the Washoe a degree of isolation and independence from neighboring peoples and may
account for their long tenure in the area (d’Azevedo 1984:466, 471). The Washoe are part of an ancient Hokan­
speaking residual population that was subsequently surrounded by Numic-speaking peoples, such as the Northern
Paiute (Jacobsen 1966).
The ethnographic record suggests that during the warmer months, small groups traveled through high mountain
valleys collecting edible and medicinal roots, seeds, and marsh plants. In the higher elevations, men hunted large
game (mountain sheep, deer) and trapped smaller mammals. Suitable tool stone (such as basalt) was quarried at
various locales along the north side of Lake Tahoe. The lake and its tributaries were an important fishery. The
Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek accommodated numerous established fishing areas where multiple family
groups converged to harvest Lahontan cutthroat trout and whitefish from late spring through fall (Lindström and
Rucks 2002, 2003). Archaeological evidence of these ancient Washoe subsistence activities, including temporary
small hunting camps containing flakes of stone and broken tools, is found along the mountain flanks. In the high
valleys, more permanent base camps have been found along lakes, streams, and springs and are represented by
stone flakes, tools, grinding implements, and house depressions.
By the 1850s, Euro-Americans permanently occupied the Washoe territory and had changed traditional lifeways.
Mining, lumbering, grazing, commercial fishing, tourism, and the growth of settlements disrupted traditional
Native American relationships to the land. As hunting and gathering activities were increasingly restricted over
time, the Washoe were often forced to become dependent on the Euro-American settlers. Because access to lands
in the Tahoe Basin and throughout the Sierra Nevada was limited, Washoe families would return to the lake in the
summers, where they negotiated work and camping privileges with various establishments, creating a postcontact
settlement pattern where conditions were congenial. They were employed as domestic laborers around the resorts

and settlements and as basket weavers, commercial fishermen, and guides for backcountry sportsmen (Scott
1973:20).
Unlike Native Americans in many other regions of California, even into the 20th century, the Washoe were not
completely displaced from their traditional lands. In 1917, the Washoe Tribe began reacquiring a small part of
their traditional lands (Nevers 1976:90–91). The Washoe remain a tribe recognized by the U.S. government and
have maintained an established land base. Its 1,200 tribal members are governed by a tribal council that consists
of members of the Carson, Dresslerville, Woodfords, and Reno-Sparks Indian colonies, as well as members from
nonreservation areas. The contemporary Washoe have developed a comprehensive land use plan (Washoe Tribal
Council 1994) that identifies the goals of reestablishing a presence in the Tahoe region and revitalizing Washoe
heritage and cultural knowledge, including the harvest and care of traditional plant resources and the protection of
traditional properties in the cultural landscape (Rucks 1996:3).
Washoe Place Names
Lake Tahoe was both the spiritual and physical center of the Washoe world. The Washoe lived along its shores,
referring to the lake as Da ow a ga, which means “edge of lake.” The Washoe word Da ow, mispronounced by
Euro-Americans as “Tahoe,” gave rise to the lake’s modern name. Freed (1966) and d’Azevedo (1956) reported
the locations of several Washoe encampments in the Tahoe Basin. It is important to note that the names of these
places are geographic references to camping destinations for multiple family groups and not necessarily the name
of a single camp.
According to d’Azevedo (1956:19), the Washoe referred to the “delta” of the Upper Truckee River and Trout
Creek as mesuk malam, which means “a swamp that is now a meadow.” Trout Creek (ma’t’osawhu wa’t’a) and
the Upper Truckee River (imgi’ wa’t’a, t’sigolhu wa’t’a), drainages that form the Upper Truckee River delta,
were also known as mes a, a term also applied to the entire Lake Valley (d’Azevedo 1956:85), perhaps indicating
the traditional importance of the delta. Two of the most important fisheries and productive wetlands in the
subsistence regimes of the Southern Washoe and their Carson Valley neighbors are located in the study area. The
Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek have been identified as being among the most productive and desirable
Washoe fisheries at Lake Tahoe of the 11 fisheries ranked in testimony gathered for the Washoe Lands Claim
Case (Wright n.d.).
Freed (1966) lists two ethnographic camp sites associated with these fisheries:
►

►

ImgiwO’tha (cutthroat trout + water course) was the name given to a fishing camp “east of the Upper Truckee
River and about one and a half miles from [south] of the lake.”
mathOcahuwO’tha (whitefish + water course) was the name given to “an important fall camp on Trout
Creek” that was noted as a particularly attractive destination in the late fall when families gathered on their
way out of the basin en route to the Pine Nut Mountains or west into the Sierra Nevada foothills for acorns.
This camp was also noted because families could spread out, camping near their fish blinds, which they could
not do at other fisheries. Families drove whitefish into the shallows, scooped them from the water, and dried
and processed them for winter stores. Late berries, another important winter staple, were also gathered at this
location.

In his interviews with the Washoe, d’Azevedo (1956:19–20) was given the same names (recorded in varying
orthography) as designations for the water course (Trout Creek) itself, although he was told that
mathOcahuwO’tha was a recent name for Trout Creek, known formerly as t’sigóhu w’át’a (kidney [shaped] +
water course), according to Roma James (the father of Washoe Elder Steven James, mentioned below) and
George Snooks. d’Azevedo was also given this name for a tributary of Trout Creek located upstream “near Sierra
House” (along Pioneer Trail). In addition, according to d’Azevedo, Meshuk málam (medicine + confluence) was
the name for the delta or wetland where the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek converge into a wetland (the
Upper Truckee Marsh) before entering the lake.

Nevers (1976:6) gives the same names (with varying orthography) and locations of camps for the same areas as
those given by Freed (1966), stating that the Carson Valley and Southern Washoe used the camps at Trout Creek,
“catching plentiful whitefish” and that “at Imigi Watah, the Washoe caught cutthroat trout which were big enough
to pull a man into the water.” In addition, Scott (1957:187) presents pictures of two Washoe women, dating from
October 19, 1901, and taken northeast of the Upper Truckee River, with a portion of the marsh in the background.
The caption identifies the women as being “near their summer campground.”
These camp locales have been confirmed in more recent ethnographic and oral history research. Steven James
relates that his younger brother, Ivan, was born in the camp their family occupied close to Trout Creek, east of
and adjacent to U.S. 50 (d’Azevedo 1956:18). James remembers that the area upstream was important “for many
families” and believes that families would have had particular places along this river that they returned to each
year. His family’s camp (where Ivan was born) was near the present-day highway and located in a stand of
lodgepole pine, “all cut down now.” He recalls that the fishing was good along the river, up past Sierra House all
the way to Star Lake. He also notes that there was an old trail, a shortcut that provided access to Lake Tahoe from
Woodfords and passed by the Sierra House site. This trail was described to d’Azevedo (1956:18) as traversing up
Willow Creek canyon to Sierra House, via Fountain Place, or góbiba’ (and perhaps over Armstrong Pass).
The marsh not only was an important fishing location but provided other significant resources. For example,
Washoe Elder Florine Conway recalls that there was a particular “gray willow” that grew from the trunks of
downed shrubs growing in Trout Creek downstream of U.S. 50. The willows produced desirable long wands
sought by weavers of large, ornate baskets (three rod degiku) (d’Azevedo 1956:18).
Knox Johnson (Johnson, pers. comm. with Susan Lindström, 2004), a descendant of a pioneer family that grazed
cattle along Trout Creek, recalls that the Washoe harvested cutthroat trout in spring, with special emphasis on
whitefish in Trout Creek in fall. He also remembers that Washoe Indians camped along Trout Creek near the U.S.
50 bridge as late as the 1950s while they worked summer jobs at the south end of the lake. Johnson further notes
that the ten-acre parcel of land in the Highland Woods subdivision, north of U.S. 50 and off Sunset Drive, was a
large Washoe Indian camp.
The area that Johnson refers to is likely part of archaeological site CA-ELD-26/H, a large Native American camp
that extends along the bluff overlooking the Upper Truckee River/Trout Creek marsh, north of Springwood Drive
and containing the former Mosher (Barton) cattle corrals and the Barton family ranch house at “Meadowedge.” It
is possible that a substantial portion of the surrounding Highland Woods and Sierra Tract subdivisions
encompasses this large Native American encampment. Both residential subdivisions were likely constructed
where the Washoe fishing camp (known as Imigi Watah) was located, as described in detail by Freed (1966),
d’Azevedo (1956), and Nevers (1976). The developments are also located adjacent to Trout Creek, an important
fall camp that remained a resource and camping area for several families well after contact until increased
development and subdivision after World War II ended these arrangements.
Historic-Era Setting
Historic-era activities in the Tahoe Basin and specifically in and in the vicinity of the study area can be discussed
in terms of several general trends or themes that have most influenced the current patterns of land use and
development: transportation, cattle ranching and agriculture, timber harvesting, and the advent of resort and
residential communities. Unless otherwise noted, the information presented below is drawn from the work of
Lindström (2004).
Transportation
The opening of the Comstock silver mining boom in Nevada, beginning in mid-1859, prompted a surge in heavy
wagon and freight traffic through the Tahoe Basin and the development of roadways and routes that allowed
increased and quicker travel though the region. Lindström and Hall (1998) and Scott (1957, 1973) have described
these various routes in detail. Those most relevant to the study area are discussed below.

Johnson Pass Road
Johnson Pass Road was one of the earliest road components in the Bonanza Road System between Placerville and
the mines of the Comstock Lode. The Bonanza Road System was also known as the Johnson Cut-off, the Lake
Road, the Placerville/Lake Tahoe Road, the Lake Bigler Toll Road, the Lake House Road, the Lincoln Highway,
and, ultimately, U.S. 50 (Scott 1973:59, 64, 451; TRPA 1971:8). The Bonanza Road (more commonly referred to
as the “Old Placerville Road”) traversed the Johnson Cut-off over Echo Summit, down to Lake Valley, and then
to Mormon Station (Genoa). Laid out in 1852 (probably as a narrow trail), it was passable for wagons sometime
before 1854 (Hoover, Rensch, and Rensch 1966:76). The Lake House Road “dogleg” of the Johnson Pass Road
branched northward through the present-day Sierra Tract and Highland Woods subdivisions.
The present-day Pioneer Trail, previously referred to as the “back road,” was often preferred by freighting teams
because it was less sandy than the Lake House Road (Scott 1957:380). Knox Johnson notes that the “Old” Lake
House Road was really two roads that joined into a single route through the present-day Sierra Tract subdivision.
One road branched from Pioneer Trail near the present fire station, and the other road left Pioneer Trail along
Trout Creek, about two miles northeast of Meyers. The two roads merged into one due south of the Sierra Tract
subdivision and passed through the subdivision near Carson Street, exiting to cross U.S. 50 at its intersection with
O’Malley Drive at the present-day 7-Eleven convenience store.
The “Old” Lake House Road continued north of U.S. 50 through the current Highland Woods subdivision, exiting
off Rubicon Trail. From there, the road crossed the marsh on an elevated causeway and entered the Al Tahoe
subdivision along Argonaut Avenue. At Lily Street, the road turned east and followed Lakeview Avenue to El
Dorado Beach, where it again joined the modern route of U.S. 50. This lakeshore “dogleg” is shown as a major
route through Lake Valley on maps dating between 1861 and 1949. The modern route of U.S. 50, which bisects
the Sierra Tract subdivision, did not assume prominence in the Lake Valley transportation system until 1949.
Portions of present-day U.S. 50 and Pioneer Trail were also part of the first designated coast-to-coast motor route
referred to as the Lincoln Highway. The highway, consisting of a route patched together from preexisting roads and
newly built “seedling miles” intended to spur economic growth, started in Times Square, New York City, and ended
in Jack London Square in Oakland, California. At the time, the federal government was not involved with the
designation and construction of the route. The people primarily responsible for establishing the Lincoln Highway
Association in 1913 and conducting all its activities were Henry Joy, president of the Packard Motor Car Company,
and Carl Fisher, owner of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Mr. Joy and Mr. Fisher, along with other automobile
manufacturers and industrialists of the day, had a vested interest in the growth and improvement of roadways in the
United States. A better and more extensive road network would lead to increased sales.
In 1921, the federal government passed the Federal Highway Act, which provided $75 million of matching funds to
the states for highway construction. However, the act required each state to identify seven percent of its total
mileage as “primary”; only these roads would be eligible for federal funds. The Lincoln Highway, already an
established and maintained route, was ready for designation as a primary road worthy of federal funding. By the
late 1920s, the Lincoln Highway in California was no longer a private enterprise and had been fully absorbed into
the federal highway system.
Lake House
Lake Bigler House (referred to as “Lake House”) was constructed by Seneca Dean, William W. Lapham, and
Robert Garwood Dean on 320 acres they acquired in 1859. It was constructed on a dogleg of Johnson Pass Road
that formerly fronted Lake Tahoe one-half mile northeast of the location where the Upper Truckee River empties
into the lake. Lake House, Tahoe’s first lakeshore hotel (Hoover et al. 1966:84), was erected near what are now
Lakeview and Lily Avenues. It was known variously as Lake Bigler House, Lake House, Van Wagener’s Hotel,
and Dean and Martin’s Station, until Thomas B. Rowland established the name Rowland’s Lake House and

Station. Discovery of the Comstock Lode in 1859 and attendant construction of a series of toll roads through
Tahoe’s Lake Valley into the Carson Valley brought throngs of travelers past these doors.
Cattle Ranching and Agriculture
Ranching and farming endeavors that raised beef and dairy cattle and hay and grain in the meadows within and in
the vicinity of the marsh were established beginning in the 1860s. Several pioneer ranching and dairy families in
the Tahoe region, including the Barton and Johnson families, had land holdings on or near the lower reaches of
the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek drainages adjacent to the study area. In some cases, family ownership
dates back to homesteads acquired in the 1860s; for most, however, lands were purchased as cut-over timber
holdings in the early 1900s.
Barton Ranch
Barton Ranch was situated in the first meadow north of Yank’s Station (Meyers). Homesteaded by cattleman
Hiram Barton, who came to California in the 1850s, it served as his Lake Valley “home ranch” during the summer
season. Although it supplied feed for the freighting teams and dairy products to the traveler, the holding was not
strictly considered a way station in the 1860s. It also served as a lodging house when other establishments on the
lakeshore leg of the Johnson Cut-off were filled to capacity. The bottomlands south of the Upper Truckee River’s
outlet passed through the ranch and milk house, which later would be known as “Meadowedge.” The ranch house
was located east of the study area and beyond Rubicon Trail. Barton was the father of two girls and seven boys.
One of his sons, William D. Barton, was still active in the cattle business in 1955, with his headquarters in the
Tahoe Valley (Scott 1957:379).
The ranching industry was seasonal, and Lake Valley (located just south of the study area) was typically used as
summer range for livestock. Prior conversations with Barton relatives and friends, such as the Moshers, and the
oral history recollections of Alva Barton provide general insights into the migratory dairy and beef enterprise
ranching system practiced at Lake Tahoe (see Lindström and Rucks [2002] for additional details). Alva Barton
pointed out that although the meadows were located in the mountains, they still needed to be irrigated during the
dry season. They were irrigated using a network of water impounding and diverting dams and wing walls, water
gates, and miscellaneous earthen water works. Some of these features have been recorded by Lindström (1995,
1996) and Lindström and Rucks (2002, 2003) along the Upper Truckee River within the study area and by
Lindström and Hall (1998) along Trout Creek. To enhance pasture production, stock was periodically moved.
More recently, the Moshers’ grazing practices were modified by local regulations until grazing on the property
was finally discontinued.
Johnson Ranch
Johnson family members were pioneers in the Lake Valley area and introduced irrigation practices to neighboring
ranchers. Chris Johnson owned considerable land holdings in the vicinity of the study area. Although most of the
Johnsons’ holdings were centered around Bijou Meadows, the Johnsons also irrigated Trout Creek Meadows. In
the early 1900s, in search of additional pastureland, Chris Johnson purchased acreage along the middle reach of
Trout Creek in the eastern portion of the present-day Sierra Tract. To purchase the land, he paid $13,000 to the
Jacques estate, a firm from Los Angeles that had been involved in developing the Al Tahoe subdivision.
According to Knox Johnson, grandson of Chris Johnson, the family stored water behind two dams on Trout Creek
(Lindström, pers. comm., 1996, cited in Lindström and Hall 1998). The upper dam was located at the site of a
present-day South Lake Tahoe Public Utility District facility and the lower dam was opposite Knox Johnson’s
former residence in the Sierra Tract at 1057 Blue Lake Road. Levees were built along both sides of Trout Creek to
back up water and flood the meadow, and the family ice house was once located at the present-day muffler shop
at 2774 Lake Tahoe Boulevard.

Timber Harvesting
A general history of Comstock-era logging in the Tahoe Basin, with additional information on lumbering in the
Lake Valley area, is offered by Lindström and Hall (1998), Myrick (1992), and Scott (1957, 1973).
Several major lumber companies formerly operated in the Tahoe Basin. Each developed an impressive network of
sawmills, railroads, tramways, flumes, and rafting operations that was designed to cut and move most of the
lumber over the crest of the Carson Range and down to the Comstock mines. The Carson & Tahoe Lumber &
Fluming Company (CTLFC) emerged as the chief operator, with holdings in the east-central, south, and
southwestern portions of the Tahoe Basin. The company was formed by Bliss and Yerington in 1873, with
headquarters at Glenbrook, Nevada.
One of the CTLFC’s lumbering operations was centered near present-day Bijou at Taylor’s Landing. In 1889,
two years after the CTLFC installed its Lake Valley Railroad, it drove double rows of pilings to hold back the
sand at the influx of the Upper Truckee River. Pilings were also driven at strategic points along the river, serving
as “bumpers” to ease the passage of logs (site CA-ELD-739-H) (Lindström 2004). Logs were floated downstream
at high water, and the timber was banked at the outlet. The “go-devil” barge became a familiar sight in the
shallow water at the mouth of the river, where it was used to retrieve sunken logs. After the sunken logs were
winched to the surface, they were moved to the Glenbrook Mill (Scott 1957:209).
During the 1890s, the CTLFC obtained timber rights to more than 6,000 acres along the south shore of the lake,
acquiring rights on Barton family holdings, among others. As the timber business prospered, thousands of men
found work as lumberjacks, log rollers, and cordwood splitters. Ranchers and dairymen who provisioned the
lumber operations also benefited. Although the larger suppliers of hay and grain were Carson Valley ranchers,
supplementary amounts of feed were provided by ranchers and dairymen, such as the Bartons (Lindström and
Hall 1998:22).
By the mid-1890s, the South Lake Tahoe area had been stripped of its marketable timber, and large-scale logging
in this region ceased.
Resort and Residential Community Development
With the demise of logging, title to land sections in and surrounding the study area could be obtained by paying
the back taxes for the property or, at the most, $1.50 an acre. This incentive led to an era of resort and summerhome development that came to characterize much of South Lake Tahoe (Scott 1957:219). Lindström and Hall
(1998) have summarized these events that occurred in the vicinity of the study area.
As the Tahoe Basin attracted more tourists, diverse resorts appeared along the shores of the lake. Growing
numbers of eastern visitors joined the members of San Francisco’s elite and the wealthy mining and business
interests of the Comstock Lode at the lake’s best hotels. People of more modest means vacationed in rustic hotels
and cottages or camped at resort facilities such as Lakeside. The movement toward year-round use of the Tahoe
Basin brought building and development to Tahoe’s shores, with the need to house employees in addition to the
vacationers. Lake Tahoe’s south shore was heavily involved with this growth.
By 1908, Chris Johnson owned land along Trout Creek, including a triangular piece of property in the current
Sierra Tract subdivision located adjacent to and south of the study area. During the late 1940s, the Johnsons
subdivided their parcel, which was bounded on the north by U.S. 50, on the west by O’Malley Drive, and on the
east by Trout Creek Marsh, calling it “Johnson Acres No. 2.” As part of “Johnson Acres No. 1,” they also
subdivided property near “the big Indian camp” at Bijou into one-acre lots that sold for $1,100–1,600 each. In
1951 Knox Johnson built his “cabin” at 1057 Blue Lake Road. At this time, there was only one street in the
subdivision. Development on the remaining property west of O’Malley Drive, known then as the Tahoe Sierra
Subdivision No. 1, No. 3, and No. 4 (and currently known as the Sierra Tract Subdivision), began circa 1945–
1946.

The Highland Woods subdivision is located at the southern extent of the Upper Truckee River Marsh, adjacent to
and immediately north of U.S. 50. Before it was developed, the land was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest
Service (USFS). The earliest part of this subdivision was developed in 1959 as the “Country Crossroads Village.”
The ten-acre lot located off Sunset Drive, at the western end of the subdivision, was once a sawmill site that was
operated during the 1940s by Gus Winkleman, a former supervisor for El Dorado County.
Previous Cultural Resources Investigations
Twenty-seven known cultural resources investigations have been conducted within one-quarter mile of the project
area. Of these, nine are in or adjacent to the study area (Table 3.3-2). Many of these investigations have been
conducted in relation to erosion control and wetland restoration projects proposed for locations within the study
area or on adjacent parcels. Not all of these investigations included intensive field surveys, archival research, oral
histories, and consultation with the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California. An appendix prepared for this
EIR/EIS/EIS contains information on the nature and location of cultural resources. In accordance with Section 9
of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (16 United States Code [USC] 470hh) and Section 304 of
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 USC 470w-3), this information is privileged and is intended
for limited distribution only. Thus, that appendix is referred to in this section of the EIR/EIS/EIS as “Confidential
Appendix.”

These previously identified resources reflect the prehistoric and ethnographic occupation of the area by Native
American peoples and the predominant themes of historic-era activity that occurred throughout much of the
Tahoe Basin. The prehistoric resources, particularly the site of CA-ELD-26/H, represent the intensive use of the
lakeshore and the adjacent Upper Truckee River Marsh by the Washoe for fishing, the acquisition of other
numerous lake and marsh resources, and general habitation. Subsurface testing in 2012 by AECOM
archaeologists at CA-ELD-26/H has identified buried prehistoric cultural deposits that appear relatively
substantial and intact, suggesting that the site has good physical integrity. In addition, the location of CA-ELD­
26/H appears to be consistent with the Washoe fishing camp Imgiw O’tha, and ethnographic accounts indicate
that the site was used into the 1940s and 1950s. Ethnographic and locational information demonstrates that
CA-ELD-26/H was especially important to the Washoe as a village, meeting place, and/or ceremonial site or
important in some other capacity and is therefore recommended eligible under NRHP Criterion a and CRHR
Criterion 1. The site does not appear to be directly associated with a significant person or persons (NRHP
Criterion b, CRHR Criterion 2), nor is it distinctive or the work of a master (NRHP Criterion c, CRHR Criterion
3). Although a portion of the site has been affected by development, the portion in the project area appears to
possess good to excellent integrity, indicating that the site retains important scientific information. Therefore, the
prehistoric component of CA-ELD-26/H is recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP and CRHR under
Criterion d and 4 (data potential), respectively.

Locus C of CA-ELD-26/H appears to be the remains of a short-term flaking event. Because of a lack of data
potential, including sufficient quantities of obsidian that may be used for relative dating, and subsurface deposits,
Locus C does not appear to contribute to the NRHP eligibility of CA-ELD-26/H under Criteria a and 1.
Because the historic refuse associated with CA-ELD-26/H cannot be associated with a particular activity, event,
or theme, these remains are not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or CRHR.
The single isolated prehistoric artifact (site UTR-IF-1) does not retain any significant data and thus is not eligible
for listing in the NRHP and CRHR.
The activities of the early lumber industry are visible in the study area, including the pilings and structural
remains in the channel of the Upper Truckee River and on the shore of Lake Tahoe (CA-ELD-739H and
CA-ELD-739H Locus 1). These items have been attributed to the CTLFC and appear to be portions of the system
used to transport sawed logs from the timber stands to the company’s mills for processing. The bumper pilings,
situated at a sharp bend in the river channel, were documented by Lindström in 1996 but only the top portions that
were not submerged could be observed by AECOM archaeologists from a distance in 2007. The level of the river
may have been higher at the time of the 2007 survey than it was in 1996. It is also possible that a collapse of the
riverbank, which consists primarily of soft sediments, has obscured this site. The pilings on the shore of the lake
at the mouth of the Upper Truckee River were documented by Herschel Davis of the USFS, Lake Tahoe Basin
Management Unit, in 1990.
When the pilings on the shore of the lake were first recorded, the lake level was considerably lower at that time
than it was in 2007 (California Department of Parks and Recreation Archaeological Site Record—CA-ELD-739H
[Confidential Appendix]) when the EDAW (now AECOM) archaeologists conducted their investigations. As a
result, only the very top portions of several of the pilings could be seen in 2007, and these were located
approximately 100 feet from the present-day shoreline. Due to lack of accessibility no evaluations of the
eligibility of either portion of CA-ELD-739H were made at the time of their recording.
Documented sections of the Old Placerville Road (CA-ELD-721H), the “Old” Lake House Road (CA-ELD­
2223H), and a portion of an unnamed unpaved roadway (CA-ELD-2240H) all demonstrate the degree to which
the area has been influenced by early transportation systems. Although the Upper Truckee River Marsh may not
have necessarily been a destination on these roads, the gentle nature of the topography within and in the vicinity
of the marsh made it a perfect location for the surveying and constructing early roads. The immediate
surroundings of some of these roads have changed little since the roads were originally laid out during the
Comstock mining era, but they are little more than wide footpaths now and represent only small portions of the
original system. Consequently, none of them have been recommended eligible for listing on the NRHP and
CRHR.
The Dunlap dam (CA-ELD-2235/H) is associated with a common historic-era development theme in the Tahoe
Basin and is not directly associated with particularly important events in relation to these developments (NRHP
Criterion a, CRHR Criterion 1). Although the dam and associated ditches may be associated with specific notable
area individuals (Barton and Johnson families) (NRHP Criterion b, CRHR Criterion 2), the features no longer
retain the integrity that sufficiently expresses their use and period of significance. They are also commonly
encountered features, do not exhibit distinctive characteristics or high artistic values, and are not known to be the
works of a recognized master (NRHP Criterion c, CRHR Criterion 3). Lastly, the data potential of these irrigation
features (NRHP Criterion d, CRHR Criterion 4) has been fully realized through their documentation; no further
important scientific data are likely to be present. Regarding the prehistoric component, the seven obsidian flakes
appear to reflect a one-time event associated with tool production/retooling, and lack further data that would
contribute to regional research issues. Therefore, the prehistoric component does not appear to be eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP or CRHR under Criterion d or 4. Consequently, CA-ELD-2235/H is recommended not
eligible for NRHP or CRHR listing.

Cultural resources such as a sparse scatter of 19th- and 20th-century debris (CA-ELD-2238H) and the fence lines
(CA-ELD-2239H) are related to ranching, grazing, and general historic-era use of the marsh and the lakeshore.
However, these are common historic-era development themes in the Tahoe Basin, and neither of these resources is
directly associated with particularly important events in relation to these developments (NRHP Criterion a, CRHR
Criterion 1). Although features may be associated with specific notable area individuals (Barton and Johnson
families) (NRHP Criterion b, CRHR Criterion 2), they no longer retain the integrity that sufficiently expresses
their period of significance. They are also commonly encountered features, do not exhibit distinctive
characteristics or high artistic values, and are not known to be the works of a recognized master (NRHP Criterion

through their documentation; no further important scientific data are likely to be present. Consequently, CA-ELD­
2238H and CA-ELD-2239H are recommended not eligible for NRHP or CRHR listing.
2007 AND 2012 SURVEY RESULTS OF DOCUMENTED CULTURAL RESOURCES
In October and November 2007, EDAW (now AECOM) archaeologists conducted an intensive survey of portions
of the study area that had not been covered under previous surveys or were subjected to only reconnaissance-level
inventories (Exhibit 3.3-1). As a result of the EDAW (now AECOM) 2007 survey, six previously undocumented
historic-era resources were recorded (Table 3.3-4). An additional inventory was conducted by AECOM
archaeologists in June 2012. No additional previously undocumented cultural resources were recorded during this
effort. However, new data were added to the descriptions of sites CA-ELD-26/H and CA-ELD-2235/H
(Confidential Appendix).

Of the six newly recorded sites and features, two appeared related to cattle ranching that occurred in the study
area from the middle decades of the 19th century until recent years. Most consisted of isolated features or
artifacts, although a “site,” a cattle corral and nearby structural remains, was also documented (Confidential
Appendix).
UTRM-1
This site consists of a livestock corral identified by Susan Lindström as having been associated with the
operations of the Mosher family, who were relatives of the Bartons. Other possible structural remains, including
20th-century poured-concrete footings, were noted adjacent to the corral. The corral features several hinged gates,
a truck or wagon ramp for loading or unloading livestock for transportation, and interior fences dividing the main
corral into several sections. In general, the entire structure remains in good condition. It appears to have been

altered or repaired in recent years, as evidenced by the placement of several plywood segments or patches that
exhibit minimally weathered surfaces. Some segments of the corral fencing, both exterior walls and interior
dividers, have partially collapsed in place but have not been dismantled to any great extent. The corral appears to
show several stages of construction using expedient materials over a long period. Railroad ties (some even
retaining the tie plates and spikes), sawed logs, heavy tree branches or trunks, milled dimensional lumber, and
plywood have all been incorporated into the corral. Iron hardware ranges from machine-produced and
commercially available hinges, spikes, and wire nails to latches and square-cut nails that may date to as early as
the later years of the 19th century. However, given the expedient and opportunistic nature of much of the corral, it
is not possible to determine whether the hardware was installed strictly for corral use or whether it was simply
attached to reused posts, boards, and other elements of the structure.
Other possible structural remains were noted adjacent to and within approximately 100 feet west of the corral.
These remains consist of what may be a recently capped drilled well, two poured concrete blocks or footings, and
a general scatter of mid-20th- to late 20th-century refuse. This area is wooded, and the footings and debris appear
to be randomly scattered among the trees, all of which appear to be at least 40–50 years old. On the South Lake
Tahoe U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle map (photorevised in 1992), two possible buildings are
shown in this general location. No other structural remains are present in the area of the corral, and it is assumed
that one of the depicted buildings or structures is the Mosher corral.
Although the corral is associated with a notable Tahoe-area ranching family, it has clearly been altered numerous
times since its original date of construction. Given the consistent incorporation of reused and expedient materials
into the corral, it would be difficult to date specific portions of the structure based on materials and construction
methods. In addition, although the corral was built according to functional needs unique to the ranching business,
it was not the work of a master (per NRHP and CRHR criteria), nor does it appear to be a particularly early
example or a unique structure. Consequently, because of a lack of integrity and significant historical association,
this resource is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP and CRHR.
UTRM-2
This isolated resource consists of the remains of a farm or ranch wagon possibly dating to as early as the late 19th
century. All that remains is the frame, portions of the bed, the front end, side braces, and a portion of the tongue.
Although heavily weathered, the wood and iron parts remain in good condition and reflect an early period of
construction with the subsequent addition of later hardware. A mix of machine-produced, commercially cast, and
hand-forged hardware demonstrates that the wagon was probably used over a long period of time, from a time
when hinges, straps, spikes, and brackets were entirely or partially forged by a blacksmith to when such elements
were almost exclusively produced in a commercial factory setting.
It is not possible to determine exactly who used this wagon and for what specific purposes. Given its robust
construction, it does not appear to have been intended primarily as a vehicle for transporting people. More likely,
it was intended to haul material, such as the equipment, supplies, and feed necessary for the daily operation of a
ranching enterprise. Given the present location of the wagon, it likely was owned and used by the Barton or
Mosher operations.
The wagon is an interesting artifact from a time when ranching was one of the predominant commercial activities
in the South Lake Tahoe region, and it may be associated with notable area families; however, it cannot be linked
with any specific important historical event or person(s). In addition, much of the original structure of the wagon
including the wheels and tires, axles, superstructure, seat, and tongue, are missing. Although what remains is in
fairly good condition, much of its structural integrity has been compromised. Consequently, this isolated artifact
is recommended not eligible for NRHP/CRHR listing.

UTRM-3 and UTRM-4
These two isolated artifacts consist of 1-inch steel logging cables, or “chokers,” most likely used during
commercial logging operations within and near the study area. The location of UTRM-3 also includes a sparse
scatter of probably related debris, such as the remains of a rubber (not steel-belted) truck tire, and a section of
galvanized steel box beam that may have served as a truck bumper. None of these isolated items appears to date to
before the 1950s or 1960s. They may be related to expedient lumbering and/or hazardous tree removal that may
have been conducted in relation to the construction of nearby houses. Because of their recent vintage and lack of
historical association, neither of these artifacts is recommended eligible for NRHP or CRHR listing.
UTRM-5
Situated on the west bank of the Upper Truckee River, this feature consists of a boulder pile partially buried in the
bank and extending partially into the river channel. The water-worn boulders incorporated into this pile range
from approximately 12 inches to more than 18 inches in diameter and appear to have been purposefully deposited
at this location. No other similar deposits were noted along the river channel, and such boulders do not appear to
occur naturally within the study area. No other structures, buildings, or other signs of construction are present in
the area. Although these boulders are clearly not a natural feature, it is not known why they were placed in this
spot. They may represent a localized attempt at riverbank stabilization or the beginnings of a dam or channel
diversion project intended to store or reroute water in relation to cattle ranching. Regardless, this feature does not
appear to be associated with any significant event, and it clearly does not represent the work of a master or a
unique structure. Consequently, it is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP and CRHR.
UTRM-6
This isolated artifact consists of a small midsection of an obsidian projectile point. It is not possible to determine a
specific projectile point style, although the thin blade and the approximate angle of the edges suggest that it may
be an arrow point characteristic of the later prehistoric or early ethnographic periods. Because this artifact is
isolated, is not associated with any significant event, and cannot provide further scientific data, it is recommended
not eligible for NRHP and CRHR listing.
Paleontological Setting
The study area is located within Holocene-age (11,000 years BP and younger) alluvial fill and Holocene flood
plain deposits (Saucedo 2005). To be considered a fossil, an object must be more than 11,000 years old.
Therefore, no fossils exist within the study area.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES AND MITIGATION MEASURES

SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA
For this analysis, significance criteria are based on the checklist presented in Appendix G of the State CEQA
Guidelines; the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist; factual or scientific information and data; and regulatory
standards of federal, state, and local agencies. These criteria also encompass the factors taken into account under
NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and intensity of its effects. The CEQA,
NEPA, and TRPA criteria are listed below.
CEQA Criteria
Under CEQA, an alternative was determined to result in a significant effect related to archaeological and
historical resources if it would:

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX

3.3-18

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

►

cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource as defined in Section 15064.5 of
the State CEQA Guidelines (CEQA 1);

►

cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of an archaeological resource pursuant to Section
15064.5 of the State CEQA Guidelines (CEQA 2); or

►

disturb any human remains, including those interred outside of formal cemeteries (CEQA 3).

Section 15064.5 generally defines historical resources as (1) a resource listed in, or determined to be eligible by
the State Historical Resources Commission, for listing in the CRHR; (2) a resource included in a local register of
historical resources or identified as significant in a historical resource survey; and (3) any other object, building,
structure, site, area, place, record, or manuscript that a lead agency determines to be historically significant,
provided that the lead agency’s determination is supported by substantial evidence. A substantial adverse change
in the significance of a historical resource means physical demolition, destruction, relocation, or alteration of the
resource or its immediate surroundings such that the historical resource would be materially impaired.
A cultural resource may be eligible for listing in the CRHR if it:
►

is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of California’s history
and cultural heritage;

►

is associated with the lives of persons important in our past;

►

embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or method of construction or represents the
work of an important creative individual or possesses high artistic values; or

►

has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.

Section 15064.5 generally defines a significant archaeological site as one that is a historical resource or one that
meets the definition of a unique archaeological resource in Section 21083.2 of the California Public Resources
Code.
NEPA Criteria
Under the National Historic Preservation Act and the regulations in 36 CFR Part 800, the criteria for assessing
adverse effects on cultural resources is guided by the specific legal context of the site’s significance as set out in
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (16 USC 470), as amended. A property may be listed in the
NRHP if it meets criteria for evaluation defined in 36 CFR 60.4:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archaeology, engineering and
culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association and:
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess a artistic value, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Archaeological and Historical Resources

Most prehistoric archaeological sites are evaluated with regard to Criterion (d) of the NRHP, which refers to site
data potential. Such sites typically lack historical documentation that might otherwise adequately describe their
important characteristics. Archaeological methods and techniques are applied to gain an understanding of the
types of information that may be recovered from deposits at the site. Data sought are those recognized to be
applicable to scientific research questions or to other cultural values. For example, shellfish remains from an
archaeological deposit can provide information about the nature of prehistoric peoples’ diet, foraging range,
exploited environments, environmental conditions, and seasons during which various shellfish species were taken.
These are data of importance to scientific research that can lead to the reconstruction of prehistoric lifeways.
Some archaeological sites may be of traditional or spiritual significance to contemporary Native Americans or
other groups, particularly those sites that are known to contain human burials.
Site integrity is also a consideration for the NRHP eligibility of an archaeological locale. The aspects of
prehistoric resources for which integrity is generally assessed are location, setting design, workmanship, feeling,
and association. These may be compromised to some extent by cultural and postdepositional factors (e.g.,
highway construction, erosion, bioturbation), yet the resource may still retain its integrity for satisfying Criterion
(d) if the important information residing in the site survives. Conversely, archaeological materials such as shells
may not be present in sufficient quantity or may not have adequate preservation for accurate identification. Thus,
their potential as data to address important research questions is significantly reduced. Assessment of these
qualities is particularly important for archaeological properties where the spatial relationships of artifacts and
features are necessary to determine the patterns of past human behavior.
An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the
environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the proposed action. Under NEPA, the significance
of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account
under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are
encompassed by the CEQA criteria used for this analysis.
TRPA Criteria
Based on TRPA’s Initial Environmental Checklist, an alternative would result in a significant impact on
archeological or historical resources if it would:
►

result in an alteration of or adverse physical or aesthetic effect to a significant archaeological or historical site,
structure, object, or building (TRPA 1);

►

have the potential to cause a physical change that would affect unique ethnic cultural values (TRPA 2); or

►

restrict historic or prehistoric religious or sacred uses within the potential impact area (TRPA 3).

The TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist also includes criteria that identify the potential for significant impacts
if a project is located on a property with known cultural, historical, and/or archaeological resources, or associated
with any historically significant events and/or sites or persons. In this EIR/EIS/EIS, these criteria were considered
to be included in the other TRPA criteria listed above.

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
Impacts on archaeological and historical resources that would result from the project were identified by
considering how implementation of the project alternatives would affect the integrity of cultural resources and
human remains identified within or immediately adjacent to the study area. Evaluation of potential impacts on
archaeological and historical resources was based on a review of archaeological reports, historic maps, and other
documents relevant to the study area, and consultation with the Native American community. This evaluation also
included an intensive field inventory with limited testing of portions of the study area not previously subjected to
archaeological surveys.

EFFECTS NOT DISCUSSED FURTHER IN THIS EIR/EIS/EIS
Restrict religious or sacred uses within the potential impact area (TRPA 3)—The proposed alternatives
would not physically restrict religious or sacred uses in the study area, nor would the alternatives change future
management of the study area. Consequently, there would be no impacts to religious or sacred uses.

IMPACT ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
Alternative 1: Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
IMPACT
3.3-1
(Alt. 1)

Damage to or Destruction of Documented Potentially Significant Cultural Resources during
Construction. (CEQA 1, 2; TRPA 1, 2) One potentially significant cultural resource (CA-ELD-26/H) has been
identified within the study area and could be adversely affected during construction. However, as described in
Environmental Commitment 2, the Conservancy would prepare a cultural resources protection plan that would
include oversight of grading in areas that could have the potential to find significant resources in the vicinity of
CA-ELD-26/H. Additionally, project construction personnel would be trained on the possibility of encountering
potentially significant resources; if such resources were encountered, proper measures would be taken to
protect them. Furthermore, final design of the bike path will completely avoid the CA-ELD-26/H site and the
adjacent areas. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

A total of 16 prehistoric and historic-era sites, features, and artifacts have been identified within the study area.
Of these, only one prehistoric site, CA-ELD-26/H, is recommended as significant under CEQA, NEPA, and
TRPA criteria. Site CA-ELD-26/H is recommended as eligible for listing in the NRHP and CRHR because of its
importance to the Washoe people as a fishing camp and for its data potential; future research could provide
information important to researching issues related to prehistoric and ethnographic Washoe occupation of the
Tahoe Basin. Under Alternative 1, several proposed bike paths and viewpoints, as well as staging areas and haul
roads, have the potential to affect portions of the landform in the vicinity of the Highland Woods subdivision,
where materials associated with site CA-ELD-26/H have been documented. As evidenced by archaeological and
ethnographic information, the edge of this landform (a low bluff situated above the marsh) would have been an
important habitation and activity locale for the Washoe during prehistoric periods and into the historic era.
Proposed staging areas and haul roads in the vicinity of the Rubicon Trail access points (to the study area) have
the potential to uncover in-situ artifacts and features directly related to site CA-ELD-26/H.
As described in Environmental Commitment (EC) 2, “Prepare and Implement a Cultural Resources Protection
Plan” (Table 2-6), the Conservancy would install construction barriers around site CA-ELD-26/H, educate
construction workers about site protection requirements, and ensure that a qualified cultural resource specialist
would oversee initial grading activities within the vicinity of the bluff. The purpose of monitoring would be to
ensure that cultural resources potentially uncovered during ground-disturbing activities are identified, evaluated
for significance, and treated in accordance with their possible NRHP and CRHR status. Furthermore, because the
proposed bike path loop on the bluff cannot be redesigned around the CA-Eld-26/H site, the facility will be
removed from the final design. To avoid further disturbance of this area, no user-created trails would be removed
from the area. The bike path, on the far end of the bluff, crossing Trout Creek to the Al Tahoe neighborhood
would remain in the proposed project. The Conservancy, through the cultural resources protection plan, would
ensure that a cultural resource specialist would oversee initial grading to make certain that any cultural resource
discovered are identified, evaluated for significance, and treated in accordance with their possible NRHP and
CRHR status.
Potential treatment methods for significant and potentially significant resources may include but would not be
limited to taking no action (i.e., resources determined not to be significant), avoiding the resource by changing
construction methods or project design, and implementing a program of testing and data recovery, in accordance
with all applicable federal and state requirements. With implementation of EC 2, this impact would be less than
significant.

IMPACT
3.3-2
(Alt. 1)

Damage to or Destruction of Undocumented Potentially Significant Cultural Resources during
Construction. (CEQA 1, 2; TRPA 1, 2) Although the study area has been surveyed for cultural resources,
significant buried archaeological materials may be present that could be adversely affected by project grading
and excavation. However, as described in Environmental Commitment 2, the Conservancy would prepare a
cultural resources protection plan that would include oversight of grading in known resource areas and training
of project construction personnel on the possibility of encountering significant resources; if such resources
were encountered, proper measures would be taken to protect them. This impact would be less than
significant.

The potential exists for previously unidentified prehistoric and historic-era archaeological sites, features, and
artifacts within the study area to be uncovered prior to or during construction-related ground-disturbing activities.
Although the study area has been intensively surveyed for surface and near-surface traces of early Native
American and historic-era activities and remains, if such traces are present below ground but obscured, they
would not have been documented with the surface inventories performed within the study area. Because such
resources could be uncovered during project implementation (e.g., construction of new river channels,
recreational facilities, and paths) and could be determined to represent significant cultural resources in accordance
with CEQA, NEPA, and TRPA criteria.
As described in EC 2 (Table 2-6), the Conservancy would prepare and implement a cultural resources protection
plan. The plan would include training project construction personnel on the possibility of encountering significant
resources; if such resources were encountered, proper measures would be taken to protect those resources until
further determination could be made. The Conservancy would retain a qualified cultural resources specialist to
educate personnel on how to identify prehistoric and historic-era archaeological remains. If unusual amounts of
stone, bone, or shell or significant quantities of historic-era artifacts such as glass, ceramic, metal, or building
remains were to be uncovered during construction activities, work in the vicinity of the specific construction site
at which the suspected resources were uncovered would be suspended, and the Conservancy would be contacted
immediately. The education of construction personnel on the character of potential cultural resources discoveries
increases the likelihood that if potentially significant sites, features, or artifacts were to be encountered, they
would be identified early in construction activities. As described by Impact 3.3-1 (Alt. 1), the Conservancy would
also hire a qualified cultural resource specialist to oversee initial grading and construction activities in the vicinity
of CA-ELD-26/H, where proposed grading has the potential to uncover in-situ artifacts and features directly
related to site CA-ELD-26/H or other general prehistoric and ethnographic occupations of the bluff. Oversight,
training, and early discovery would result in their documentation and preservation, and impacts on them would be
reduced or avoided. Consequently, this impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.3-3
(Alt. 1)

Damage to or Destruction of Previously Undocumented Human Remains during Construction.
(CEQA 3) Project-related construction activities could uncover or otherwise disturb previously undiscovered
prehistoric or historic-era human remains. However, as described in Environmental Commitment 3, the
Conservancy and its contractor would stop work and inform the El Dorado County Coroner of the discovery of
human remains if uncovered during project construction. This impact would be less than significant.

Although no human remains have been listed or recorded within or in the immediate vicinity of the study area,
previously undiscovered human remains could be uncovered by project construction activities. However, as
described in EC 3, “Stop Work Within an Appropriate Radius Around the Discovered Human Remains, Notify
the El Dorado County Coroner and the Most Likely Descendants, and Treat Remains in Accordance With State
and Federal Law” (Table 2-6), the Conservancy would inform the El Dorado County Coroner of the discovery of
human remains if uncovered during project construction. If Native American remains were to be discovered, they
would be protected until consultation with the MLD has taken place and recommendations made. Adherence to
Section 7050.5(b) of the Health and Safety Code and Section 5097.9 would result in treatment and disposition of
human remains in accordance with state law and/or the wishes of the MLD in the case of the discovery of Native
American human remains. Consequently, this impact would be less than significant.

IMPACT
3.3-4
(Alt. 1)

Damage to or Destruction of Documented Potentially Significant Cultural Resources Resulting from
Public Access Features. (CEQA 1, 2; TRPA 1, 2) The proposed bicycle path loop would be located close to
CA-ELD-26/H. However, due to the fact the bike path loop could not be redesigned to avoid the CA-ELD-26/H
site the path will be removed from the final design. The bike path from the Rubicon trail access point to the Al
Tahoe neighborhood would remain due to the fact it is not in the vicinity of the CA-ELD-26/H site. However,
with the implementation of Environmental Commitment 2, the Conservancy would prepare a cultural resources
protection plan that would include assurances that final design placement and orientation of recreation facilities
would incorporate features to minimize visibility and access that could otherwise lead to damage or destruction
of prehistoric site CA-ELD-26/H. This impact would be less than significant.

Implementation of Alternative 1 would eliminate user-created trails at and near prehistoric site CA-ELD-26/H and
UTRM-1. The removal of these trails would reduce existing adverse effects on the integrity of these sites. The
long-term use of the bike path proposed in the immediate vicinity of site CA-ELD-26/H has the potential to draw
attention to the location and character of these potentially significant sites, and to facilitate looters or casual
souvenir hunters removing surface artifacts or engaging in illicit subsurface excavation. Such activities could
affect the integrity of this site over time, dramatically reducing the data potential, and physical integrity and
setting of CA-ELD-26/H. Such losses of data potential and integrity could cause this resource to be determined no
longer eligible for listing on the NRHP/CRHR. Because of these potential effects and the fact the bike path loop
cannot be redesigned, this facility will be removed from the final design. The bike path that is proposed to connect
the Rubicon Trail access point to the Al Tahoe neighborhood will remain in the project because it is not in the
vicinity of site CA-ELD-26/H. Furthermore, as described in EC 2 (Table 2-6), the Conservancy would prepare a
cultural resources protection plan that would include assurances that final design placement and orientation of
recreation facilities would incorporate features to minimize visibility and access that could otherwise lead to
damage or destruction of prehistoric site CA-ELD-26/H. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

IMPACT
3.3-1
(Alt. 2)

Damage to or Destruction of Documented Potentially Significant Cultural Resources during
Construction. (CEQA 1, 2; TRPA 1, 2) One potentially significant cultural resource (CA-ELD-26/H) has been
identified within the study area and could be adversely affected during construction. However, as described in
Environmental Commitment 2, the Conservancy would prepare a cultural resources protection plan that would
include oversight of grading in staging areas that are in the vicinity of significant resources. Furthermore,
staging proposed on the bluff will completely avoid the CA-ELD-26/H site. Therefore, this impact would be less
than significant.

A total of 16 prehistoric and historic-era sites, features, and artifacts have been identified within the study area.
Of these, only one prehistoric site, CA-ELD-26/H, is recommended as significant under CEQA, NEPA, and
TRPA criteria. Site CA-ELD-26/H is recommended as eligible for listing in the NRHP and CRHR because of its
importance to the Washoe people as a fishing camp and for its data potential; future research could provide
information important to researching issues related to prehistoric and ethnographic Washoe occupation of the
Tahoe Basin. Under Alternative 2, no permanent features are proposed in the vicinity of CA-ELD-26/H; however,
staging areas and haul roads have the potential to affect portions of the landform in the vicinity of the Highland
Woods subdivision, where materials associated with site CA-ELD-26/H have been documented. As evidenced by
archaeological and ethnographic information, the edge of this landform (a low bluff situated above the marsh)
would have been an important habitation and activity locale for the Washoe during prehistoric periods and into
the historic era. Proposed staging areas and haul roads in the vicinity of the Rubicon Trail access points (to the
study area) have the potential to uncover in-situ artifacts and features directly related to site CA-ELD-26/H.
As described in EC 2, “Prepare and Implement a Cultural Resources Protection Plan” (Table 2-6), the
Conservancy would install construction barriers around site CA-ELD-26/H, educate construction workers about
site protection requirements, and ensure that a qualified cultural resource specialist would oversee initial grading

activities within the vicinity of the bluff. The purpose of this monitoring would be to ensure that cultural resources
potentially uncovered during ground-disturbing activities are identified, evaluated for significance, and treated in
accordance with their possible NRHP and CRHR status. Potential treatment methods for significant and
potentially significant resources may include but would not be limited to taking no action (i.e., resources
determined not to be significant), avoiding the resource by changing construction methods or project design, and
implementing a program of testing and data recovery, in accordance with all applicable federal and state
requirements. With implementation of EC 2, this impact would be less than significant.

(Alt. 2)

Damage to or Destruction of Undocumented Potentially Significant Cultural Resources during
Construction. (CEQA 1, 2; TRPA 1, 2) Although the study area has been surveyed for cultural resources,
significant buried archaeological materials may be present that could be adversely affected by project grading
and excavation. However, as described in Environmental Commitment 2, the Conservancy would prepare a
cultural resources protection plan that would include oversight of grading in known resource areas and training
of project construction personnel on the possibility of encountering significant resources; if such resources
were encountered, proper measures would be taken to protect them. This impact would be less than
significant.

This impact would be the same as Impact 3.3-2 (Alt. 1). For the same reasons as described above, this impact
would be less than significant.

(CEQA 3) Project-related construction activities could uncover or otherwise disturb previously undiscovered
prehistoric or historic-era human remains. However, as described in Environmental Commitment 3, the
Conservancy and its contractor would stop work and inform the El Dorado County Coroner of the discovery of
human remains if uncovered during project construction. This impact would be less than significant.

This impact would be the same as Impact 3.3-3 (Alt. 1). For the same reasons as described above, this impact
would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.3-4
(Alt. 2)

Damage to or Destruction of Documented Potentially Significant Cultural Resources Resulting from
Public Access Features. (CEQA 1, 2; TRPA 1, 2) Alternative 2 does not include public access features that
could draw attention to the location and character of significant cultural resources, or that could facilitate
access to areas where significant cultural resources have been documented. This impact would be less than
significant.

An increase in public attention or access, with accompanying increased risks for looting or artifact collecting,
would constitute a potentially significant impact. Because Alternative 2 does not include operating paths or
viewpoints in the immediate vicinity of significant cultural resources, there would not be an increase in public
attention or access to significant cultural resources documented within the study area. Consequently, Alternative 2
does not pose a long-term threat to the integrity of sites, features, or artifacts recommended as eligible for listing
in the NRHP and CRHR. This impact would be less than significant.

Damage to or Destruction of Documented Potentially Significant Cultural Resources during
Construction. (CEQA 1, 2; TRPA 1, 2) One potentially significant cultural resource (site CA-ELD-26/H) has
been identified within the study area and could be adversely affected by construction and/or implementation of
Alternative 3. However, as described in Environmental Commitment 2, the Conservancy would prepare a
cultural resources protection plan that would include oversight of grading in areas that could have the potential
to find significant resources. Additionally, project construction personnel would be trained on the possibility of
encountering potentially significant resources; if such resources were encountered, proper measures would be
taken to protect them. Furthermore, final design of the bike path/pedestrian trail will completely avoid the bluff
area and CA-ELD-26/H. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

Alternative 3 proposes the construction of a bike path within the boundaries of and in the vicinity of site
CA-ELD-26/H. Alternative 3 also proposes to construct access haul roads and staging areas immediately adjacent
to the CA-ELD-26/H site. Construction of the proposed recreational facilities, access/haul roads, and staging areas
has the potential to affect portions of site CA-ELD-26/H (recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP and
CRHR) and/or artifacts and features possibly associated with this site that have not yet been documented on the
landform located above the marsh. As described in EC 2 (Table 2-6), the Conservancy would prepare and
implement a cultural resources protection plan. As part of the plan, construction barriers would be installed
around site CA-ELD-26/H, construction workers would be educated about site protection requirements, and a
qualified cultural resource specialist would oversee initial grading activities in the vicinity of the bluff.
Furthermore, because the proposed bike path/pedestrian trail loop on the bluff cannot be redesigned around the
CA-Eld-26/H site, the facility will be removed from the final design.
Potential treatment methods for significant and potentially significant resources may include but would not be
limited to taking no action (i.e., resources determined not to be significant), avoiding the resource by changing
construction methods or project design, and implementing a program of testing and data recovery, in accordance
with all applicable federal and state requirements. With implementation of EC 2, this impact would be less than

site, it will be removed from the final design. This impact would be less than significant.

This impact would be similar to Impact 3.3-4 (Alt. 1) except for the fact there would be no bike path connecting
the Rubicon Trial access point to the Al Tahoe neighborhood and therefore would not need special design features
to reduce potential impacts to the CA-ELD-26/H site. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

Alternative 4 proposes the construction of a bike path either on or within the immediate vicinity of site CA-ELD­
26/H. Ground-disturbing activities associated with the construction of this path have the potential to physically
disturb or destroy site CA-ELD-26/H. Alternative 4 would also include several staging areas; two would be
placed north of the Sunset Drive Access Point and one on the Conservancy parcel south of U.S. 50. Construction
of the proposed bike path and staging areas has the potential to affect portions of the landform in the vicinity of
the Highland Woods subdivision, where materials associated with site CA-ELD-26/H have been documented. As

BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES: VEGETATION AND WILDLIFE

This section describes the vegetation and wildlife (terrestrial biological) resources that are known or have the
potential to occur in the study area and the project vicinity. These resources include common vegetation, wildlife,
and sensitive habitats; and special-status plant and animal species. Aquatic resources are discussed in Section 3.5,
“Fisheries.” Cumulative vegetation and wildlife impacts are addressed in Section 3.16, “Cumulative Impacts.”
Consistency with TRPA goals and policies is presented in Section 3.10, “Land Use,” Table 3.10-1. The project’s
effects on thresholds are described in Section 4.5, “Consequences for Environmental Threshold Carrying
Capacities.”

Goals and Policies
The Conservation Element (Chapter IV) of the TRPA Goals and Policies establishes goals for the preservation,
development, utilization, and management of natural resources within the Tahoe Basin (TRPA 2006). These
policies and goals are designed to achieve and maintain adopted environmental threshold carrying capacities and
are implemented through the TRPA Code of Ordinances.
The Conservation Element includes ten subelements that address the range of Lake Tahoe’s natural and historical
resources. The Vegetation, Wildlife, and Stream Environment Zone subelements are discussed in this section, and
the goals related to each of these subelements are identified below.
Chapter IV of the Goals and Policies identifies the following five goals for vegetation:
►

Provide for a wide mix and increased diversity of plant communities.

►

Provide for maintenance and restoration of such unique ecosystems as wetlands, meadows, and other riparian
vegetation.

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Vegetation and Wildlife Resources

►

Conserve threatened, endangered, and sensitive plant species and uncommon plant communities.

►

Provide for and increase the amount of late seral/old-growth stands.

►

Retain appropriate stocking levels and distribution of snags and coarse woody debris in the region’s forests to
provide habitat for organisms that depend on such features and to perpetuate natural ecological processes.

The two goals identified for wildlife are as follows:
►

Maintain suitable habitats for all indigenous species of wildlife without preference to game or nongame
species through maintenance of habitat diversity.

►

Preserve, enhance, and where feasible, expand habitats essential for threatened, endangered, rare, or sensitive
species found in the Basin.

The Stream Environment Zone (SEZ) subelement contains an additional goal:
►

Provide for the long-term preservation and restoration of SEZs.

In addition to these broader goals identified within the Conservation Element, special attainment goals have been
developed to further focus management efforts and provide a measure of progress. These attainment goals are
defined by the TRPA Thresholds. The Conservation Element specifically identifies several attainment goals or
thresholds for certain vegetation and wildlife resources. TRPA thresholds are discussed in the “TRPA
Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities” section below.
Code of Ordinances
The applicable provisions of the TRPA Code of Ordinances regarding vegetation and wildlife are summarized
below.
Protection and Management of Vegetation
The Code of Ordinances requires the protection and maintenance of all native vegetation types. Section 61.3,
“Vegetation Protection and Management,” provides for the protection of SEZ vegetation, other common
vegetation, uncommon vegetation, and sensitive plants (TRPA 2011). TRPA defines an SEZ as an area that owes
its biological and physical characteristics to the presence of surface water or groundwater. The term SEZ includes
perennial, intermittent, or ephemeral streams; meadows and marshes; and other areas with near-surface water
influence within the Tahoe Basin. No project or activity may be implemented within the boundaries of an SEZ
except as otherwise permitted for habitat improvement, dispersed recreation, vegetation management, or as
provided in Chapter 30 of the Code of Ordinances.
Protection of Sensitive and Uncommon Plants
Section 61.3.6, “Sensitive and Uncommon Plant Protection and Fire Hazard Reduction,” of the TRPA Code of
Ordinances establishes standards for preserving and managing sensitive plants and uncommon plant communities.
Projects and activities that are likely to harm, destroy, or otherwise jeopardize sensitive plants or their habitat
must fully mitigate their significant adverse effects. Measures to protect sensitive plants and their habitat include:
►
►
►
►
►

fencing to enclose individual populations or habitat;
restricting access or intensity of use;
modifying project design as necessary to avoid adverse impacts;
dedicating open space to include entire areas of suitable habitat; or
restoring disturbed habitat.

Tree Removal
TRPA regulates the management of forest resources in the Tahoe Basin to achieve and maintain the
environmental thresholds for species and structural diversity, to promote the long-term health of the resources,
and to create and maintain suitable habitats for diverse wildlife species. Provisions for tree removal are provided
in Section 61.1 of the Code of Ordinances. Chapter 36 and Sections 33.6, 61.3.6, and 61.4 also include provisions
for tree protection during project design and implementation. Tree removal requires the review and approval of
TRPA (TRPA 2011).
Project proponents must obtain a tree permit from TRPA for all cutting of trees greater than 14 inches in diameter
at breast height (dbh). (At its November 2007 meeting, the TRPA Governing Board approved an increase in the
tree-diameter threshold for a permit from 6 inches to 14 inches; the revised ordinance that reflects this change is
currently in effect [Thayer, pers. comm., 2008].) However, trees of any size marked as a fire hazard by a fire
protection district or fire department that operates under a memorandum of understanding with TRPA can be
removed without a separate tree permit.
Trees greater than 30 inches dbh must be retained, except under circumstances specified in the Code of
Ordinances. As stated in Section 61.1.4.B of the TRPA Code of Ordinances:
Within non-SEZ urban areas, individual trees larger than 30 inches dbh that are healthy and
structurally sound shall be retained as desirable specimen trees having aesthetic and wildlife
value, unless no reasonable alternative exists to retain the tree, including reduction of parking
areas or modification of the original design.
In addition, trees and vegetation not scheduled to be removed must be protected during construction in accordance
with Section 33.6 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances.
If a project would result in substantial tree removal (as defined by TRPA Code Section 61.1.8), a tree removal or
harvest plan must be prepared by a qualified forester for approval by TRPA. The required elements of this plan
are described in Section 61.1.5.C of the Code of Ordinances.
The Code of Ordinances (Chapter 62) also provides quantitative requirements for snag and coarse woody debris
retention and protection by forest type in terms of size, density, and decay class.
Wildlife
TRPA sets standards for preserving and managing wildlife habitats, with special emphasis on protecting or
increasing habitats of special significance, such as deciduous trees, wetlands, meadows, and riparian areas (TRPA
Code of Ordinances, Chapter 62). Specific habitats that are protected include riparian areas, wetlands, and SEZs;
wildlife movement and migration corridors; important habitat for any species of concern; critical habitat necessary
for the survival of any species; nesting habitat for raptors and waterfowl; fawning habitat for deer; and snags and
coarse woody debris. In addition, TRPA special-interest species, which are locally important because of rarity or
other public interest, and species listed under the ESA or CESA are protected from habitat disturbance by
conflicting land uses.
Section 62.3.2 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances includes the following requirements for protection of wildlife
movement and migration corridors:
►

SEZs adjoining creeks and major drainages link islands of habitat and shall be managed, in part, for use by
wildlife as movement corridors. Structures, such as bridges, proposed within these movement corridors shall
be designed to not impede the movement of wildlife.

Vegetation and Wildlife Resources

►

Projects and activities in the vicinity of deer migration areas shall be required to mitigate or avoid significant
adverse impacts. The location of deer migration areas shall be verified by the appropriate state wildlife or fish
and game agencies.

The Code of Ordinances also contains several provisions regarding “critical habitat.” TRPA defines critical
habitat as any element of the overall habitat for any species of concern that, if diminished, could reduce the
existing population or impair the stability or viability of the population. This applies also to habitat for specialinterest species native to the Tahoe Basin whose breeding populations have been extirpated, but could return or be
reintroduced. Section 62.2.3 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances includes the following critical-habitat provisions:
►

No project or activity shall cause, or threaten to cause, the loss of any habitat component considered critical to
the survival of a particular wildlife species.

►

No project or activity shall threaten, damage, or destroy nesting habitat of raptors and waterfowl or fawning
habitat of deer.

►

Wetlands shall be preserved and managed for their ecological significance, including their value as nursery
habitat to fishes, nesting and resting sites for waterfowl, and as a source of stream recharge, except as
permitted pursuant to Chapter 30 of the Code of Ordinances.

►

Projects or activities within wetlands may include the creation of artificial nesting sites for waterfowl.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
To evaluate and describe the presence and quality of common and sensitive biological resources in the study area,
and to identify potential effects of project implementation on those resources, EDAW (now AECOM) biologists
conducted reconnaissance surveys of the site and reviewed the following existing data sources for the
Conservancy:
►

2006a);

►

►

List of Endangered and Threatened Species that Occur or May be Affected by Projects in the South Lake
Tahoe (522B) USGS 7.5 Minute Quad (USFWS 2010);

►

Several focused and reconnaissance-level surveys for wildlife resources have been conducted by ecologists (e.g.,
Borgmann and Morrison 2004), since restoration planning was initiated in the mid-1990s.

In support of the project, AECOM botanists conducted a survey for special-status plants in the study area on July
25–27, 2007, following CDFG’s Guidelines for Assessing the Effects of Proposed Development on Rare,
Threatened, and Endangered Plants and Plant Communities (CDFG 2000) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service’s (USFWS’s) Guidelines for Conducting and Reporting Botanical Inventories for Federally Listed,
Proposed, and Candidate Plants (USFWS 1996). This is considered a “protocol-level” survey (i.e., a survey
following specific protocols as determined by appropriate resource agencies). A letter report discussing the
findings of this survey is included as an appendix to this document (Appendix G). In conjunction with the specialstatus plant survey, reconnaissance surveys for vegetation were also conducted by AECOM botanists Mark Bibbo
and Richard Dwerlkotte on July 25–27, 2007.
Overview
The study area is approximately 592 acres, excluding the lake area and approximately 40 acres of upland adjacent
to the marsh proper. The study area is bordered on the east, south, and west by residential or commercial
development; Lake Tahoe borders the study area on the north.
The study area contains the largest remaining wetland in the Tahoe Basin and is a significant conservation area on
the south shore of Lake Tahoe. A substantial portion of the study area is cited by Murphy and Knopp (2000) as
one of five Ecologically Sensitive Area marshes in the basin because of its size, uniqueness, and potential to
support high levels of biodiversity. Wetlands and riparian areas such as those found in the study area provide
important habitat for wildlife. The soil and vegetation complexes of riparian and wetland systems produce
structurally heterogeneous vegetation and aquatic ecosystems, frequently resulting in diverse biological
communities. Many of the wildlife species found in the Tahoe Basin are dependent on aquatic or riparian
communities or use riparian environments for some aspect of their life history (Manley and Schlesinger 2001).
Most of the study area is designated as a TRPA threshold site (Upper Truckee Marsh threshold site) for waterfowl
and wintering bald eagles and uncommon plant communities. Therefore, a nondegradation standard applies to this
site, which means that no disturbance is permitted on the site that would reduce habitat quality for these species.
Recreation in the study area is of particular concern because of its potential effects on wildlife (Conservancy
2001). Existing patterns of recreation are described in Section 3.13, “Recreation.” Recreational activities reported
in the study area include hiking, jogging, mountain biking, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, dog-walking, hotair ballooning, tube or raft floating, boating, canoeing, kayaking, fishing, and beach access (Conservancy 2001).
Unauthorized recreation activities are known to occur in the study area, including camping and unleashed dog
walking. Unauthorized recreational activities in the marsh are an existing source of wildlife disturbance.
Unauthorized recreation has also resulted in a user-created network of trails and other disturbed areas throughout
the study area. (These trails are described in Section 3.6, “Geology and Soils, Mineral Resources, and Land
Capability and Coverage,” and in Section 3.13, “Recreation.”)
The following sections describe the vegetation types and the primary wildlife habitat functions provided in the
study area.
Vegetation
The study area is characterized by a continuum of plant communities, ranging from predominantly forested areas
at the highest elevations to wet meadow and riparian areas along the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek, to
lagoon and sandy barrier beach along the shores of Lake Tahoe. Vegetation types in the study area have been
previously described and mapped in technical reports prepared for the project. Vegetation was most recently
mapped and described in detail in Processes and Functions of the Upper Truckee Marsh (Conservancy and DGS
2003). The vegetation map created for that report was updated in the field during the special-status plant survey
conducted by AECOM botanists in July 2007 (Appendix G). Updates and changes to the location and extent of
vegetation communities on the study area were recorded with a Global Positioning System (GPS) in the field,
digitized for entry into a geographic information system (GIS), and used to create an updated vegetation map that

accurately reflects current conditions (Exhibit 3.4-1). Plant community names shown on the maps and described
below are a combination of names used in previous reports describing vegetation (Conservancy and DGS 2003;
WBS 1995, 1999) and other Californian and Sierran vegetation classifications (Elliott-Fisk et al. 1997; Holland
1986; Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf 1995; Fites-Kaufman 2007).
Jeffrey Pine Forest
This upland plant community occurs around the edges of the study area at the highest elevations. These upland
locations are relatively well drained, and growing conditions are drier than elsewhere in the study area. The
canopy of the Jeffrey pine community is dominated by Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), but white fir (Abies concolor)
also occurs. In California, Jeffrey pine is found as a dominant species in a wide range of physical conditions and
from elevations as low as 500 feet to as high as 9,500 feet (Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf 1995). In the Sierra Nevada,
communities dominated by Jeffery pine typically occur at about 6,000–8,000 feet in elevation (Holland 1986).
The composition of understory species on the west slope of the Sierra Nevada differs from that on the east slope,
and stands in the study area show east-slope affinities. Common species in the study area in the shrub layer
include wax currant (Ribes cereum), tobacco brush (Ceanothus velutinus), bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata), rubber
rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus nauseosus), greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula), and wood rose (Rosa
woodsii). The herbaceous understory is typically dominated by nonnative grasses, including Kentucky bluegrass
(Poa pratensis), domestic timothy (Phleum pratense), and creeping bent grass (Agrostis stolonifera), but can also
include native sedges (Carex spp.) and rushes (Juncus spp.) in moister, lower elevation areas within the uplands.
Lodgepole Pine Forest
Lodgepole pine occurs on lower, more mesic (i.e., wet) sites than Jeffrey pine, especially in areas that are
transitional to montane meadow. The largest stands of lodgepole pine in the study area occur on the southern half
of the property. This plant community is characterized by open canopies of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var.
murrayana) with an understory that may include willow and herbaceous species. Willow species present include
Lemmon’s willow (Salix lemmonii), shining willow (S. lucida ssp. lasiandra), and Geyer’s willow (S. geyeriana).
Dominant herbs include Kentucky bluegrass, woolly sedge (Carex lanuginosa), Baltic rush (Juncus balticus),
aster (Aster occidentalis), yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and checker mallow (Sidalcea oregana). Relatively
open-canopied stands can have well-developed understories with an abundance of wildflowers such as ranger’s
buttons (Sphenosciadium capitellatum), lupine (Lupinus polyphyllus), hedge nettle (Stachys ajugoides), scarlet
gilia (Ipomopsis aggregata), western buttercup (Ranunculus occidentalis), cinquefoil (Potentilla spp.), and Indian
paintbrush (Castilleja miniata).
Montane Meadow
Montane meadow is an herbaceous plant–dominated community that encompasses a range of moisture and soil
conditions that result in differences between dominant plant species. The location of these varying clusters of
species is dynamic, based on changing lake and groundwater levels, and no attempt has been made to map
meadow subtypes. Areas mapped as montane meadow also include the recently restored and still developing
vegetation of the wetland portion of the Lower West Side (LWS) Restoration Project area. Montane meadows are
scattered within forests throughout the Sierra Nevada at low-lying landscape positions (Holland 1986). Plants in
this community are “hydrophytes,” meaning they are specially adapted to tolerating and persisting in saturated
soil conditions. The hydrophytic vegetation of montane meadows is maintained by high groundwater levels,
typically supported by streams that flow through the meadow. Soils are usually fine-textured and are typically
saturated for most of the growing season. Plant cover is generally high.
A suite of sedges, rushes, and grasses dominates in various locations within the montane meadow in the study
area. Important species include Baltic rush, Nevada rush (Juncus nevadensis), straight-leaved rush
(J. orthophyllus), field sedge (Carex praegracilis), beaked sedge (Carex utriculata), water sedge (C. aquatilis),
common spikerush (Eleocharis macrostachya), tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia cespitosa), domestic timothy, and

Kentucky bluegrass. Characteristic forbs include aster, arnica, cinquefoil, and Douglas’ knotweed (Polygonum
douglasii). Some areas support large stands of a single species, typically domestic timothy, spikerush, field sedge,
or Baltic rush. Baltic rush appears particularly adaptable, persisting in relatively dry areas, such as the fringes of
the meadow, and in areas subject to periodic sustained flooding, such as behind the barrier beaches (Barton and
East Barton Beaches).
Willow Scrub–Wet Meadow
In the study area, willow scrub–wet meadow occurs primarily in association with stream channels and as scattered
patches within the floodplain of streams. Individual willows may be found outside of riparian flood zones, but
areas dominated by willows are always closely associated with the floodplain. The large area of willow scrub–wet
meadow in the center of the study area appears to be associated with old, abandoned stream channels. The canopy
of willow scrub can be dense to open and is dominated by Lemmon’s willow, Geyer’s willow, and shining
willow. Dense stands of willow scrub typically lack an understory. In more open stands, the understory is
dominated by montane meadow herbaceous species such as sedges, creeping bent grass, domestic timothy, and
slender wheatgrass (Elymus trachycaulus var. trachycaulus). The following forbs are also common: cinquefoil,
aster, arnica (Arnica chamissonis var. foliosa), and slender willow-herb (Epilobium ciliatum var. ciliatum).
Lagoon and Open Water
Periodically, additional open-water habitat is created by high lake levels, high groundwater levels, and the pooling
of surface water behind the barrier beaches. The presence and size of an extensive lagoon currently depends
largely on the lake level, although this was not necessarily the case in the past. The lagoon was largely absent in
1995 surveys but extensive in 1998 because of a higher lake level (Conservancy and DGS 2003). A small portion
of the study area was reported as flooded in 1995, but the location was not mapped. A small area of lagoon was
also present in summer 2002, after two dry winters resulted in a lower lake level. The lagoon area present in 2002
was formed by pooling of Trout Creek behind the barrier beaches. By 2007, after 5 years of higher lake levels, the
lagoon was extensive. The lagoon is characterized by aquatic and emergent plant species including yellow pondlily (Nuphar luteum ssp. polysepalum), yellow water buttercup (Ranunculus flabellaris), white water buttercup
(R. aquatilis var. capillaceus), pondweed species (Potamogeton spp.), common waterweed (Elodea canadensis),
common bladderwort (Utricularia vulgaris), water smartweed (Polygonum amphibium var. stipulaceum), Baltic
rush, and beaked sedge.
In addition to the natural lagoons that exist in the study area, a human-made lagoon feature exists in the
northwestern portion of the study area. This lagoon is part of the Tahoe Keys Marina and is commonly referred to
as the “Sailing Lagoon.” Unlike the natural lagoons associated with Barton and East Barton Beaches, which are
affected by lake level, groundwater level, and condition of the barrier beaches, the Sailing Lagoon is connected to
a marina that is actively dredged to provide a clear channel for motorized boats to access Lake Tahoe. The Sailing
Lagoon is a highly disturbed area and provides limited biological values. Stabilization features (e.g., riprap)
border much of the lagoon. The vegetation characteristics of the Sailing Lagoon differ significantly from those in
natural lagoon habitat. Aquatic vegetation is dominated primarily by the nonnative Eurasian watermilfoil,
Myriophyllum spicatum, and willow species grow along the edge, between the Sailing Lagoon’s open water and
the adjacent upland habitat.
Beach and Dune
A series of plant communities occur along the sandy barrier beach and dune ridge that separates other plant
communities on the study area from the open water of Lake Tahoe. “Beach” is defined here as the area of sandy
substrate subject to wave action and exposed between high and low lake levels. Above the elevation of the current
maximum lake level is a ridge of sand, largely stabilized by vegetation. In keeping with terminology frequently
used for barrier beach complexes, this area is referred to as “dune.” Barbour and Major (1988: 223–262),
describing California oceanic beaches, define dunes as the “sandy, open habitat which extends from the foredune

(or the furthest inland reach of storm waves) to typically inland vegetation on stabilized substrate.” This pattern is
analogous to what is observed in the study area, where the lakeside vegetation is highly dynamic, but the lagoonside vegetation consists largely of montane meadow species.
The beach and dune system is dynamic, as it is continually reshaped by erosion from wave action and affected by
wind, storm events, and lake level. The highest dune areas are less frequently disturbed and more densely
vegetated. The dune ridge is typically covered by a dense sod of water sedge and Nebraska sedge (Carex
nebrascensis), with some creeping wildrye (Leymus triticoides), meadow barley (Hordeum brachyantherum), and
silverleaf phacelia (Phacelia hastata). In contrast, the beach is more dynamic because it is more frequently
disturbed by wave action. The sandy beach area is continually subject to erosion and deposition. Plants establish
as the lake level retreats. This establishment often occurs at the elevational edge of a recent lake boundary,
creating progressive lines of vegetation.
The dynamic lakeside beach in the study area supports occurrences of the rare Lake Tahoe endemic, Tahoe yellow
cress (TYC) (Rorippa subumbellata). Tahoe yellow cress may be found growing alone or in association with
species such as silverleaf phacelia, cinquefoil, cudweed (Gnaphalium palustre), bur-marigold (Bidens laevis),
curly dock (Rumex crispus), monkeyflower (Mimulus primuloides), lupine, field mint (Mentha arvensis), and
beautiful spikerush (Eleocharis acicularis var. bella). The distribution of this rare plant is highly dynamic because
available habitat varies with lake level. Available habitat increases during dry periods as additional sand is
exposed and decreases during wetter periods (Conservancy and DGS 2006).
Restored Upland Shrubs
This vegetation type occurs only in the upland areas surrounding the restored montane meadow at the LWS
Restoration Area, in the northwestern portion of the study area. Shrubs typical of the understory of the study
area’s Jeffrey pine community were planted here in fall 2002. (Jeffrey pine itself was not planted).
Disturbed Areas
At several locations within the study area, vegetation has been removed or has been otherwise affected by human
activities, such as placement of fill. In addition to the disturbed areas shown in Exhibit 3.4-1, there is a usercreated network of trails and small disturbed areas throughout most vegetation types that has resulted from
unauthorized recreational activities. (These trails are described in Section 3.6, “Geology and Soils, Mineral
Resources, and Land Capability and Coverage,” and in Section 3.13, “Recreation.”)
The species composition of these disturbed areas varies. In most areas, herbaceous species dominate. Percent
cover varies widely depending on the level of disturbance. Among the species present are herbs such as yarrow,
slender willow-herb, aster, beardtongue (Penstemon speciosus), and dwarf lupine (Lupinus lepidus var. ramosus),
and grasses such as Kentucky bluegrass.
In the Cove East Beach area, west of the Upper Truckee River and north of the LWS Restoration Area, extensive
deposition of fill material and other human modifications of the substrate and vegetation have occurred. A portion
of this area is dominated by rubber rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus nauseosus). Areas dominated by rubber
rabbitbrush are typically maintained by disturbance such as fire, grazing, or soil tilling (Holland 1986).
Herbaceous species that occur in areas dominated by rubber rabbitbrush include mountain tarweed (Madia
glomerata), ground smoke (Gayophytum diffusum var. parviflorum), and cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum).
Cheatgrass is considered a widespread, aggressive invasive weed species by the California Invasive Plant Council
(Cal-IPC) (2006), with a “High” overall rating (species that have severe ecological impacts on physical processes,
plant and animal communities, and vegetation structure). In addition, infestations of perennial pepperweed
(Lepidium latifolium), another Cal-IPC species with a rating of “High,” are present near Trout Creek in the
southern portion of the study area.

Wildlife Habitat Functions
Wetlands and riparian areas often support diverse wildlife communities. Many of the wildlife species found in the
Tahoe Basin depend on aquatic or riparian communities or use riparian environments for some aspect of their life
history (Manley and Schlesinger 2001). As the largest remaining wetland adjacent to Lake Tahoe, much of the
study area contains important habitat for wildlife. The mix of terrestrial and aquatic habitats that exist in the study
area support a variety of common wildlife species. The site is also known or is likely to support some specialstatus wildlife species (see “Sensitive Biological Resources” below).
Appendix H, “Wildlife Species and Associated Terrestrial and Aquatic Habitats at the Upper Truckee Marsh,”
provides a list of approximately 200 amphibian, reptile, bird, and mammal species that have been observed or are
likely to occur in the study area. This list was compiled from the following sources:
►
►
►

survey data from the study area from 1999–2004 (TRPA 2002b, Borgmann and Morrison 2004),
Conservancy survey data from the study area from 2002 (Conservancy 2002), and
previous ecological studies within the study area (Conservancy 1997).

A general list of species occurrences in the Tahoe Basin was also reviewed (Murphy and Knopp 2000).
The wildlife species typically associated with each terrestrial or aquatic habitat are briefly described below. The
vegetation communities form a continuum of habitats (Exhibit 3.4-1) along hydrologic, elevation, and land use
gradients. Annual variability in environmental conditions influences the abundance and distribution of the
communities. Many wildlife species use several of the communities. In addition, the proximity of one community
to another may be essential for some species (e.g., willow flycatchers [Empidonax traillii] are associated with
willow scrub with areas of open water or saturated soils nearby). The following sections describe the conditions
and functions of these habitats.
Jeffrey Pine Forest
The Jeffrey pine community supports a variety of birds, including woodpeckers, nuthatches, and kinglets. The
trees provide perching habitat for many other species of birds, including bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus)
and great horned owls (Bubo virginianus). This community also supports small mammals such as vagrant shrew
(Sorex vagrans), yellow-pine chipmunk (Tamias amoenus), Douglas squirrel (Tamiasciurus douglasii), and
golden-mantled ground squirrel (Spermophilus lateralis).
Lodgepole Pine Forest
The lodgepole pine community provides perch sites for raptors that may use the meadow for foraging, such as
red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) and American kestrel (Falco sparverius). Kestrels may also nest in cavities
in these trees. Other cavity-nesting species such as tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), white-breasted nuthatches
(Sitta carolinensis), and red-breasted sapsuckers (Sphyrpicus ruber) may nest in this community. Some of the
species found in the Jeffrey pine or willow scrub–wet meadow communities may use the lodgepole pines as well,
but in general, species in this community include ones that prefer more open areas than a Jeffrey pine community,
and drier conditions than found in a willow scrub–wet meadow community.
Willow Scrub–Wet Meadow
The willow scrub–wet meadow community provides cover and forage for many species of songbirds. The willow
scrub–wet meadow community in the study area is also part of a TRPA threshold site for wintering bald eagle and
waterfowl. In general, this community can provide foraging and nesting habitat for flycatchers, warblers, and
sparrows. Riparian-associated species documented in willow scrub–wet meadow communities in the study area
during the breeding season include Wilson’s warbler (Wilsonia pusilla), song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), and
orange-crowned warbler (Vermivora celata). Yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia), a CDFG species of special

concern, also nests in willow scrub vegetation in the study area (Borgmann and Morrison 2004). Other species, such
as mountain chickadee (Poecile gambeli), ruby-crowned kinglet (Regulus calendula), and yellow-rumped warbler
(Dendroica coronata), use the willow scrub–wet meadow community as foraging habitat. The willows provide
especially important foraging habitat during migration, when birds require stopover habitats to rest and forage.
Other avian species restricted to riparian or scrub habitats, including willow flycatcher and MacGillivray’s
warbler (Oporornis tolmiei), have the potential to breed in this community in the study area. MacGillivray’s
warbler and willow flycatcher are expected to nest in dense willow thickets, and they are known to nest elsewhere
in the Tahoe Basin, but they have not been detected in the study area during recent breeding-season surveys
(TRPA 2002a, Conservancy 2002, Borgmann and Morrison 2004).
The structure of willows is an important component of nesting habitat for many birds. A possible explanation for
why these species are not breeding in the study area may be that the structure of the willows is unsuitable.
Grazing occurred in the study area in the past and has prevented the growth of young willows. The willow
thickets in the study area consist of very dense and mature trees. There is very little evidence of recruitment in
past years, resulting in even-aged stands. The monotypic structure and age may affect the suitability of the
willows to support these breeding songbirds. The nesting habitat of willow flycatcher is described in detail in the
“Sensitive Biological Resources” section to illustrate specific structural habitat requirements.
Several bat species have been detected on the site, and they likely forage in the willow scrub–wet meadow
communities. These species include hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), long-eared myotis (Myotis evotis), little brown
bat (M. lucifigus), and Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) (Borgmann and Morrison 2004).
Amphibian and reptile species that are known to occur in the study area, and that are likely to use willow scrub–
wet meadow communities, include Pacific tree frog (Hyla regilla) and western terrestrial garter snake
(Thamnophis elegans).
Montane Meadow
The montane meadow community is contained within a TRPA threshold site for nesting waterfowl, which include
species such as mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), cinnamon teal (Anas cyanoptera), and gadwall (Anas strepera).
The meadow is also part of a threshold site designated for wintering bald eagle.
The montane meadow in the study area provides habitat for many species of ground-nesting birds, supports
populations of small mammals, and provides foraging opportunities for raptors. Different species use different
aspects of the meadow as habitat. Water level is the primary factor that modifies habitats within the meadow;
some species prefer drier areas, others require moister conditions. For example, under drier conditions, the
meadow provides ideal nesting habitat for savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) and western
meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta), which nest near or on the ground. Small-mammal populations may increase
under moderately dry conditions, as long as seed production can support them. During wet years or under
conditions that promote water retention in the study area, the lagoon increases in size, and nesting sites for
savannah sparrows and meadowlarks may be limited to only the upland edges of the meadow. Suitable areas for
dry burrows may also limit populations of small mammals. Decreased populations of small mammals may result
in fewer foraging opportunities for raptors. However, the wetter conditions may favor red-winged blackbirds
(Agelaius phoeniceus), which prefer to nest in wet or moist areas where emergent vegetation is present. Species
such as Pacific treefrogs and long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) may breed successfully only
when conditions are wet enough for a sufficient length of time to maintain ponded areas for eggs to develop and
metamorphose.
Several mammal species that use montane meadow habitat have been documented on the site: montane vole
(Microtus montanus), vagrant shrew, deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), California ground squirrel
(Spermophilus beecheyi), coyote (Canis latrans), and black bear (Ursus americanus) (Borgmann and Morrison
2004). In Borgmann and Morrison’s 2004 study, montane vole was the most commonly detected small mammal

in the study area. Other small mammal species likely to occur in montane meadow habitat in the study area
include harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys megalotis) and western jumping mouse (Zapus princes). Small-mammal
populations provide foraging opportunities for raptors, such as northern harrier (Circus cyaneus) and American
kestrel.
Beach and Dune
The beach provides migration foraging habitat for shorebirds, such as western sandpiper (C. mauri), long-billed
dowitcher (Limnodromus scolopaceus), and willet (Catoptophorus semipalmatus). Shorebirds are more
commonly observed in the study area in the fall during their southerly migration (Orr and Moffitt 1971). The
beach and dune provide resting and nesting habitat for many species that use adjacent aquatic habitats for
foraging: gulls, terns, geese, and ducks. Species that may nest on the beach or in sparse vegetation within the dune
include Forster’s tern (Sterna forsteri), Wilson’s phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor), killdeer (Charadrius vociferus),
and spotted sandpiper (Actitis macularia).
Stream
In shallow-water areas at the stream edges, wading birds, such as great blue heron (Ardea herodias) and snowy
egret (Egretta thula), and shorebirds, such as spotted sandpiper, may be present. In areas where the river floods its
banks and creates fish-free ponds, suitable habitat for long-toed salamander is created. American beavers (Castor
canadensis) are active in the streams, and muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) have been observed within the study area
in the past. American beaver is not native to the Tahoe Basin (Schlesinger and Romsos 2000) and is a serious
management concern.
Borgmann and Morrison (2004) documented the occurrence of bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) in the study area. In
the western United States, bullfrog is a nonnative species and a serious management concern. Where it occurs,
this species preys on and reduces the population viability of native amphibians, snakes, rodents, and other species.
Lagoon
The lagoon creates habitat for waterfowl and other aquatic wildlife. Waterfowl and shorebirds are strongly
associated with lagoon habitats. Dabbling ducks, such as American widgeon (Anas americana), northern pintail
(Anas acuta), northern shoveler (Anas clypeata), cinnamon teal, gadwall, and mallard typically skim food from
the surface or tip forward to submerge their heads and necks. Most species of dabbling ducks forage in areas of 6–
10 inches of water or less. Diving ducks and other aquatic birds that actively dive to feed on submergent
vegetation or to pursue prey, such as ring-necked duck (Aythya collaris), common merganser (Mergus
merganser), pied-billed grebe (Podilymbus podiceps), and Forster’s tern, may require depths of 3–10 feet
(Grassland Water District 2001, cited in Conservancy and DGS 2003). Around the fringes of the lagoon where
tules (Typha sp.) and cattails (Scirpus sp.) grow, yellow-headed blackbirds (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus) may
nest. American beavers and muskrats may also be present in lagoon areas. Black terns (Chlidonias niger)
historically have nested in this area, but have not been reported in recent years (Shuford 1998).
The lagoon and adjacent terrestrial and aquatic habitats form a continuum of habitats in the study area, and as the
amount of one habitat increases the amount of another may decrease. If more water is retained in the marsh, a
larger lagoon will form and more nesting and foraging habitat may be available for grebes, ducks, geese, terns,
and yellow-headed blackbirds. As a consequence of a larger lagoon, however, there will be less meadow or
willow scrub–wet meadow area to support species associated with those communities.
Lake
The lake zone provides habitat for fish-eating birds such as grebes, mergansers, double-crested cormorants
(Palacrocorax auritas), terns, ospreys (Pandion haliaetus), and bald eagles. Other species that forage over open
water, such as swallows, may also be present. Geese and other waterbirds may roost on the lake as well.

Sensitive Biological Resources
In this analysis, sensitive biological resources include those that receive special protection through the TRPA
Code of Ordinances, ESA, CWA, U.S. Forest Service (USFS) Manual, or local plans, policies, and regulations; or
that are otherwise considered sensitive by federal, state, or local resource conservation agencies and
organizations. These resources are addressed in the sections below.
Special-Status Species
Special-status species are plants and animals that are legally protected or otherwise considered sensitive by
federal, state, or local resource conservation agencies and organizations. In this document, special-status species
are defined as:
►

species listed or proposed for listing as threatened, rare, or endangered under the ESA or CESA;

►

species considered as candidates for listing under the ESA or CESA;

►

wildlife species identified by CDFG as species of special concern;

►

animals fully protected under California Fish and Game Code;

►

species designated as sensitive, special interest, or threshold species by TRPA;

►

species designated as sensitive by the USFS Regional Forester in Region 5; or

►

plants on CNPS List 1B (plants that are rare, threatened, or endangered in California and elsewhere) or List 2
(plants that are rare, threatened, or endangered in California but more common elsewhere) (CNPS 2010).

Federal “species of concern” are no longer designated or recognized by USFWS; therefore, species previously
designated as such are not addressed in this section.
Special-Status Plants
A preliminary list of special-status plant species with potential to occur in the study area was developed based on
a review of the following:
►

the CNPS Electronic Inventory of Rare and Endangered Vascular Plants of California (CNPS 2010);

►

a list of special-status species known to occur within the South Lake Tahoe and eight surrounding U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute quadrangles obtained from the CNDDB (2010);

►

a list of species in the USFS Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit designated as sensitive species (USFS 2005);

►

a list of taxa designated by TRPA as sensitive or threshold species (TRPA 2002b); and

►

a list of federally endangered, threatened, or candidate species that may be affected by projects in the Tahoe
Basin (USFWS 2010).

►

The initial data review preliminarily identified 44 special-status plant, lichen, and fungi species that could
occur in the region. Table 3.4-1 contains information on all special-status plant species previously recorded in
the southern Tahoe Basin. Based on review of existing documentation and discussion with local botanists
with extensive experience with the site, 24 of these special-status plant species have the potential or are
known to occur in the study area.

During the special-status plant survey of the study area, one special-status plant species, American mannagrass
(Glyceria grandis), a CNPS List 2 species, was encountered that had not been previously reported from the study
area (Table 3.4-1). The known populations of TYC at Cove East and Barton Beaches were visited during this
survey. The locations of these populations of special-status species are shown in Exhibit 3.4-2 and are discussed
in more detail below.
American Mannagrass
American mannagrass is a rhizomatous grass (i.e., a grass with some below-ground stems) that is on CNPS List 2
(plants that are rare, threatened, or endangered in California but more common elsewhere) (CNPS 2010). The
species is much more common outside of California; it is found from Alaska to Newfoundland in the north
(including all of the northwestern, midwestern, mid-Atlantic, and northeastern states), in the mountains of
Arizona and New Mexico in the southwest, and north of North Carolina and Tennessee in the southeastern United
States. In California it is known from Fresno, Humboldt, Mendocino, Mono, Placer, and Tuolumne Counties.
There are no previously documented occurrences of American mannagrass in El Dorado County.
American mannagrass grows in riparian habitats, on streambanks, at lake margins, in meadows, and in bogs and
fens. It grows to a height of three feet tall and has a 7- to 15-inch-long, egg-shaped inflorescence (i.e.,
arrangement of flowers) bearing small spikelets (i.e., small groups of inconspicuous flowers). The grass flowers
between June and August. It is similar in overall appearance to fowl mannagrass (Glyceria elata), which is much
more common throughout the Sierra Nevada. It can also be confused with pale fake mannagrass (Torreyochloa
pallida). Photographs of American mannagrass can be found in Appendix G.
During AECOM’s special-status plant survey of the study area (July 25–27, 2007), American mannagrass was
found in one location growing on a low mud bench within one of the active channels of Trout Creek just above
the surface water. Associated species on the mud bench were pale fake mannagrass (Torreyochloa pallida),
beaked sedge, Baltic rush, fringed willow herb (Epilobium ciliatum), and wild mint (Mentha arvense).
Approximately 35 flowering stems were observed in a ten-square-foot area. Nearby mannagrass species, thought
to be fowl mannagrass, had a very different appearance characterized by much greener lemmas and inflorescence,
a slightly smaller inflorescence, and smaller, more rounded glumes.
Tahoe Yellow Cress
Tahoe yellow cress is a perennial herb with yellow flowers that is endemic to the sandy beaches of Lake Tahoe.
Part of the mustard family, TYC is a candidate for listing by USFWS, listed as endangered by the State of
California, and a TRPA threshold special-status species. It emerges above ground from perennial underground
roots between March and June and flowers between June and October. The sandy beach margin of Lake Tahoe is
the only known location of the species.
Tahoe yellow cress is thought to be very sensitive to disturbance by human activity (e.g., walking, running, dogwalking) (Pavlik, Murphy, and TYCTAC 2002:11 and 78; Conservancy and DGS 2006:15). It is also very
sensitive to lake level, with more occurrences present during low lake levels when more beach-zone habitat is
available for colonization (Pavlik, Murphy, and TYCTAG 2002; Stanton and Pavlik 2006). In response to low
numbers of TYC occurrences in the mid-1990s, a multiagency technical advisory group (TAG) was formed by
TRPA to develop and implement a conservation strategy for the species. The conservation strategy was written in
2002 (Pavlik, Murphy, and TYCTAC 2002), and a memorandum of understanding and conservation agreement
was signed by 13 state and local agencies and organizations to implement the strategy. Several studies have been
initiated since 2001, including TYC seed collection and trial outplantings.

Introduction and Statement of Purpose and Need

In 2005, members of the TAG transitioned to being members of an adaptive management working group
(AMWG), and the TAG is now a subcommittee of the AMWG. Part of implementing the conservation strategy is
ensuring that entities that manage properties with TYC occurrences have submitted a management plan or
information sheet to the AMWG (Stanton and Pavlik 2006). As a condition of TRPA approval for the Lower West
Side Wetland Restoration Project on Conservancy land, a TYC management plan was drafted for the populations
of TYC occurring on Cove East Beach (west of the Upper Truckee River mouth) and on Barton and East Barton
Beaches (east of the Upper Truckee River mouth) (Conservancy and DGS 2006). For monitoring purposes, these
populations have been separated into two segments. The segment of the population located on Cove East Beach
has been called Upper Truckee West, and the remaining part of the population on Barton and East Barton Beaches
has been called Upper Truckee East. The Upper Truckee West and Upper Truckee East populations are two of the
26 TRPA threshold population sites for TYC. The Upper Truckee East site is thought to support approximately
three-quarters of the total TYC population. The Conservancy maintains an exclosure that protects much of the
Upper Truckee East population from human activity.
The goals of the Conservancy’s TYC management plan are to:
►

manage the collective Upper Truckee West and Upper Truckee East TYC population on Cove East, Barton,
and East Barton Beaches within its natural range of variation so that it is stable or growing and not decreasing
in size as a result of effects from human use and/or Conservancy land management decisions;

►

base management decisions on the best scientific information available;

►

incorporate adaptive management strategies into the plan so that the Conservancy is both proactive in
researching TYC biology, possible effects on the population, and the best education and outreach approaches,
and reactive in terms of incorporating that research into new management policies; and

►

provide a consistent management framework over time.

Special-Status Wildlife
A preliminary list of special-status wildlife species known or with potential to occur in the study area was
developed based on a review of:
►

USFWS’s Federal Endangered and Threatened Species that Occur or May be Affected by Projects in the
South Lake Tahoe (522B) USGS 7.5 Minute Quad (USFWS 2010);

►

CDFG’s Special Animals report (CDFG 2009), which is a list of federally listed and state-listed taxa, CDFG
species of special concern, and other special-status animals;

►

a list of special-status species known to occur within the South Lake Tahoe and eight surrounding USGS
7.5-minute quadrangles obtained from the CNDDB (2007);

►

a list of species designated as sensitive by the USFS Regional Forester in Region 5 (USFS 2005); and

►

a list of taxa designated by TRPA as special-interest or threshold species (TRPA 2007).

The initial data review preliminarily identified 27 special-status wildlife species that could occur in or near the
study area. Twelve of the species evaluated are not expected or have a low potential to occur in the study area,
and 15 have a moderate to high likelihood to occur in the study area and vicinity. This determination was based
primarily on three factors: the types, extent, and quality of habitats in the study area; the proximity of the study
area to known extant occurrences of the species; and the regional distribution and abundance of the species.

Table 3.4-2 summarizes the potential for occurrence of each special-status wildlife species evaluated during this
analysis. Species with a moderate to high potential to occur in the study area, or that are known to occur, are
described below.
Bald Eagle
TRPA considers most of the study area a population threshold site for wintering bald eagles (as shown in
Exhibit 3.4-3). The bald eagle is listed as endangered under the CESA, designated as a sensitive species by USFS,
and designated as a special-interest species by TRPA; it is also fully protected under the California Fish and
Game Code. Effective August 8, 2007, the bald eagle was removed from the federal ESA by USFWS because of
the species’ population recovery throughout most of its range.
Bald eagles require large bodies of water or free-flowing streams with abundant fish and adjacent snags or other
perches for hunting. They generally nest in undisturbed coniferous forests, usually within a mile of a lake or
reservoir. Bald eagle habitat typically consists of several components—most significantly, close proximity to
large bodies of water and wetlands associated with lakes, mature coniferous stands with presence of dominant
trees, and adequate protection from human disturbance.
Bald eagles are known to nest in a few areas within the Tahoe Basin, including Emerald Bay and Marlette Lake
(USFS 2000). They are not expected to nest in the study area. In 1991, a study was conducted by Humboldt State
University to evaluate the Tahoe Basin for the support of nesting and wintering bald eagles. The study identified
ten areas on the California side of Lake Tahoe that could provide the necessary nesting structure for bald eagles.
Nine of the ten areas were determined to be unsuitable for nesting bald eagles.
The only site determined to be suitable was Emerald Bay, which has supported a nesting pair since 1997 (USFS
2000). Resident eagles and young produced in the Tahoe Basin, as well as migrants from other areas, are known
to use portions of the study area during the winter. During surveys conducted from 1998 to 2002, the population
of wintering bald eagles ranged between seven and 13 adults and zero to four juveniles (Sanchez, pers. comm.,
2004). Bald eagles are frequently observed during the summer foraging over the study area (Robinson, pers.
comm., 2003). Because only one pair is currently known to nest in the South Lake Tahoe area (USFS 2000), it is
assumed that the eagles observed are from the nesting territory at Emerald Bay, or are migrant visitors. They use
the conifers on the periphery of the study area for perching and roosting and the meadow, lagoon, and lake for
foraging. The shorezone is a critical habitat feature for bald eagles at Lake Tahoe (USFS 2000).
Bald eagles tend to favor lodgepole and Jeffrey pines as perching trees, but will also use aspen or willows. Preferred
perches typically are bordered by open areas, have stout horizontal branches, are tall and of large diameter, are close
to water and feeding areas, and provide a good view of the surrounding area. Trees used by wintering bald eagles in
the Tahoe Basin usually have open branches and either dead standing, dead topped, or some dead lateral branches in
a live crown. The trees favored for perches ranged from approximately 80 feet to 100 feet tall and were at least 40
feet taller than the understory of the surrounding stand (Laves and Romsos 2000).
Several known perch sites exist in the study area (as shown in Exhibit 3.4-3). These perch sites are regulated by
TRPA and are not to be disturbed. The proximity of these perches to foraging areas makes them particularly
valuable to eagles. Although TRPA establishes a buffer zone of 0.5 mile to protect bald eagle nests, the 2001 and
2006 TRPA threshold evaluation reports have not defined a recommended buffer around perch sites (TRPA
2002b, 2007). However, the threshold evaluations state that perching trees and nesting sites shall not be physically
disturbed; nor shall the habitat within the disturbance (buffer) zone around nest sites be manipulated in any
manner, unless needed to enhance habitat quality. Laves and Romsos (2000) recommend a buffer of 820 feet
around perch sites. Changes in water levels in the study area or changes in the river mouth and beach and dune
formation may affect the suitability and condition of the perch trees.

SI

Endemic California toad found in wet meadows
between 4,000–12,000 feet in the Sierra
Nevada from Alpine County south to Fresno
County.
Occurs in upper elevation lakes, ponds, bogs,
and slow-moving alpine streams. Most Sierra
Nevada populations are found between 6,000
and 12,000 feet elevation. Almost always found
within three ft. of water, and associated with
montane riparian habitats in lodgepole pine,
ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pine, sugar pine, white
fir, whitebark pine, and wet meadow vegetation
types. Alpine lakes inhabited by mountain
yellow-legged frogs generally have grassy or
muddy margin habitat, although below treeline
sandy and rocky shores may be preferred.
Suitable stream habitat can be highly variable,
from high gradient streams with plunge pools
and waterfalls, to low gradient sections through
alpine meadows, but low gradient streams are
preferred. Small streams are generally
unoccupied and have no potential breeding
locations due to the lack of depth for
overwintering and refuge (i.e., depths of several
feet or more).

Not expected to occur. The study area is
outside the known range of this species.

Usually occurs in permanent water with
abundant aquatic vegetation. Associated with
wet meadows, marshes, slow-moving streams,
bogs, ponds, potholes, and reservoirs.

Not expected to occur. Potentially suitable
habitat is present in the study area. However,
there have been no documented occurrences in
the region.

Uses ocean shorelines, lake margins, and river
courses for both nesting and wintering. Most
nests are within one mile of water in large trees
with open branches. Roosts communally in
winter.

Observed in study area (foraging). Resident
eagles and young produced in the Basin, as
well as migrants from other areas, are known
to perch in the study area during winter
months. The breeding pair from Emerald Bay
has also been observed foraging over the study

Low potential to occur. Potentially suitable
habitat is present in the study area. However,
the distance to known populations, presence of
predators (e.g., bullfrogs), and high level of
disturbance in the study area cause the

Bald Eagle Wintering Habitat Threshold Site and Perch Sites in Study Area

3.4-32

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

Recreational activities may adversely affect wintering bald eagles ( TRPA 2002a). The disturbance from
recreational activities may range in severity from distraction from normal activity to abandonment of wintering
areas. In 2002, TRPA considered the threshold and nondegradation standard for wintering bald eagle habitat to be
unattained because of documented observations of recreational disturbances (TRPA 2002b). In 2006, the
threshold for wintering bald eagle remained unattained (TRPA 2007).
The USFS has prepared a draft bald eagle management plan for the Tahoe Basin (USFS 2000). The plan
recommends educating the public regarding the ecology and sensitivity of bald eagles to disturbance, seasonally
or temporarily closing areas where eagles may be affected by recreational activities, and prohibiting construction
of new trails through areas considered important to eagles.
Osprey
The osprey is designated as a species of concern by CDFG and as a special-interest species by TRPA. Ospreys are
associated strictly with large fish-bearing waters and are known to forage in Lake Tahoe and in several other fishbearing lakes within the basin. In the Tahoe Basin, osprey nests are distributed primarily along the northern
portion of the east shore and southern portion of the west shore of Lake Tahoe. Other osprey nests in the basin are
located along the shorelines of smaller lakes (e.g., Fallen Leaf Lake), and in forest uplands up to 1.5 miles from
water.
Ospreys have been documented flying over the study area. They are not known to nest in the study area, but good
foraging and perch sites exist there. Because potential nest trees in the study area are located at the wet
meadow/upland edge and this habitat is relatively close to residential development throughout the study area, the
quality of nesting habitat for ospreys is considered low. However, the quality of foraging habitat in the study area
is relatively high, especially at the mouth of the Upper Truckee River. Ospreys may also use the river for foraging
occasionally.
Northern Goshawk, Cooper’s Hawk, and Sharp-Shinned Hawk
The northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Cooper’s hawk (A. cooperii), and sharp-shinned hawk (A. striatus) are
forest raptor species that have been detected in the study area. Each of these species is designated as a species of
special concern by CDFG. The northern goshawk is also considered sensitive by USFS Region 5 and is
considered a special-interest species by TRPA.
Northern goshawks generally require mature conifer forests with large trees, snags, downed logs, dense canopy
cover, and open understories for nesting. Foraging habitat for this species includes forests with dense to
moderately open overstories, and open understories interspersed with meadows, brush patches, riparian areas, or
other natural or artificial openings. Forest habitat in the study area lacks the characteristics of suitable nesting
habitat. A northern goshawk was previously observed in the study area. However, the detection was made in
September, when individuals tend to move from summer areas (Conservancy 1997). Therefore, this bird may
have been a dispersing juvenile or migrant. Although the goshawk has been observed in the study area, the lack of
suitable nesting habitat in the study area and the high level of disturbance in the upland area limit the potential for
the northern goshawk to nest there.
Cooper’s hawks and sharp-shinned hawks nest and forage in a variety of coniferous and mixed forest habitat
types. Cooper’s hawks will also forage in more open areas. Suitable foraging habitat exists in the study area in
upland areas, as well as in willow scrub–wet meadow. However, the small patches of forested habitat in the study
area may not be adequate for nesting. In addition, the level of disturbance, especially in and around the upland
area, limits the potential for these two species to use the site for nesting. The Cooper’s hawk and sharp-shinned
hawk have been detected in the study area as recently as 2000 (TRPA 2002a).

Northern Harrier
The northern harrier is designated as a species of concern by CDFG. It breeds in a variety of open grassland,
wetland, and agricultural habitats. Open wetland habitats used for breeding include marshy meadows, wet and
lightly grazed pastures, and freshwater and brackish marshes. Breeding habitat also includes dry upland habitats,
including grasslands, croplands, drained marshlands, and shrub-steppe in cold deserts. Vegetation height and
structure particularly affect the quality of northern harrier habitat, especially because this species is a ground nester.
Northern harriers winter throughout California where suitable habitat occurs, which includes open areas
dominated by herbaceous vegetation, including grasslands, pastures, croplands, coastal sand dunes, brackish and
freshwater marsh, and estuaries. The species is rarely known to occur in forested areas (Grinnell and Miller 1944,
Martin 1987, MacWhirter and Bildstein 1996).
Northern harriers have been observed periodically in the study area. It is not known whether they nest within the
study area, but they have been observed foraging over the site in both spring and fall (Conservancy 1997).
Northern harriers typically nest in areas that remain undisturbed during the nesting season. The level of
recreational activity in the study area throughout the summer months may limit its suitability for nesting.
Long-Eared Owl
The long-eared owl (Asio otus) is designated as a species of concern by CDFG. Specific habitat associations of
long-eared owl vary over the species’ range, and there has been confusion over whether it is a forest or opencountry species (Holt 1997). Long-eared owls nest in woodland, forest, and open (e.g., grassland, shrubsteppe,
desert) settings. Wooded and nonwooded areas that are occupied by long-eared owls often support relatively
dense vegetation (trees, shrubs) adjacent to or within larger open areas such as grasslands or meadows (e.g.,
habitat edges) (Bloom 1994; Marks, Evans, and Holt 1994; Small 1994). However, this species has also been
documented breeding in contiguous conifer forest habitat with heavy mistletoe infestation (Bull, Wright, and
Henjum 1989). In California, this species occurs in medium-aged and mature live oak and riparian woodlands.
Long-eared owls also breed in oak thickets and conifer forests at higher elevations (Zeiner et al. 1990).
Long-eared owls have been documented in the Tahoe Basin (Smith 2002), but their habitat use has not been well
studied. They have been detected during the breeding season, which indicates that they may breed in the area, but
their preferred habitat is not known. Long-eared owls have not been documented in the study area, but suitable
habitat may exist there in upland forests, willow scrub–wet meadow, or both.
Willow Flycatcher
Three subspecies of willow flycatcher occur in the Sierra Nevada: Empidonax traillii brewsteri, E. t. adastus, and
E. t. extimus. The willow flycatcher (all subspecies) is designated as sensitive by the Regional Forester and listed
as endangered under the CESA; additionally, E. t. extimus (southwestern willow flycatcher) is listed as
endangered under the ESA. The willow flycatcher was identified in the notice of intent for the Sierra Nevada
Forest Plan Amendment as one of seven aquatic, riparian, and meadow–dependent vertebrate species at risk in the
Sierra Nevada bioregion. This species is recognized by USFS Region 5 as the highest priority landbird species in
the Sierra Nevada bioregion, and is considered to have the highest likelihood of being extirpated from the Sierra
Nevada in the near future.
Willow flycatchers are migratory songbirds that nest in shrubby, wet habitats. In the Sierra Nevada, willow
flycatchers tend to prefer willow stands interspersed with open meadow and near standing or running water, often
associated with beaver meadows (Sedgwick 2000). Important characteristics of meadows suitable for breeding
willow flycatchers are a high water table that results in standing or slow-moving water, or saturated soils (e.g.,
“swampy” conditions); abundant cover of riparian deciduous shrubs (particularly willow); and riparian shrub
structure with moderate to high foliar density that is uniform from the ground to the shrub canopy (Sanders and
Flett 1989; Bombay 1999; Green, Bombay, and Morrison 2003). One study in the Sierra Nevada documented that
AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Vegetation and Wildlife Resources

California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

nests are typically located in willows with about 70 percent foliage cover. Nests are also typically found about 3–
4 feet above the ground and within about 7 feet from the edge of the clump (Sanders and Flett 1989).
Riparian habitat along streams can also function as suitable habitat for the willow flycatcher, although this is less
common in the Sierra Nevada. Those areas must support the hydrologic and vegetation characteristics described
for suitable meadows (e.g., standing or slow-moving water, abundant and dense riparian vegetation). Stream
channels that are high-gradient, deeply incised, and lacking a floodplain (e.g., potential for saturated soils or
standing water) and are characterized by a sparse or narrow riparian vegetation corridor are not suitable for
breeding willow flycatchers.
Although willow flycatchers have nested in meadows less than one acre in size, most nest in much larger meadows.
Harris, Sanders, and Flett (1987, 1988) reported that more than 80 percent of occurrences were in meadows larger
than about 20 acres. An area of approximately 2.5 acres was estimated as the minimum size required to support a
nesting pair of willow flycatchers in the Sierra Nevada (Sanders and Flett 1989). However, another study of 125
meadows in the Sierra Nevada showed that willow flycatchers were found only in meadows ten acres or larger,
although meadows as small as 0.6 acre have supported successful breeding flycatchers in the past (Harris,
Sanders, and Flett 1987). A recent summary of willow flycatcher occurrence data for the Sierra Nevada indicates
that occupied meadows range in size from 1 acre to 716 acres, averaging approximately 80 acres (USFS 2001).
Willow flycatchers were formerly known to nest by Trout Creek in the study area (Orr and Moffitt 1971). This
species was not detected in the study area during surveys conducted by Borgmann and Morrison (2004). Protocol
surveys for willow flycatcher conducted by AECOM biologists in 2011 located two male willow flycatchers
within the study area, but no evidence of nesting (AECOM 2011). Much of the study area may not provide
suitable habitat for nesting willow flycatchers (particularly in dry water years) because of its hydrologic
conditions and the current willow structure and distribution there (e.g., lack of saturated soils or standing water
within willow stands during the breeding season, limited dense willow cover in the floodplain). Some studies
have shown that areas consisting of solid, contiguous masses of willows do not support willow flycatchers
(Sanders and Flett 1989).
Yellow Warbler
The yellow warbler is designated by CDFG as a species of special concern; in addition, TRPA has proposed
adding it as a special-interest species because of its potential to serve as an indicator of riparian health (TRPA
2007). In the Sierra Nevada, yellow warblers typically breed in wet areas with dense riparian vegetation. Primary
breeding habitats are willow patches in montane meadows, and riparian scrub and woodland dominated by
willow, cottonwood, aspen, or alder with dense understory cover. Localized breeding has been documented
recently in more xeric sites, including chaparral, wild rose (Rosa spp.) thickets, and young conifer stands (Siegel
and DeSante 1999, RHJV 2004).
Willow scrub habitat in the study area provides suitable summer breeding and foraging habitat for yellow
warblers. Borgmann and Morrison documented yellow warblers breeding in the study area as recently as 2004;
however, they also observed a high level (50 percent or more) of nest parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds
(Molothrus ater).
Parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds has been identified as a major cause in reductions of yellow warbler
populations in the Sierra Nevada. High levels of cowbird parasitism can be the result of increased human
habitation and habitat alterations. Brown-headed cowbirds lay their eggs in the nests of other species, which in
turn reduces their hosts’ breeding productivity. This activity is known as brood parasitism. Brood parasitism
reduces productivity in two ways: brown-headed cowbirds typically remove an egg of the host before laying their
own egg in the nest, and cowbird nestlings often hatch before and develop more rapidly than the host young. As a
consequence, the adult hosts tend to provision more to the larger, more aggressive cowbird nestlings at the
expense of their own young. The severity of cowbird parasitism and its effect on populations of yellow warblers

within the study area could not be determined from the Borgmann and Morrison study because of their small
sample size (Borgmann and Morrison 2004).
Waterfowl
Waterfowl are strongly associated with lagoon habitats. Because nesting habitat for waterfowl is limited in the
Tahoe Basin, waterfowl are considered special-interest species by TRPA. Most of the study area is considered one
of 18 TRPA-designated threshold sites for nesting waterfowl (as shown in Exhibit 3.4-4). Surveys conducted by
USFS and TRPA indicate that the study area supports high species diversity, with a large number of species and
high mean relative abundance (number of individuals) of each species (TRPA 2002a).
Waterfowl species that are likely to nest in the Tahoe Basin include the mallard, northern pintail, northern
shoveler, cinnamon teal, American widgeon, gadwall, ring-necked duck, and common merganser. Most of these
species nest along shallow-water margins of streams or lakes, in areas of emergent vegetation or other vegetation
that provides concealment. Typically nests are in marshes or adjacent meadows and are scrapes on the ground
lined with grass (Ehrlich, Dobkin, and Wheye 1988). Most of these ducks are dabblers and feed on vegetation in
water approximately 6–10 inches deep. Ring-necked duck and common mergansers feed by diving under water
and use aquatic areas approximately 3–10 feet deep.
Cinnamon teal were formerly one of the most common nesters in the study area (Orr and Moffitt 1971); now,
however, they are only rarely seen there during the breeding season (TRPA 2002a). Mallards also bred at the
marsh in great numbers historically (Orr and Moffitt 1971). They are one of the most common species of
waterfowl still found at the marsh, but their numbers have been reduced from historical levels, probably because
of reductions in suitable habitat within the Tahoe Basin (TRPA 2002b).
Recreational activities and human access in wetlands may disrupt normal waterfowl behavior (Knight and Cole
1995). Because of increased recreational encroachment into wetland areas, the quality of waterfowl habitats at
TRPA-designated threshold sites has been degraded and the threshold standard is not in compliance with the
nondegradation standard (TRPA 2002b).
The Canada goose (Branta canadensis) has undergone dramatic population growth within the lower 48 states
(USFWS 2002). (The Pacific population of the Canada goose is Branta canadensis moffitti) Orr and Moffitt
(1971) report that only small numbers of Canada geese formerly nested in the study area. However, transplant
programs and habitat enhancement programs were undertaken in the past two decades to increase populations of
the Canada goose in the West (USFWS 2002). As a result, these populations have risen substantially enough that
Canada geese are increasingly coming into conflict with people and human activities. Conflicts between geese and
people affect or damage property, human health and safety, agriculture, and natural resources (USFWS 2002).
Consequently, Canada geese have become considered by some to be a nuisance species.
The Pacific population of the Canada goose is relatively nonmigratory, with most flocks wintering on or near their
nesting areas. They can be found in freshwater marshes and meadows, and, in urban areas, in golf courses and
lawns. Nests are usually near water and are made of dry grass, forbs, moss, sticks, and occasionally pine needles
or bark. They feed on shoots, roots, seed of grass sedges, grain and berries, and also some insects and crustaceans
(Ehrlich, Dobkin, and Wheye 1988).
Hoary Bat
The hoary bat is designated as a species of concern by CDFG. It is associated with a diverse array of forest
habitats that also contain open areas, which can provide edge habitat. Hoary bats are solitary and tend to roost in
the foliage of both coniferous and deciduous trees. Suitable roosting habitat exists in the study area along the
montane meadow/upland edge, and high-quality foraging habitat is present throughout the study area. Hoary bats
have been documented in various locations within the Tahoe Basin, including the study area, as recently as 2004
(Borgmann and Morrison 2004).

Western Red Bat
The western red bat (Lasiurus blossevilli) has a broad distribution ranging from Canada (British Columbia)
Canada, to Chile. In California, western red bat is designated as a species of concern by CDFG and considered
sensitive by USFS Region 5.
Suitable habitat includes edge habitats adjacent to streams or open fields, in orchards, and sometimes urban areas.
Roost sites are generally hidden from view in all directions; lack obstruction beneath, allowing the bat to drop
downward for flight; lack lower perches that would allow visibility by predators; have dark ground cover to
minimize solar reflection; have nearby vegetation to reduce wind and dust; and are generally located on the south
or southwest side of a tree. Roost sites may be associated with intact riparian habitat, particularly willow,
cottonwoods, and sycamores. Suitable habitat is present in the study area along the upland edge of montane
meadow and willow scrub–wet meadow. The species may also forage across the other habitats located in the
study area (e.g., wet meadow, lagoon, stream). Western red bats have been detected at Tallac Marsh, less than
4 miles west of the study area (Borgmann and Morrison 2004).
Sierra Nevada Snowshoe Hare
The Sierra Nevada snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus tahoensis) is listed as a species of concern by CDFG. In the
Sierra Nevada, this species in found only in boreal zones. Suitable habitat includes riparian communities with
thickets of willows and alders, and conifer forests with abundant cover composed of shrubs or small trees. In the
Tahoe Basin, snowshoe hares can be found in dense brush near the edges of meadows or riparian communities.
Montane meadow habitat and the willow scrub–wet meadow habitat in the study area provide suitable habitat for
this species. However, the distance of the study area from other suitable habitat and the level of disturbance in the
study area may limit the potential of occurrence for this species.
Sensitive Habitats
Sensitive habitats are those that are of special concern to resource agencies or that are afforded specific
consideration through the TRPA Goals and Policies and TRPA Code of Ordinances, Section 404 of the CWA, and
other applicable regulations. Sensitive natural habitats may be of special concern to these agencies and
conservation organizations for a variety of reasons, including their locally or regionally declining status, or
because they provide important habitat to common and special-status species. In the study area, the Upper
Truckee River and Trout Creek and the associated montane meadow, willow scrub–wet meadow, lodgepole pine,
and beach and dune communities are considered sensitive habitats. Some of the areas within these habitats are
designated as SEZs. Formal wetland delineations pursuant to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) guidelines
have not been completed for the study area, but much of the study area is in the floodplain of the Upper Truckee
River and Trout Creek. These areas would likely be considered jurisdictional by USACE and the Lahontan
Regional Water Quality Control Board under Section 404 of the Federal CWA and the State’s Porter-Cologne
Act, respectively.
As described previously for the entire study area, sensitive habitats in the study area are affected by existing
recreational activities, and unauthorized recreational activities have resulted in a number of trails and other
disturbed areas in sensitive habitats. (These trails are described in Section 3.6, “Geology and Soils, Mineral
Resources, and Land Capability and Coverage,” and in Section 3.13, “Recreation.”)
Other Ecologically Significant or Special-Interest Resources
In addition to special-status species and sensitive habitats, four other resources in the study area are considered
ecologically significant or of special interest: the riparian bird community and neotropical migrant landbirds, the
raptor community, wildlife movement corridors, and common migratory birds. These resources are discussed below.

Riparian Bird Communities and Neotropical Migrant Landbirds
The quality of riparian habitats and diversity of neotropical migrants in the southern portion of the Tahoe Basin
indicate the importance of this area to regional avian conservation and management. Montane meadow and wetmeadow habitats and the forested habitats in the study area provide habitat for numerous neotropical migrant bird
species during the breeding season, as well as during spring and fall migration.
Raptor Community
Raptors are considered ecologically significant as a group because they:
►

function at a high trophic level, and their populations are typically sensitive to the distribution and local
abundance of prey populations;

►

represent a wide range of life histories with respect to nesting, foraging, and habitat-use requirements;

►

include several species sensitive to habitat disturbance and loss; and

►

are generally visible and an important component of a wildlife viewing experience.

The extent and mix of forest and riparian/wet meadow habitats found in the study area provide winter, breeding,
and migration habitat for many raptor species known to occur over the larger region.
Wildlife Movement Corridors
Wildlife movement corridors are considered an important ecological resource by various agencies (e.g., USFWS,
USFS, TRPA). In addition, wildlife movement and migration corridors are protected under the TRPA Code of
Ordinances. Movement corridors may provide favorable locations for wildlife to travel between different habitat
areas, such as foraging sites, breeding sites, cover areas, and preferred summer and winter range locations. They
may also function as dispersal corridors that allow animals to move between various locations within their range.
As landscapes become increasingly fragmented, the habitat quality and area of organisms that occupy remaining
patches of suitable habitat may be reduced, and these organisms may become at risk to processes that affect small
or isolated populations (Hilty, Lidicker, and Merenlender 2006:30–48). These processes may include changes in
microclimates, limits to daily or seasonal movements, inbreeding depression, and random demographic or
environmental catastrophes (e.g., wildfire), and can result in increased mortality or local extinction of populations.
Protecting and managing ecological corridors that link core areas of habitat, and that facilitate movement or
dispersal of wildlife among habitat patches, has been widely proposed to reduce the adverse effects of habitat
fragmentation. By maintaining or increasing connectivity among habitat patches or distinct regions, corridors may
play an important role in maintaining population persistence and genetic diversity. Corridors can also facilitate the
recolonization of sites where populations have been extirpated or allow for traditional seasonal movements within
a population’s overall range. Several studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in particular applications (e.g.,
Beier and Noss 1998). The effectiveness of corridors depends in part on the ecology of individual species and the
attributes of the surrounding landscape (Rosenberg, Noon, and Meslow 1997; Hilty, Lidicker, and Merenlender
2006:198–201).
The study area could function as a movement corridor, or as a linkage within a larger movement route, at multiple
spatial scales. At a regional scale, because of its large size, geographic position, and habitat quality, the Upper
Truckee Marsh provides a “stepping stone” or seasonal habitat for waterfowl and shorebirds migrating along the
Pacific Flyway. At a watershed (i.e., across habitats within the Upper Truckee watershed or the Tahoe Basin) or
site (i.e., within the study area) scale, wetland and aquatic habitats in the study area likely facilitate movements of
waterfowl and shorebirds between the Lake Tahoe shoreline and areas higher in the watershed, as well as local
movements within the study area.

Vegetation and Wildlife Resources

Although the study area is one of the most ecologically significant sites in the Tahoe Basin, the extent to which it
functions as a movement corridor, particularly at a watershed or regional scale, for other wildlife species is
unknown. The study area is surrounded on the west, south, and east by roads, residential development, and
commercial activities, and on the north by Lake Tahoe. On its southern boundary, the site is also crossed by U.S. 50.
At a watershed scale, these constraints may limit the study area’s potential value in facilitating wildlife movements,
particularly for medium to large animals (e.g., deer and other mammals). The site could function as a corridor or
stepping stone for species whose movements are less sensitive to the presence of human disturbance and roads, such
as landbirds. For example, for those species, the study area could provide a habitat linkage between the Lake Tahoe
shorezone and areas upstream. Also, because of the study area’s large size, riparian habitats there could facilitate
local dispersal or movements by some riparian or aquatic species within the study area.
The importance of managing the study area as a potential wildlife corridor may increase in the future if upstream
reaches of the Upper Truckee River are restored and habitat functions and values increase there.
Common Migratory Birds
A large number of common bird species are migratory and fall under the jurisdiction of the MBTA. A
comprehensive list of MBTA species that could occur in the study area is too lengthy to provide here, but includes
such familiar species as mountain chickadee, white-breasted nuthatch, yellow-rumped warbler, and several other
warbler species. (Appendix H provides a list of bird species that could occur in the study area.) The nests of all
migratory birds are protected under the MBTA, which makes it illegal to destroy any active migratory bird nest
(see the discussion of the MBTA under the discussion of federal regulations above). Several migratory bird
species have the potential to nest in the study area.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES AND MITIGATION MEASURES

SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA
For this analysis, the following significance criteria were used to identify and analyze the significance of impacts.
CEQA Criteria
Under CEQA, an alternative was determined to result in a significant effect related to vegetation and wildlife
resources if it would:
►

have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or through habitat modification, on any species identified as a
candidate, sensitive, or special-status species in local or regional plans, policies, or regulations, or by CDFG
or USFWS (CEQA 1);

►

have a substantially adverse effect on any riparian habitat or other sensitive natural community identified in
local or regional plans, policies, regulations, or by CDFG and USFWS (CEQA 2);

►

have a substantial adverse effect on federally protected wetlands as defined by Section 404 of the CWA
(including but not limited to marsh, vernal pool, coastal, etc.) through direct removal, filling, hydrological
interruption, or other means (CEQA 3);

►

interfere substantially with the movement of any native resident or migratory wildlife species or established
native resident or migratory wildlife corridors, or impede the use of native wildlife nursery sites (CEQA 4);

►

conflict with any local policies or ordinances protecting biological resources, such as a tree preservation
policy or ordinance (CEQA 5);

Vegetation and Wildlife Resources

3.4-40

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

►

conflict with the provisions of an adopted habitat conservation plan, natural community conservation plan, or
other approved regional, State, or local habitat conservation plan (CEQA 6);

►

conflict with existing zoning for, or cause rezoning of, forest land, timberland, or timberland zoned
Timberland Production (CEQA 7);

►

result in the loss of forest land or conversion of forest land to nonforest use (CEQA 8); or

►

involve other changes in the existing environment which, due to their location or nature, could result in
conversion of forest land to nonforest use (CEQA 9).

These criteria are based on the checklist presented in Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines. For criteria
CEQA 7 and 8, forest land is defined as in Public Resources Code Section 12220(g): land that can support
10 percent native tree cover of any species, including hardwoods, under natural conditions, and that allows for
management of one or more forest resources, including timber, aesthetics, fish and wildlife, biodiversity, water
quality, recreation, and other public benefits.
NEPA Criteria
An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the
environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the proposed action. Under NEPA, the significance
of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account
under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are
encompassed by the CEQA criteria used for this analysis. NEPA requires documentation and discussion of any
beneficial effects of a project in addition to its negative impacts. Where appropriate, these beneficial effects are
discussed and called out specifically for the purposes of NEPA in the following impact analysis.
TRPA Criteria
Based on TRPA’s Initial Environmental Checklist, an alternative was determined to result in a significant impact
related to vegetation and wildlife resources if it would:
►

remove native vegetation in excess of the area utilized for the actual development permitted by TRPA’s land
capability program/Individual Parcel Evaluation System (IPES) (TRPA 1);

►

remove riparian vegetation or other vegetation associated with critical wildlife habitat, through either direct
removal or indirect lowering of the groundwater table (TRPA 2);

►

introduce new vegetation that would require excessive fertilizer or water, or would provide a barrier to the
normal replenishment of existing species (TRPA 3);

►

cause a substantial change in the diversity or distribution of species, or the number of any species of plants
(including trees, shrubs, grass, crops, microflora, and aquatic plants); (this criterion refers to “a substantial
change” rather than just “a change” as in the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist to clarify that this
criterion defines a significant impact rather than just an impact) (TRPA 4);

►

reduce the numbers of any unique, rare, or endangered species of plants (TRPA 5);

►

remove streambank and/or backshore vegetation, including woody vegetation such as willows (TRPA 6);

►

remove any native live, dead, or dying trees 30 inches or greater dbh within TRPA’s Conservation or
Recreation land use classifications (TRPA 7);

Vegetation and Wildlife Resources

►

change the natural functioning of an old-growth ecosystem (TRPA 8);

►

cause a substantial change in the diversity or distribution of species, or the numbers of any species of animals
(birds or land animals including reptiles, insects, mammals, amphibians, or microfauna); (this criterion refers
to “a substantial change” rather than just “a change’ as in the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist to clarify
that this criterion defines a significant impact rather than just an impact) (TRPA 9);

►

reduce the number of any unique, rare, or endangered animal species (TRPA 10);

►

introduce new species of animals into an area, or result in a barrier to the migration or movement of animals
(TRPA 11); or

►

cause the quantity or quality of existing wildlife habitat to deteriorate (TRPA 12).

Although not used as significance criteria, effects on TRPA thresholds were evaluated and these effects are
reported in Section 4.6, “Consequences for Environmental Carrying Capacity Thresholds.”

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
The analysis of the alternatives’ potential effects on vegetation and wildlife resources considers short-term
disturbance; long-term conversion to other cover types; changes in river-floodplain connectivity, hydrology, and
geomorphic processes; and changes in persistent, intermittent disturbance from recreational activities. Areas
potentially affected by short-term disturbance or long-term conversion to other cover types were identified by
overlaying GIS layers of proposed project components (including proposed haul routes and staging areas) on
layers of vegetation (Exhibit 3.4-1), habitat occupied by special-status plants (Exhibit 3.4-2), and bald eagle perch
sites (Exhibit 3.4-3). Acreages of short-term disturbance and long-term conversion of land cover types were
generated through these GIS analyses, and are summarized in Tables 3.4-3 and 3.4-4, respectively. Hydraulic
modeling results presented in the Upper Truckee River and Wetland Restoration Project Final Concept Plan
Report (Conservancy and DGS 2006) were used to evaluate effects on river-floodplain connectivity; in particular,
the area inundated by 2-year streamflow events was considered a general indicator of the area of active floodplain
and river-floodplain connectivity. Evaluation of recreation effects on vegetation and wildlife was based in part on
the location of user-created trails (Exhibit 3.6-2) and of existing and proposed facilities; on land steward
observations (Rozance 2007); and on a presumed slight (Alternative 2) to small (Alternative 1) increase in
recreational use, as described in Section 3.13, “Recreation.” Other relevant existing information (which is
summarized in Section 3.4.2, “Environmental Setting”) and the environmental consequences presented in other
sections of this chapter also were considered in determining effects on vegetation and wildlife resources.
In addition to the methods described above, the evaluation of effects on sensitive communities (SEZs,
jurisdictional wetlands, and riparian vegetation) was based on several important assumptions. First, the
boundaries of SEZs in the study area were considered to roughly correspond to the boundaries of Land Capability
District 1b (Exhibit 3.6-2). This district includes almost the entire study area except for some upland forest,
restored upland shrub, and developed and disturbed areas near the study area’s boundaries. The plant community
boundaries (Exhibit 3.4-1) and the SEZ/land capability district boundaries (Exhibit 3.6-2) were used as an interim
basis for determining the location of potentially jurisdictional wetlands. A formal wetland delineation would be
completed before construction to obtain a USACE permit. Areas mapped as the following vegetation types are
presumed to potentially qualify as jurisdictional wetlands (and to include all riparian vegetation in the study area)
and thus were considered sensitive communities: lodgepole pine forest, willow scrub-wet meadow, montane
meadow, lagoon, and open water. In addition to these vegetation types, beach and dune was also considered a
sensitive habitat. Some of the areas in these habitats are designated as SEZs. A formal wetland delineation
according to USACE criteria will be conducted after selection of a preferred alternative and the footprint of its
constructed elements, to provide impact acreages required for the permitting process.

restored to montane meadow (for applicable alternatives); land associated with the bulkhead and levee would result in restored upland shrub
(90%) and disturbed (10%) cover; and the Alternative 3 river mouth modification would result in montane meadow.

IMPACTS NOT DISCUSSED FURTHER IN THIS EIR/EIS/EIS
Effects related to several CEQA and TRPA significance criteria would not occur, and thus these effects are not
discussed further:
►

Forest Land/Timberland Zoning Conflicts (CEQA 7)—No conflicts with existing zoning or rezoning of
forest land, timberland, or timberland zoned Timberland Production would occur because the study area does
not include any of these zoning designations.

►

New Vegetation (TRPA 3)—No new vegetation would be introduced that required excessive water or
fertilizer, or that provided a barrier to replenishment of existing species.

►

Large Tree Removal (TRPA 7)—No trees greater than 30 inches in diameter would be removed (TRPA 7).

►

Old-Growth Forest (TRPA 8)—No effects related to old-growth forests would occur because no old-growth
forest exists in the study area.

Section 3.4.2, “Environmental Setting,” discusses all special-status plant and wildlife species evaluated in this
analysis, and Tables 3.4-3 and 3.4-4 summarize the potential for each of these species to occur in the study area.
With regard to sensitive species (significance criteria CEQA 1 and TRPA 5), those plant and wildlife species not
expected or with a low probability to occur (because of a lack of suitable habitat, recent focused surveys that did
not detect the species, or lack of other occurrence records) are not addressed further in this analysis.
Implementation of this project is not expected to affect those species.
Potential conflicts with the provisions of an adopted habitat conservation plan, natural community conservation
plan, or other approved regional, State, or local habitat conservation plan (CEQA 6) are evaluated in Section 3.10,
“Land Use.”

IMPACT ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
Alternative 1: Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
IMPACT
3.4-1
(Alt. 1)

Introduction and Spread of Invasive Plants by Construction Activities. (CEQA 2, 3; TRPA 12) Under
Alternative 1, construction activities could introduce or spread nonnative, invasive plant species. Unwashed
construction equipment could carry invasive plant seed or other propagules from infested sites outside of the
study area; seed mixes or soil amendments containing invasive plant seed could be used during revegetation;
soil containing invasive plant seed could be redistributed in the study area; and multiple sites would be
disturbed, providing conditions favorable for invasive plant establishment. However, as described in
Environmental Commitment 4, the Conservancy would implement invasive species management practices to
avoid introducing invasive species during construction. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

Nonnative, invasive plant species displace native plant species and can alter the structure, functions, and
dynamics of aquatic and terrestrial plant communities. As described in Section 3.4.2, “Environmental Setting,”
several invasive plant species are already present in the study area that the Conservancy currently manages (e.g.,
Eurasian watermilfoil and cheatgrass), and other invasive species grow in the Tahoe Basin. (See Section 3.5,
“Fisheries,” for additional discussion of aquatic invasives.) Nonetheless, construction activities could facilitate the
introduction and spread of invasive plants in terrestrial communities of the study area by several mechanisms:

Vegetation and Wildlife Resources

3.4-44

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

►

Introducing invasive plant propagules (i.e., seeds or plant parts capable of establishing a plant) on
unwashed construction equipment entering the study area from infested sites. Under Alternative 1,
multiple trucks and other construction machinery would repeatedly enter the study area for four years
(Table 2-4). This equipment might enter the study area following use at sites infested with invasive plants and
might be carrying invasive plant propagules (e.g., in mud attached to tread).

►

Introducing invasive plant materials by using seed mixes or soil amendments (e.g., compost) containing
invasive plant propagules. Although soil would not be brought into the study area to construct Alternative 1,
seed mixes and soil amendments containing propagules of invasive plants could be used during revegetation.

►

Spreading terrestrial invasive plants already present in the study area by redistributing soil containing
invasive plant propagules. Under Alternative 1, soil would be stockpiled and reapplied or otherwise
redistributed on acres of land. For example, as reported in Table 3.4-3, approximately 14 acres of terrestrial
natural vegetation would be disturbed for the short term. This redistribution of soil could also spread
propagules of invasive plants that are already present in the study area.

Facilitating the introduction and spread of invasive plants by creating disturbed sites. Disturbed sites
provide an opportunity for additional species of plants to establish on a site, particularly “weedy” species,
which include a number of invasive species. Approximately 23 acres of disturbed sites would be created
under Alternative 1, and these sites would provide an opportunity for invasive plants to establish and spread.

Through one or more of these mechanisms, it is possible that one or more invasive plant species could be
introduced or spread by construction activities under Alternative 1. However, as described in Environmental
Commitment (EC) 4, “Prepare and Implement an Invasive Species Management Plan” (Table 2-6), the
Conservancy would implement invasive plant management practices during project construction. The following
practices would be included:
►

A qualified biologist with experience in the Tahoe Basin will conduct a preconstruction survey to determine
whether any populations of invasive plants are present in the project area. If invasive species are documented,
they will be removed or their spread otherwise prevented before the start of construction. Control measures
may include herbicide application, hand removal, or other mechanical control.

►

All equipment entering the study area from areas infested by invasive plants or areas of unknown infestation
status will be cleaned of all attached soil or plant parts before being allowed into the study area.

►

To reduce the need for importing seed or other materials potentially containing invasive plants, the project
will use on-site sources of seed and materials to the extent practicable. Seed, soil amendment, and erosion
control materials that need to be imported to the study area will be certified weed free or will be obtained
from a site documented as uninfested by invasive plants.

►

After project construction, the project site will be annually monitored for infestations of invasive plants for 4
years. If infestations of invasive plants are documented during monitoring, they will be treated and eradicated
to prevent further spread.

By reducing or eliminating the primary vectors for introduction of invasive plant seed, and eliminating
infestations that establish, implementation of EC 4, described above, would substantially reduce the likelihood of
the inadvertent introduction and spread of invasive plants as a result of construction activities. Therefore, this
impact would be less than significant.

3.4-2
(Alt. 1)

Introduction and Spread of Invasive Plants by Recreational Activities. (CEQA 2, 3; TRPA 12) Under
Alternative 1, it is expected there would be an increase in the number of visitors to the study area, and these
visitors could contribute to the introduction and spread of invasive plants by dispersing these plants and
disturbing habitat. However, there would also be a reduction in habitat disturbance because existing usercreated trails would be removed from the core habitat area and habitat protection measures (e.g., signs and
railings) would be incorporated into recreation infrastructure to reduce habitat disturbance by visitors. However,
Alternative 1 would increase access to other areas by the construction of boardwalks, bridges, and bike trails,
which would increase visitor access at the north end of the study area. Because visitor access and associated
recreational activities would be redistributed through implementation of Alternative 1, it is expected that the
contribution of such activities to the spread of invasive weeds would remain similar to the existing contribution.
This impact would be less than significant.

Recreational users can disperse invasive plants from infested sites into the study area and can disturb vegetation,
which facilitates establishment of invasive plants. Currently, visitors and their pets use an extensive network of
user-created trails in most habitats of the study area, including the core habitat area. Visitors also enter habitats
from along the Upper Truckee River and the shoreline of Lake Tahoe. In all these areas, visitors disperse invasive
plants and disturb vegetation (which facilitates the establishment of invasive plants). Implementing Alternative 1
would remove these user-created trails from the core habitat area, which would reduce the disturbance of
vegetation and potential dispersal of invasive plants in those areas. However, Alternative 1 would increase
recreational access to the mouth of the Upper Truckee River and the shoreline of Lake Tahoe within the study
area because of the construction of boardwalks, bridges, and bike trails. These facilities would be designed to also
provide some habitat protection (e.g., signage and designated facilities designed to discourage use of sensitive
areas). Therefore, although implementing Alternative 1 would likely result in a small increase in visitors to a
small portion of the study area (adjacent to boardwalks, bridges, and bike trails), there would be a decrease in
access through a large portion of the study area (resulting from removal of user-created trails). Habitat protection
features incorporated into the new recreation facilities would reduce disturbance in those areas, and the
introduction and spread of invasive species would be reduced where trails and access are removed from the core
habitat. Because visitor access and associated recreational activities would be redistributed through
implementation of Alternative 1, it is expected that the contribution of such activities to the spread of invasive
weeds would remain similar to the existing contribution. This impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.4-3
(Alt. 1)

Damage to or Mortality of Special-Status Plants Resulting from Construction Activities.
(CEQA 1, 5; TRPA 5) Under Alternative 1, construction activities would not occur in occupied
American mannagrass habitat. However, construction of the bridge and boardwalk would
occur in and close to Tahoe yellow cress habitat that could be occupied. Thus, construction of
these facilities could damage or kill Tahoe yellow cress plants. This impact would be
potentially significant.

Two special-status plant species were documented in the study area by the protocol-level plant survey: American
mannagrass and TYC. Alternative 1 would not involve construction activities in the area along Trout Creek
occupied by American mannagrass. Thus, American mannagrass would not be affected by Alternative 1.
However, a bridge and boardwalk would be constructed along the study area’s Lake Tahoe shoreline under this
alternative, and construction would also occur along the shoreline where the mouth of the Upper Truckee River
would be modified. Footings for the bridge would be placed in beach and dune habitat where TYC is known to
occur, and portions of the boardwalk would be located near beach and dune habitat where TYC is known to occur
or could potentially be present. Similarly, river mouth modifications also would require construction activities and
associated disturbance of beach and dune habitat. Therefore, construction of this bridge and boardwalk, and river
mouth modification, could damage or kill TYC plants. This impact would be potentially significant.

Mitigation Measure 3.4-3 (Alt. 1): Conduct Protocol-Level Preconstruction Surveys and Avoid or Mitigate Impacts on
Tahoe Yellow Cress Plants.
To avoid or mitigate potential adverse effects on Tahoe yellow cress (TYC) plants (stems) resulting from
construction activities, the following actions will be implemented:
(A) A qualified botanical monitor familiar with the vegetation of the Tahoe Basin and identification of TYC will
conduct a focused preconstruction survey for TYC in all beach habitat where construction-related ground
disturbance could occur during that year. Surveys will be conducted between June 15 and September 30,
when TYC is clearly identifiable, and will follow CDFG’s Protocols for Surveying and Evaluating Impacts to
Special Status Plant Populations and Natural Communities (CDFG 2009). Surveys will be completed for
each year that construction activities could occur in beach habitat.
If no TYC stems are found during the survey, the results of the survey will be documented in a letter report to
the Conservancy and TYC Adaptive Management Working Group (AMWG) that will become part of the
project environmental record, and no further actions will be required.
(B) If TYC stems are documented during the survey in areas potentially disturbed by construction activities, they
will be clearly identified in the field, and if feasible, protected from impacts associated with construction
activities. Protective measures will include flagging and fencing of known stem locations and avoidance. If
feasible, no construction-related activities will be allowed in areas fenced for avoidance, and construction
personnel will be briefed about the presence of the stems and the need to avoid effects on the stems. If all
TYC stems are avoided, no further actions will be required.
(C) If avoidance of all TYC plants is not feasible, the Conservancy, in coordination with the TYC AMWG, will
delineate and fence a mitigation area within the study area, excavate and translocate potentially affected
stems, plant additional nursery-grown TYC plants, and monitor and adaptively manage the mitigation area, as
described below. The mitigation area will extend from the inland edge of suitable habitat to the location on
the edge of Lake Tahoe under the lowest possible lake elevation. If deemed necessary during monitoring, the
Conservancy will either relocate or enlarge the mitigation area to achieve mitigation goals.
All potentially affected stems will be excavated and translocated to the mitigation area. Translocation will
follow, as closely as possible, protocols that have been shown to be effective and described by Stanton and
Pavlik (2009), and all translocated stems will be marked and/or mapped to facilitate monitoring.
Translocation will be limited to no more than 10 percent of the suitable habitat within the project area. If
project activities would impact more than 10 percent of the suitable habitat, then design or construction
techniques will be adjusted to ensure no more than 10 percent of the suitable habitat would be affected by
translocation.
Additional outplanting of container-grown nursery TYC plants to the mitigation area will also occur.
Outplanting will occur at a rate of two plants for every one transplanted stem, for a total mitigation rate of 3:1,
for combined translocated stems and outplanted container-grown plants. Outplanting of container-grown
plants will follow, as closely as possible, protocols that have been shown to be effective as described by
Stanton and Pavlik (2009), and all outplanted plants will be marked and/or mapped to facilitate monitoring.
Tahoe yellow cress stem translocation and outplanting of container-grown plants will be followed by active
monitoring and adaptive management for the remainder of the growing season in which translocation and
outplanting occurs, and the following two growing seasons. Monitoring and adaptive management will
include the following actions:
(1) For the remainder of the growing season in which stem translocation and outplanting or container-grown
plants occurs, a qualified botanical monitor familiar with the identification of TYC shall inspect each
translocated or outplanted stem at least once per month and record phenology (i.e., life cycle stage) and

condition. The Conservancy will consult with the AMWG concerning appropriate measures if significant
mortality or vandalism is observed. Additional outplanting will depend on the timing of the observed
mortality and the level of the lake.
(2) For the two growing seasons following the season in which stem translocation and container-grown plant
outplanting occurred, success of mitigation efforts will be evaluated based on the ratio of TYC stems
occurring within the mitigation area. Immediately following translocation and outplanting activities, a
qualified botanical monitor shall conduct a complete inventory of TYC stems in the mitigation area.
During each of the two growing seasons following the season in which translocation and outplanting
occurs, a qualified botanical monitor shall conduct a complete inventory of the number of TYC stems
present in the mitigation area. Surveys will be conducted when TYC is clearly identifiable. If the ratio of
stems in the mitigation area is less than the ratio recorded immediately following translocation and
outplanting activities, then the Conservancy will conduct additional outplanting of container-grown TYC
plants to achieve at least the same ratio of TYC stems in the mitigation area. If deemed necessary based
on monitoring results, the Conservancy will either relocate or enlarge the mitigation area to achieve
mitigation goals.
The TYC AMWG and CDFG are continuing to develop a standardized monitoring protocol for TYC. Therefore,
in an effort to be consistent with the developed protocol, before project implementation, the Conservancy will
coordinate with the TYC AMWG and CDFG to finalize the monitoring protocol for evaluating mitigation efforts.
Significance after Mitigation: With implementation of the measures described above, TYC plants that are
present in areas of potential ground disturbance would be identified before construction, and impacts on those
plants would be avoided if feasible. If avoidance is not feasible, affected TYC plants would be mitigated at a rate
of 3:1, and active monitoring and adaptive management would ensure the success of mitigation actions.
Therefore, with implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.4-3 (Alt. 1), Impact 3.4-3 (Alt. 1) would be less than
significant.
IMPACT
3.4-4
(Alt. 1)

Altered Extent of Special-Status Plant Habitat. (CEQA 1, TRPA 5) Under Alternative 1, lagoon restoration
could increase the extent of habitat that may be physically suitable for American mannagrass. Also, the
increased extent and inundation of willow scrub-wet meadow under this alternative could increase the extent of
habitat suitable for American mannagrass. However, both of these effects are uncertain and may not alter the
extent of suitable habitat. Under Alternative 1, beach and dune restoration could increase the extent of habitat
physically suitable for Tahoe yellow cress. The boardwalk would be located near the back beach-marsh
transition, but as described in Chapter 2, in the final design it would be sited in the marsh outside of Tahoe
yellow cress habitat. Potential changes in sediment supply would not be sufficient to substantially reduce areas
physically suitable for Tahoe yellow cress. In summary, the effect on the extent of habitat for American
mannagrass would be no effect to beneficial, and for Tahoe yellow cress, the effect would be less than
significant. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

There are two special-status plant species documented in the study area: American mannagrass and TYC. The
effect of implementing Alternative 1 could be an increase in the extent of habitat that may be physically suitable
for American mannagrass, but could be a reduction in the extent of habitat that may be physically suitable for
TYC. It would provide additional habitat potentially suitable for American mannagrass by restoring the lagoon
behind East Barton Beach (Table 3.4-4). Also, the extent of habitat suitable for American mannagrass could be
increased by the additional acreage of willow scrub-wet meadow and more frequent overbanking of river flow
into the marsh that would result from the river restoration included in Alternative 1. However, the specific
microhabitat requirements of American mannagrass (e.g., mud benches along Trout Creek) are not known and
thus river restoration may not increase the extent of this species.

Implementing Alternative 1 also would increase the acreage of beach and dune (Table 3.4-4) by restoring beach
and dune at Cove East Beach, which could provide additional habitat suitable for TYC. However, most beach and
dune that would be restored is up to several hundred feet from the immediate shoreline and may not include the
moist microsites that provide habitat for TYC. In contrast, the boardwalk proposed under Alternative 1 would be
located adjacent to the beach, and thus, could cause the loss of some occupied habitat. As described in Chapter 2,
during final design, the alternative would avoid TYC habitat by locating the bridge and boardwalk in marsh not
back beach habitat. The river restoration included in Alternative 1 would not alter the function of the beach but
could affect the extent of beach habitat by altering the sediment supply from the Upper Truckee River to beaches
in the study area. This potential effect would not be substantial and is evaluated in Section 3.9, “Geomorphology
and Water Quality.”
Although recreational use of potential habitat for TYC habitat would be increased because of boardwalk, bridge,
and bike trail construction, disturbance associated with this recreational use would not alter conditions sufficiently
to make habitat no longer physically suitable for TYC. However, increased recreational use would increase
damage and death of TYC plants from trampling, which is addressed separately by Impact 3.4-5.
The effect of Alternative 1 on the function and extent of habitat for American mannagrass would be no effect to
beneficial and on the function and extent of habitat for TYC would be less than significant. Thus, this impact
would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.4-5
(Alt. 1)

Damage to or Mortality of Special-Status Plants Resulting from Recreational Activities. (CEQA 1, 5;
TRPA 5) Under Alternative 1, damage to or mortality of special-status plants resulting from recreational
activities would increase. Under existing conditions, habitat occupied by American mannagrass is in a location
that is not substantially disturbed by recreational activities, and implementing Alternative 1 would maintain this
condition. Under Alternative 1, the existing Tahoe yellow cress management plan (including the Barton Beach
exclosure and adaptive management) would continue to be implemented. However, Alternative 1 would
construct a boardwalk in close proximity to habitat occupied by Tahoe yellow cress and increase recreational
use of potential and occupied habitat, and thus, would likely increase trampling of Tahoe yellow cress plants.
Therefore, this impact would be significant.

Implementing Alternative 1 could change recreational activity in habitat suitable for the two special-status plant
species documented in the study area: American mannagrass and TYC.
American mannagrass grows along Trout Creek in an area that is not disturbed by recreational activities under
existing conditions and that is not likely to be disturbed in the future. Under Alternative 1, this area would be
included in the core habitat in which recreational use would be reduced; therefore, there would be no substantial
effect on American mannagrass.
Tahoe yellow cress grows in beach and dune habitat along the study area’s Lake Tahoe shoreline at Cove East
Beach and Barton Beach. Under existing conditions, this shoreline is used for recreation, and some TYC plants
are damaged or killed by visitors. For the study area, the Conservancy has implemented a TYC management plan
(Conservancy 2008) that incorporates applicable actions of the regional, multi-agency, conservation strategy for
TYC (Conservation Strategy for Tahoe yellow Cress [Rorippa subumbellata] [Pavlik, Murphy, and TYCTAG
2002]). These actions include establishing and maintaining an exclosure to protect most occupied habitat at
Barton Beach and monitoring and adaptive management.
Recreational use of Cove East Beach would not be substantially altered by implementation of Alternative 1.
However, recreational use of Barton Beach would increase because Alternative 1 involves constructing a bridge
over the Upper Truckee River and a boardwalk trail just inland from Barton Beach that would increase access.
Railings, other design features of the boardwalk, and signage would discourage disturbance of beach and dune
habitat. and an exclosure would continue to protect most TYC plants from damage or mortality. However,
because the boardwalk would be constructed close to the existing populations and an increase in visitors is

expected. A subsequent increase in trampling of plants and other disturbance to TYC populations is also expected,
despite signage, protective measures, and continued implementation of the TYC management plan.
This impact would be significant.
All feasible measures to avoid, minimize, or mitigate this impact have already been incorporated into the design
of Alternative 1 and the existing TYC management plan. However, these measures would not be sufficient to
fully mitigate the effects of increased trampling of TYC resulting from increased access to Barton Beach. For this
reason, this impact would be significant and unavoidable.
IMPACT

(Alt. 1)

Short-Term Disturbance of Sensitive Communities (Jurisdictional Wetlands, Riparian Vegetation, and
SEZ) Resulting from Construction Activities. (CEQA 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2, 4, 6) Implementing Alternative 1
would disturb sensitive communities. This disturbance would be short term. As described in Environmental
Commitments 5 and 6, the Conservancy would minimize the risk to water quality and vegetation and comply
with the terms and conditions of required permits to reduce this disturbance. Nonetheless, approximately 16
acres of sensitive communities would be disturbed. This impact would be significant.

In the study area, as described above in “Methods and Assumptions,” part or all of areas mapped as open water,
lagoon, willow scrub-wet meadow, montane meadow, or lodgepole pine forest potentially qualify as jurisdictional
wetlands or are considered riparian vegetation or an SEZ. Thus, these areas are all considered sensitive
communities. Beach and dune is also a sensitive community.
Constructing the restoration, habitat protection, public access, and recreation components of Alternative 1 would
disturb approximately 16 acres of these sensitive communities (Table 3.4-3). Short-term disturbance of sensitive
communities can adversely affect ecosystem functions and the services that are products of these functions,
including sediment retention and the provision of habitat for common and sensitive plant and wildlife species.
With implementation of EC 5, “Prepare and Implement Effective Construction Site Management Plans to
Minimize Risks of Water Quality Degradation and Impacts to Vegetation,” and EC 6, “Obtain and Comply with
Federal, State, Regional, and Local Permits,” described in Table 2-6 in Chapter 2, this impact would be reduced,
but the short-term disturbance of sensitive communities would not be eliminated because such disturbance is
integral to the river, floodplain, and other restoration elements of Alternative 1. This impact would be significant.
Beyond what is already proposed as environmental commitments as part of the project, no feasible mitigation is
available to address this impact. Therefore, this impact would be significant and unavoidable.
IMPACT
3.4-7
(Alt. 1)

Enhancement and Creation of Sensitive Communities (Jurisdictional Wetlands, Riparian Vegetation,
and SEZs) Resulting from River and Floodplain Restoration. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 1 would
convert some disturbed, developed, and restored upland shrub to sensitive communities. The combined
increase in extent of sensitive communities would be approximately 10 acres. In addition, sensitive
communities would be enhanced by increasing overbank flooding. Because the extent of sensitive communities
would be increased and the existing sensitive communities would be enhanced, this effect would be beneficial.

In the study area, sensitive communities include jurisdictional wetlands, riparian vegetation, and SEZ. These
communities correspond to the open water, lagoon, willow scrub-wet meadow, montane meadow, lodgepole pine
forest, and beach and dune cover types mapped for the study area (Exhibit 3.4-1). Alternative 1 would involve
converting some disturbed, developed, and restored upland shrub to sensitive communities (Table 3.4-4). The
combined increase in extent of sensitive communities would be approximately 10 acres, with willow scrub-wet
meadow increasing in acreage more than other sensitive communities and lodgepole pine forest decreasing more
than other sensitive communities. Because there is a broad overlap in the ecological functions and services
provided by these sensitive communities, the effects of a decrease in the acreage of one community are largely

offset by increases in other sensitive communities. For example, many wildlife and plant species use more than
one of these sensitive communities as habitat (Appendices G and H). SEZ preservation and restoration is an
important component of the condition of Lake Tahoe, because SEZs remove some nutrients and sediment from
runoff. SEZs also include sensitive communities that provide many other benefits, but they currently only
compose only five percent of the land area within the Tahoe Basin (State Parks et al. 2011). Implementing
Alternative 1 would increase and enhance SEZs within the study area. Additional long-term beneficial effects are
discussed for Impacts 3.4-4 and 3.4-8, and in Section 3.9, “Geomorphology and Water Quality.” Because river
and floodplain restoration under Alternative 1 would increase the combined extent of sensitive communities and
enhance the functions and services provided by them, this long-term effect would be beneficial.

Disruption of Wildlife Habitat Use and Loss of Wildlife Resulting from Construction Activities. (CEQA
1; TRPA 9, 10, 12) Under Alternative 1, construction activities could cause short-term disruption of wildlife use
of the study area, cause the loss of wildlife, or both. Wintering bald eagle use of the study area does not occur
during the construction season and thus would not be disrupted. However, construction of the restoration
elements and recreation infrastructure of Alternative 1 could result in the harm or loss of individuals or nests or
result in substantial disruptions to nesting attempts or other activities by three special-status bird species
(yellow warbler, willow flycatcher, and long-eared owl) and would substantially affect nesting or other activities
by one special-status guild (waterfowl). It also could result in abandonment or removal of active roost sites for,
or harm or loss of, hoary bat or western red bat. A number of common wildlife species also would likely have
their use of the study area disrupted. This impact would be significant.

Under Alternative 1, construction activities could cause short-term disruption of wildlife use of portions of the
study area, cause the loss of wildlife, or both. Construction activities would affect both common and special-status
wildlife species by the same mechanisms: (1) human disturbance (i.e., the sounds and motions of construction
workers and machinery) that disrupts foraging, nesting attempts, or other wildlife use of the study area and
concurrently causes physiological stress, energetic costs, and increased risk of predation and (2) damage and
removal of vegetation by clearing and grubbing, stockpiling of materials and soil, off-road operation of vehicles
and other machinery, and earthwork that destroys nests or roost sites or harms or kills wildlife.
Fifteen special-status wildlife taxa/guilds either have been documented in the study area or have a moderate to
high likelihood of being present (Table 3.4-2). Some of these species are wide-ranging raptors that may forage or
perch in the study area but that are unlikely to nest in the study area (including osprey, bald eagle, and northern
goshawk); these species would not be substantially affected by construction activities, and construction activities
might even benefit some foraging activities. Wintering bald eagles that perch in the study area would not be
affected because their use of the study area would not be during the construction season. Construction activities
could disturb the foraging activities of raptors, particularly where these activities would occur near the Upper
Truckee River. However, because existing recreation use is already a source of disturbance, additional
construction-related disturbance might not substantially affect foraging patterns. Furthermore, abundant foraging
habitat is available in other areas nearby. Construction activities associated with Alternative 1 also would not
cause injury or mortality to individuals. Therefore, construction activities would not be sufficient to affect the
population size or viability of these species.
However, the nesting or roosting of six special-status taxa/guilds in the study area could be adversely affected by
the human disturbance or by the damage and removal of vegetation associated with construction:
►

Yellow warbler and willow flycatcher. The yellow warbler and willow flycatcher are special-status birds
associated with riparian, wetland, and aquatic habitats. They potentially could nest in the study area during
construction of Alternative 1. The yellow warbler has been documented nesting in willow scrub in the study
area as recently as 2004 (Borgmann and Morrison 2004). The willow flycatcher also nests in riparian
vegetation and historically nested in the study area (Orr and Moffitt 1971). Protocol surveys for willow
flycatcher conducted by AECOM biologists in 2011 located two male willow flycatchers within the study

area, but no evidence of nesting; however, willow flycatchers still nest in the watershed of the Upper Truckee
River several miles upstream.
►

►

►

Waterfowl. As described in Section 3.4.2, “Environmental Setting,” several species of waterfowl likely nest
in the study area in dense herbaceous vegetation near the open water of lagoons or river channels.
Long-eared owl. As described in Section 3.4.2, “Environmental Setting,” there is uncertainty regarding the
nesting requirements of long-eared owl. The species occurs in the Tahoe Basin and has been observed in the
Upper Truckee watershed (Fields, pers. comm., 2007), but its breeding status in the area is unknown. Longeared owl could nest in Jeffrey pine forest, lodgepole pine forest, or willow scrub-wet meadow in the study
area.
Western red bat and hoary bat. For both of these bat species, suitable roosting habitat exists in trees along
forest edges bordering open habitats and in trees in riparian corridors of the study area, and high-quality
foraging habitat is present throughout the study area. Western red bats have been detected at Tallac Marsh,
less than four miles west of the study area (Borgmann and Morrison 2004). Hoary bats have been documented
in the study area as recently as 2004 (Borgmann and Morrison 2004).

Construction of Alternative 1 would involve disturbance and removal of vegetation (including willow thickets and
trees) from willow scrub-wet meadow, Jeffrey pine forest, and lodgepole pine forest that provides suitable nesting
habitat for yellow warbler, potentially suitable nesting habitat for willow flycatcher and long-eared owl, and
suitable roosting habitat for western red bat and hoary bat. Construction would also disturb and remove dense
herbaceous vegetation near the open water of lagoons and the Upper Truckee River that provides nesting habitat
for waterfowl. Furthermore, construction activities would generate human disturbance (e.g., noise) near these
nesting and roosting habitats.
Removing or disturbing occupied nesting habitat would result in a substantial effect on the yellow warbler, willow
flycatcher, long-eared owl, or waterfowl if individuals were killed, otherwise harmed, deterred from occupying
breeding and nesting locations, or caused to abandoned a nest (potentially resulting in mortality of eggs and
chicks). Similarly, roost removal or disturbance causing roost abandonment would have a substantial effect on
either bat species, particularly if individuals were killed or otherwise harmed. In addition, use of the study area by
a number of common wildlife species would likely be disrupted. Therefore, the effect of construction activities on
wildlife use of the study area would be significant.
Mitigation Measure 3.4-8A (Alt. 1): Conduct Preconstruction Surveys for Nesting Special-Status Birds (Yellow
Warbler, Willow Flycatcher, Waterfowl, and Long-Eared Owl), and Implement Buffers If Necessary.
For construction activities that would occur in suitable habitat during the nesting season (April 1 through August
31), a qualified wildlife biologist will conduct focused surveys for active nest sites of the yellow warbler, willow
flycatcher, waterfowl, and long-eared owl. The biologist will be able to identify Sierra Nevada bird species
audibly and visually. The conduct of these surveys will conform to the following guidelines:
►

Yellow warbler, waterfowl, and long-eared owl. Focused surveys for yellow warbler, waterfowl, and longeared owl nests will be conducted by a qualified wildlife biologist within 14 days before construction
activities are initiated each construction season. The preconstruction survey for yellow warbler, waterfowl,
and long-eared owl nests will be conducted using a nest-searching technique appropriate for the species. For
yellow warbler, an appropriate technique will involve first conducting point counts in suitable riparian habitat
to determine occupancy, followed by nest searching if the species is present. For long-eared owl, surveys will
involve tape playbacks of recorded long-eared owl calls.

►

Willow Flycatcher. For construction activities initiated in suitable breeding habitat for the willow flycatcher
after May 31, a preconstruction survey for nesting willow flycatchers will be conducted each construction
season. The survey will follow A Willow Flycatcher Survey Protocol for California (Bombay et al. 2003).

The protocol requires a minimum of two survey visits to determine presence or absence of the willow
flycatcher: one visit during survey period 2 (June 15–25) and one during either survey period 1 (June 1–14) or
period 3 (June 26–July 15).
If active yellow warbler, willow flycatcher, or long-eared owl nests are located during the preconstruction
surveys, the biologist will notify TRPA and CDFG. If a yellow warbler or willow flycatcher nest is located,
construction will be avoided within 500 feet of the nest (or at a distance directed by CDFG) to avoid disturbance
until the nest is no longer active based on monitoring. If an active long-eared owl nest is located, construction
within 0.25 mile of the nest site (or at a distance directed by CDFG) will be delayed until the nest is no longer active
based on monitoring.
If active waterfowl nests are located during preconstruction surveys, the biologist will notify TRPA, and to the
extent feasible, construction will be avoided within 500 feet of active nests.
Mitigation Measure 3.4-8B (Alt. 1): Conduct Preconstruction Surveys for Special-Status Bats, Avoid Removal of
Important Roosts, and Implement a Limited Operating Period If Necessary.
Bat surveys will be conducted by a qualified wildlife biologist within 14 days before any tree removal or clearing
each construction season. Locations of vegetation and tree removal or excavation will be examined for potential
bat roosts. Potential roost sites identified will be monitored on two separate occasions for bat activity, using bat
detectors to help identify species. Monitoring will begin 30 minutes before sunset and will last up to two hours at
any potential roost identified. Removal of any significant roost locations discovered will be avoided to the extent
feasible. If avoidance is not feasible, roost sites will not be disturbed by project activities until September 1 or
later, when juveniles at maternity roosts are able to fly.
Significance after Mitigation: With the measures above, the loss of individuals, nests, or roost sites of specialstatus wildlife species during construction would be substantially reduced. However, because waterfowl likely
nest near the river mouth, Sailing Lagoon, Trout Creek Lagoon, and elsewhere within the study area,
implementing buffers or a limited operating period that would avoid substantial effects on waterfowl nesting
would not be feasible. Therefore, with implementation of Mitigation Measures 3.4-8A (Alt. 1) and 3.4-8B
(Alt. 1), Impact 3.4-8 (Alt. 1) would be significant and unavoidable.
IMPACT
3.4-9
(Alt. 1)

Altered Extent and Quality of Wildlife Habitats Resulting from River, Floodplain, and Other Restoration
and Enhancement Elements. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 1 would increase the extent of lagoon, willow
scrub-wet meadow, and beach and dune habitats; and enhance the habitat quality of willow scrub-wet
meadow, lagoon, and other floodplain habitats by increasing hydrologic connectivity of the river and its
floodplain. This effect would be beneficial.

Implementing Alternative 1 would alter the extent and quality of wildlife habitats through restoration that would
create additional willow scrub-wet meadow, beach and dune, and lagoon habitat (Table 3.4-4). Most of this
increase would result from the conversion of restored upland, disturbed, and developed areas, but smaller amounts
of forest and channel would also be converted. The creation of additional habitat would benefit wildlife by
providing more habitat and by increasing the size and connectivity of habitat patches.
Implementing Alternative 1 would also enhance the quality of floodplain habitats by restoring a sinuous channel
and an active floodplain, which would increase overbank flooding, deposition of sediment on floodplains, and
periodic disturbance of vegetation by floodwaters. For example, the two-year streamflow event would inundate
approximately 18 percent more area under Alternative 1 than under existing conditions (Conservancy and DGS
2006:A1). These enhanced processes would increase heterogeneity of habitat features and conditions, provide
more opportunities for vegetation establishment, and increase productivity of floodplain and riparian vegetation
relative to existing and future no-project/no-action conditions.

In summary, Alternative 1 would increase the extent of lagoon, willow scrub-wet meadow, and beach and dune
habitats; and enhance the habitat functions of willow scrub-wet meadow, lagoon, and other floodplain habitats by
increasing hydrologic connectivity of the river and its floodplain. The long-term effect on wildlife habitats would
be beneficial.
IMPACT

(Alt. 1)

Altered Quality of Wildlife Habitats Resulting from Altered Recreational Use. (CEQA 1; NEPA; TRPA 9,
10, 12) Implementing Alternative 1 would improve the quality of wildlife habitat in much of the study area by
removing user-created trails from a core habitat area and by providing habitat protection features that would
discourage recreational use of sensitive habitat areas. However, implementing Alternative 1 would increase
disturbance of wildlife habitat in a small portion of the study area by increasing access in the vicinity of
proposed boardwalks, bridges, and bike trail. This impact would be less than significant.

Alternative 1 would involve removing and restoring to habitat the extensive network of user-created trails in a
central, 308-acre portion of the study area (i.e., the designated core habitat) and in almost eight acres of forest
adjacent to the Highland Woods subdivision. Outside of the core habitat, public access features would be
constructed that would also discourage use of the core habitat, and signage would inform visitors of habitat
values, and encourage a resource stewardship ethic. Recreational use and the associated disruption of wildlife use
would not be reduced in all sensitive habitats, however. Some of the public access facilities (boardwalks, bridges,
and bike trails) are expected to increase the number of visitors to the study area, thereby increasing the disruption
of wildlife use outside of the designated core area (e.g., nesting by yellow warblers and waterfowl). In the Cove
East Beach area, recreational use would remain similar to or slightly greater than the existing level of use.
Wintering bald eagle perching in this area would not be disrupted because these perches already exist with
recreational use of the area and because winter recreational use is unlikely to change considerably under
Alternative 1. Because the bridge and boardwalk components of Alternative 1 would improve access, recreational
use of Barton Beach is expected to increase. Despite signage and design features that would discourage visitors
from entering habitat near the boardwalk, there would be an increased human presence. Consequently, some
wildlife use, particularly waterfowl nesting, could be reduced or disrupted or both in the area adjacent to the
boardwalk, which includes lagoon habitat. However, in a much larger portion of the study area, the presence of
humans and disruption of wildlife use, including waterfowl nesting, would be reduced.
In summary, implementing Alternative 1 would increase the quality of wildlife habitat in much of the study area
by removing user-created trails from a core habitat area and by providing public access and habitat protection
features that would direct recreational use away from most sensitive habitat areas. However, in habitats in the
vicinity of Barton Beach, human disturbance of wildlife could increase. Overall, this long-term impact would be
less than significant.
IMPACT

(Alt. 1)

Conversion of Forest Land to Nonforest Use. (CEQA 8, 9; TRPA 4, 5) Implementing the restoration
elements of Alternative 1 would convert approximately 0.1 acre of Jeffrey pine forest and 1.1 acres of
lodgepole pine forest to natural vegetation types that are dominated by shrubs or herbaceous plants. This
would be long-term, but not permanent conversion. This conversion would allow continued management for
resource values including recreation, biodiversity, aesthetics, and water quality. In addition, river and
floodplain restoration would enhance habitat values of the remaining forest land. Because the area of forest
land conversion would be small, not permanent, allow for continued management of most resource values
provided by the existing forest land, and enhance the resource values of remaining forest, this impact would
be less than significant.

Implementing the restoration elements of Alternative 1 would convert approximately 0.1 acre of Jeffrey pine
forest and 1.1 acres of lodgepole pine forest to natural vegetation types that are dominated by shrubs or
herbaceous plants. This would be long-term but not permanent conversion: it would allow for the land to support
greater than ten percent tree cover in the future through natural succession (e.g., through encroachment of
meadow and willow scrub by lodgepole pine). This conversion would also allow continued management for

resources including recreation, biodiversity, aesthetics, and water quality. In addition, river and floodplain
restoration would enhance biodiversity values of the remaining forest land, because many forest species also use
the willow scrub-wet meadow and other habitats that would be restored or enhanced (Appendix H), and because
the reduction in human disturbance of wildlife that would result from habitat protection and enhancement
elements of Alternative 1. Because the area of forest land conversion would be small, allow for continued
management of most resource values provided by the existing forest land, and enhance the resource values of
remaining forest, this impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.4-12
(Alt. 1)

Interference with Wildlife Use of Established Movement Corridors. (CEQA 4, TRPA 11) The study area
may function as a corridor for wildlife movement between the Lake Tahoe shorezone and riparian areas
upstream. Implementing Alternative 1 would result in short-term disturbance that could interfere with wildlife
use of this corridor. However, construction-related disturbance would be restricted daily and seasonally, and
disturbance to vegetation would affect only a small portion of the study area temporarily. Furthermore, as
described in Environmental Commitments 5 and 6, the Conservancy would minimize vegetation disturbance
and revegetate. Therefore, wildlife movement would not be blocked and the effect on wildlife movement
would not be substantial. This impact would be less than significant.

Although no regionally significant wildlife movement corridors have been confirmed to occupy the study area, its
large size and location make it potentially suitable for localized wildlife movement. Furthermore, the Upper
Truckee River’s riparian corridor likely functions as a potentially important wildlife movement corridor.
Depending on their setting, quality, and physical connectivity to other habitats, stream corridors are often used by
wildlife as movement corridors in many landscapes; the Upper Truckee River likely serves this function. The
Upper Truckee River’s riparian corridor is a well-defined linear landscape feature that provides unique
biophysical conditions, traverses a variety of ecotones, and connects upstream and downstream areas within the
watershed; however, it is degraded in its current condition within the study area because of historic channel
straightening and ongoing incision and disconnection from its floodplain. As discussed previously, the increased
area and improved ecosystem functions of SEZ, floodplain, and wetland communities along the Upper Truckee
River under Alternative 1 would benefit wildlife communities locally; these benefits would improve the SEZ’s
corridor function by increasing habitat quality in the core habitat area and removing user-created trails, therefore,
increasing the corridor width.
Recreation infrastructure proposed under Alternative 1 would be located primarily outside of the riparian corridor
area and adjacent to areas of existing disturbance, with the exception of the bridge and boardwalk. Existing
potential for habitat at this location to function as a wildlife movement corridor is compromised by its proximity
to residential neighborhoods, well-traveled roads (U.S. 50 and East Venice Drive), and recreation disturbance on
Lake Tahoe. The proposed bridge would be located outside of the 100-year floodplain; therefore, wildlife
communities would continue to have access within the riparian corridor and to the Lake Tahoe shorezone, under
the proposed bridge. The bridge and boardwalk are not expected to bifurcate any important habitat areas or
prevent wildlife from continuing to access or travel between habitat areas in the vicinity.
The increased area and improved ecosystem functions of SEZ, floodplain, and riparian and wetland communities
along the Upper Truckee River under Alternative 1 would benefit wildlife communities; these benefits would
improve the SEZ’s wildlife corridor function by increasing habitat quality, connectivity of native vegetation, and
corridor width. This long-term effect would be beneficial.
Implementing Alternative 1 could interfere with wildlife movement in the short term because it would involve
four years of intermittent disturbance from construction activities and short-term disturbance of 14 acres of
vegetation. However, the Conservancy would implement ECs 5 and 6 to minimize these disturbances and
revegetate areas disturbed by construction. Construction activities would be temporary, restricted daily from 8:00
a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday–Friday, and restricted seasonally to May 1–October 15 (or a more limited period if a
limited operation period is necessary to avoid effects to sensitive wildlife). The 14 acres of vegetation that would

be disturbed and require several years to recover represents a very small portion of the study area, and thus, most
habitat in the study area would remain intact.
Because construction impacts on wildlife movement would be short term and corridor access would continue to
be provided under the proposed bridge in the long term wildlife movement would not be blocked and the effect on
wildlife movement would not be substantial. This impact would be less than significant.
Alternative 2: New Channel—West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure)
IMPACT
3.4-1
(Alt. 2)

Introduction and Spread of Invasive Plants by Construction Activities. (CEQA 2, 3; TRPA 12) Under
Alternative 2, construction activities could introduce or spread nonnative, invasive plant species. Unwashed
construction equipment could carry invasive plant seed or other propagules from infested sites outside of the
study area; seed mixes or soil amendments containing invasive plant seed could be used during revegetation;
soil containing invasive plant seed could be redistributed in the study area; and multiple sites would be
disturbed, providing conditions favorable for invasive plant establishment. During construction, it is likely that
one or more invasive plant species would be introduced or spread by one or more of these mechanisms.
However, as described in Environmental Commitment 4, the Conservancy would implement invasive plant
management practices to avoid invasive species being introduced during construction. Therefore, this impact
would be less than significant.

This impact is identical to Impact 3.4-1 (Alt. 1). For the same reasons as described above, this impact would be
less than significant.
IMPACT
3.4-2
(Alt. 2)

Introduction and Spread of Invasive Plants by Recreational Activities. (NEPA) Under Alternative 2, there
would be a slight increase in the number of visitors to the study area, and these visitors could contribute to the
introduction and spread of invasive plants by dispersing these plants and disturbing habitat. However, there
would also be a substantial reduction in habitat disturbance because existing user-created trails would be
removed from core habitat and habitat protection features would be installed to reduce habitat disturbance by
visitors. The reduction in recreational use of core habitat and habitat disturbance would reduce the introduction
and spread of invasive plants by recreational activities despite the small increase in number of visitors. This
effect would be beneficial.

Recreational users can disperse invasive plants from infested sites into the study area and can disturb vegetation,
which facilitates establishment of invasive plants. Currently, visitors and their pets use an extensive network of
user-created trails in most habitats of the study area. Visitors also enter habitats from along the Upper Truckee
River and the shoreline of Lake Tahoe. In all these areas, visitors disperse invasive plants and disturb vegetation,
facilitating the establishment of invasive plants. Implementing Alternative 2 would remove these user-created
trails from the core habitat area, which would reduce the disturbance of vegetation and dispersal of invasive plants
in those areas. In addition, habitat protection features (e.g., signage) would be incorporated into recreation
infrastructure to reduce habitat disturbance. Therefore, despite a slight increase in the number of visitors to the
study area under Alternative 2, this alternative would reduce habitat disturbance and the potential for the spread of
invasive plant species. This effect would be beneficial.
IMPACT

(Alt. 2)

Damage to or Mortality of Special-Status Plants Resulting from Construction Activities. (CEQA 1, 5;
TRPA 5) Under Alternative 2, construction activities related to recreation infrastructure would not occur in
occupied American mannagrass habitat. However, construction activities associated with river restoration at
the mouth of the Upper Truckee River would occur in or close to Tahoe yellow cress habitat that could be
occupied. Thus, these construction activities could damage or kill Tahoe yellow cress plants. This impact
would be potentially significant.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.4-3 (Alt. 1), but the potential for construction activities to affect special-status
plants is less under this alternative than under Alternative 1. Construction under Alternative 2 would be limited to
construction associated with the river mouth of the Upper Truckee River that would occur in or close to TYC
habitat; it would not include construction of a boardwalk, bridge, and bike trail in the areas where TYC may
occur. Similar to Alternative 1, this impact would be potentially significant.
Mitigation Measure 3.4-3 (Alt. 2): Conduct Protocol-Level Preconstruction Surveys and Avoid or Mitigate Impacts on
Tahoe Yellow Cress Plants.
This mitigation measure is identical to Mitigation Measure 3.4-3 (Alt. 1).
Significance after Mitigation: With implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.4-3 (Alt. 2), for the same reasons
described for Alternative 1, Impact 3.4-3 (Alt. 2) would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.4-4
(Alt. 2)

Altered Extent of Special-Status Plant Habitat. (NEPA) Under Alternative 2, lagoon restoration would
increase the extent of potential habitat for American mannagrass. Also, the restoration and increased
inundation of willow scrub-wet meadow under this alternative could increase the extent of habitat suitable for
American mannagrass. However, both of these effects are uncertain and may not alter the extent of suitable
habitat. Under Alternative 2, beach and dune restoration could and new river mouth construction likely would
increase the extent of habitat suitable for Tahoe yellow cress, and potential changes in sediment supply would
not be sufficient to substantially reduce Tahoe yellow cress habitat. In summary, the effect on the extent of
habitat for American mannagrass would be no effect to beneficial and for Tahoe yellow cress would be
beneficial. Therefore, this impact would be beneficial.

With regard to American mannagrass, this impact is similar to Impact 3.4-4 (Alt. 1), except that under Alternative 2,
the increase in the acreage of willow scrub-wet meadow would be slightly greater than under Alternative 1 (8.7
versus 8.2 acres) (Table 3.4-4), and increased inundation of willow scrub-wet meadow could also increase the extent
of habitat. With regard to TYC, beach and dune restoration could and new river mouth construction likely would
increase the extent of habitat suitable for TYC, and potential changes in sediment supply would not be sufficient to
substantially reduce TYC habitat. This impact would be beneficial.
IMPACT
3.4-5
(Alt. 2)

Damage to or Mortality of Special-Status Plants Resulting from Recreational Activities. (CEQA 1, 5;
TRPA 5) Under Alternative 2, damage to or mortality of special-status plants resulting from recreational
activities would not be substantially altered. Under existing conditions, habitat occupied by American
mannagrass plants is in a location that is not substantially disturbed by recreational activities, and
implementing Alternative 2 would maintain this condition. Under Alternative 2, the existing Tahoe yellow cress
management plan (including the Barton Beach exclosure and adaptive management) would continue to be
implemented and protect habitat occupied by Tahoe yellow cress at Barton Beach. Also, implementing
Alternative 2 would not substantially alter recreational use of Barton Beach or of habitat occupied by Tahoe
yellow cress at Cove East Beach. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

Alternative 2 would not include the bridge and boardwalk components of Alternative 1 or other components that
would increase recreational use of habitat occupied by TYC. Alternative 2 proposes the minimum level of
recreation infrastructure with proposed infrastructure being located outside of areas that support TYC and
American mannagrass. Under existing conditions, habitat occupied by American mannagrass plants is not
substantially disturbed by recreational activities, and implementing Alternative 2 would maintain this condition.
Under Alternative 2, the existing TYC management plan (including the Barton Beach exclosure and adaptive
management) would continue to be implemented and protect habitat occupied by TYC at Barton Beach.
Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

(Alt. 2)

Short-Term Disturbance of Sensitive Communities (Jurisdictional Wetlands, Riparian Vegetation, and
SEZ) Resulting from Construction Activities. (CEQA 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2, 4, 6) Implementing Alternative 2
would disturb sensitive communities. This disturbance would be short term. As described in Environmental
Commitments 5 and 6, the Conservancy would minimize the risk to water quality and vegetation and comply
with the terms and conditions of required permits to reduce this disturbance. Nonetheless, approximately 24
acres of sensitive communities would be disturbed. This impact would be significant.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.4-6 (Alt. 1) but greater because the acreage of sensitive communities disturbed
would be approximately 50 percent greater than under Alternative 1. For the same reasons described for
Alternative 1, this impact would be significant.
As described for Alternative 1, with implementation of ECs 5 and 6, this impact would be reduced, but the shortterm disturbance of sensitive communities would not be eliminated because such disturbance is integral to the
river, floodplain, and other restoration elements. For the same reasons described for Alternative 1, Impact 3.4-6
(Alt. 2) would be significant and unavoidable.
IMPACT
3.4-7
(Alt. 2)

Enhancement and Creation of Sensitive Communities (Jurisdictional Wetlands, Riparian Vegetation,
and SEZ) Resulting from River and Floodplain Restoration. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 2 would
convert some disturbed, developed, and restored upland shrub to sensitive communities. The combined
increase in extent of sensitive communities would be approximately 10 acres. Because the combined extent of
sensitive communities would be increased, this effect would be beneficial.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.4-7 (Alt. 1); Alternative 2 differs only slightly from Alternative 1 in the acreage
changes for different sensitive communities and in the increase in the combined acreage of sensitive communities.
Under Alternative 2, montane meadow would decrease by 0.8 acre as opposed to a small increase (0.2 acre) under
Alternative 1, and more lodgepole pine forest would be lost (1.4 versus 1.1 acres); however, slightly more beach
and dune habitat would be created (2.8 versus 2.7 acres under Alternative 2), as would more willow scrub-wet
meadow (8.7 versus 8.2 acres). The acreage of sensitive communities would increase by 10.1 acres under
Alternative 2 versus 9.9 acres under Alternative 1. Because river and floodplain restoration under Alternative 2
would increase the combined extent of sensitive communities and enhance the functions and services provided by
them, this long-term effect would be beneficial.
IMPACT
3.4-8
(Alt. 2)

Disruption of Wildlife Habitat Use and Loss of Wildlife Resulting from Construction Activities. (CEQA
1; TRPA 9, 10, 12) Under Alternative 2, construction activities could cause short-term disruption of wildlife use
of the study area, cause the loss of wildlife, or both. Wintering bald eagle use of the study area does not occur
during the construction season and thus would not be disrupted. However, construction of the restoration,
recreation, public access, and habitat protection elements of Alternative 2 could result in the harm or loss of
individuals or nests or result in substantial disruptions to nesting attempts or other activities by three specialstatus bird species (yellow warbler, willow flycatcher, and long-eared owl) and would affect one special-status
guild (waterfowl). It also could result in abandonment or removal of active roost sites for, or harm or loss of,
hoary bat or western red bat. This impact would be significant.

This impact is identical to Impact 3.4-8 (Alt. 1). For the same reasons provided for Alternative 1, this impact
would be significant.
Mitigation Measure 3.4-8A (Alt. 2): Conduct Preconstruction Surveys for Nesting Special-Status Birds (Yellow
Warbler, Willow Flycatcher, Waterfowl, and Long-Eared Owl), and Implement Buffers If Necessary.

(Alt. 2)

Altered Extent and Quality of Wildlife Habitats Resulting from River, Floodplain, and Other Restoration
and Enhancement Elements. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 2 would increase the extent of lagoon, willow
scrub-wet meadow, and beach and dune habitats; and enhance the habitat quality of willow scrub-wet
meadow, lagoon, and other floodplain habitats by increasing hydrologic connectivity of the river and its
floodplain. This effect would be beneficial.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.4-9 (Alt. 1), but under Alternative 2, the extent of enhanced floodplain habitat
would differ from that under Alternative 1. Both alternatives have the same lagoon, and beach and dune
restoration components, and the extent of willow scrub-wet meadow would increase similarly under both
alternatives (Table 3.4-4). However, implementing Alternative 2 would result in a greater increase in the
floodplain area inundated by two-year streamflow events when compared with Alternative 1 (that is, an increase
of 97 percent versus 18 percent) (Conservancy and DGS 2006:A1). Thus, the quality of wildlife habitats would be
enhanced more under Alternative 2 than under Alternative 1. For the same reasons described for Alternative 1,
this effect would be beneficial.
IMPACT
3.4-10
(Alt. 2)

Altered Quality of Wildlife Habitats Resulting from Altered Recreational Use. (NEPA) Implementing
Alternative 2 would improve the quality of wildlife habitat in much of the study area by removing user-created
trails from a core habitat area and by providing public access and habitat protection features that would
discourage recreational use of sensitive habitat areas, and engender a resource stewardship ethic in users.
This effect would be beneficial.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.4-10 (Alt. 1), but under Alternative 2, recreational use and the associated
human disturbance of wildlife would be much less than under Alternative 1. Alternative 2 would not include the
bridge and boardwalk that is expected to increase human presence and reduce wildlife use in the vicinity of
Barton Beach. Also, Alternative 2 would designate a larger area of core habitat than Alternative 1 (344 versus 308
acres). Overall, the reduction of human disturbance of wildlife by Alternative 2 would be greater than the
reduction under Alternative 1. This effect would be beneficial.
IMPACT
3.4-11
(Alt. 2)

Conversion of Forest Land to Nonforest Use. (CEQA 8, 9; TRPA 4, 5) Implementing the restoration
elements of Alternative 2 would convert approximately 0.1 acre of Jeffrey pine forest and 1.4 acres of
lodgepole pine forest to natural vegetation types that are dominated by shrubs or herbaceous plants. This
would be long-term, but not permanent conversion. This conversion would allow continued management for
resource values including recreation, biodiversity, aesthetics, and water quality. In addition, river and
floodplain restoration would enhance habitat values of the remaining forest land. Because the area of forest
land conversion would be small, not permanent, allow for continued management of most resource values
provided by the existing forest land, and enhance the resource values of remaining forest, this impact would
be less than significant.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.4-11 (Alt. 1), but Alternative 2 would convert slightly more lodgepole pine
forest than Alternative 1 (1.4 versus 1.1 acres, respectively). However, for the same reasons as described for
Alternative 1, this impact would be less than significant.

Implementing Alternative 2 would result in short-term disturbance that could interfere with wildlife use of this
corridor. However, temporary construction-related disturbance would be restricted daily and seasonally, and
disturbance to vegetation would affect only a small portion of the study area. Furthermore, as described in
Environmental Commitments 5 and 6, the Conservancy would minimize vegetation disturbance and
revegetate. Therefore, wildlife movement would not be blocked and the effect on wildlife movement would not
be substantial. This impact would be less than significant.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.4-12 (Alt. 1), but Alternative 2 would not include a bridge over the Upper

This impact is similar to Impact 3.4-1 (Alt. 1); however, Alternative 3 would construct less recreation
infrastructure than Alternative 1 and more than Alternative 2. As described in EC 4 (Table 2-6), the Conservancy

introduction and spread of invasive plants by recreational activities despite the small increase in number of
visitors. This effect would be beneficial.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.4-2 under Alternative 2, and unlike Alternative 1, would result in a reduction in
dispersal of invasive plants and habitat disturbance. Implementing Alternative 3 would cause a reduction in the

Altered Extent of Special-Status Plant Habitat. (CEQA 1, 5; TRPA 5) Under Alternative 3, the extent of

not be components of Alternative 3. The restoration and increased inundation of willow scrub-wet meadow
could increase the extent of habitat suitable for American mannagrass. However, both of these effects are
uncertain and may not alter the extent of suitable habitat. Potential changes in sediment supply would not be
sufficient to substantially reduce Tahoe yellow cress habitat. In summary, the effect on the extent of habitat for
American mannagrass would be no effect to beneficial and for Tahoe yellow cress would be less than
significant. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

Under Alternative 3, the extent of habitat for special-status plants (i.e., American mannagrass and TYC) would
remain largely unaltered. Restoration of lagoon habitat potentially suitable for American mannagrass would not
be a component of Alternative 3. The restoration and increased inundation of willow scrub-wet meadow could
increase the extent of habitat suitable for American mannagrass; however, because the microhabitat requirements
of American mannagrass (e.g., mud benches along Trout Creek) are uncertain, habitat suitable for American
mannagrass may not increase. Restoration of beach and dune habitat potentially suitable for TYC would not be a
component of Alternative 3. Also, potential changes in sediment supply would not be sufficient to substantially
alter TYC habitat. Therefore, the impact on the extent of habitat for American mannagrass and TYC would be less
than significant.

3.4-5
(Alt. 3)

Damage to or Mortality of Special-Status Plants Resulting from Recreational Activities. (CEQA 1, 5;
TRPA 5) Under Alternative 3, damage to or mortality of special-status plants resulting from recreational
activities would not be substantially altered. Under existing conditions, habitat occupied by American
mannagrass plants is in a location that is not substantially disturbed by recreational activities, and
implementing Alternative 3 would maintain this condition. Under Alternative 3, the existing Tahoe yellow cress
management plan (including the Barton Beach exclosure and adaptive management) would continue to be
implemented and protect Tahoe yellow cress. Also, implementing Alternative 3 would not substantially alter
recreational use of Barton Beach or habitat occupied by Tahoe yellow cress at Cove East Beach. Therefore,
this impact would be less than significant.

This impact is identical to Impact 3.4-5 (Alt. 2). For the same reasons as described above, this impact would be
less than significant.
IMPACT
3.4-6
(Alt. 3)

Short-Term Disturbance of Sensitive Communities (Jurisdictional Wetlands, Riparian Vegetation, and
SEZ) Resulting from Construction Activities. (CEQA 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2, 4, 6) Implementing Alternative 3
would disturb sensitive communities. This disturbance would be short term. As described in Environmental
Commitments 5 and 6, the Conservancy would minimize the risk to water quality and vegetation and comply
with the terms and conditions of required permits to reduce this disturbance. Nonetheless, approximately 18
acres of sensitive communities would be disturbed. This impact would be significant.

This impact would be similar to Impact 3.4-6 under Alternatives 1 and 2. It would be comparable to Alternative 1
and less than under Alternative 2 because the amount of acreage of sensitive communities disturbed would be
comparable to that under Alternative 1 and less than that under Alternative 2. For the same reasons described for
Alternative 1, this impact would be significant.
As described for Alternative 1, with implementation of ECs 5 and 6, this impact would be reduced, but the shortterm disturbance of sensitive communities would not be eliminated because such disturbance is integral to the
river, floodplain, and other restoration elements. For the same reasons described for Alternative 1, Impact 3.4-6
(Alt. 3) would be significant and unavoidable.
IMPACT
3.4-7
(Alt. 3)

Enhancement and Creation of Sensitive Communities (Jurisdictional Wetlands, Riparian Vegetation,
and SEZ) Resulting from River and Floodplain Restoration. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 3 would
convert some disturbed, developed, and restored upland shrub to sensitive communities. The combined
increase in the extent of sensitive communities would be approximately eight acres. Because the combined
extent of sensitive communities would be increased, this effect would be beneficial.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.4-7 under Alternatives 1 and 2; Alternative 3 differs from Alternatives 1 and 2
in that no net change in lagoon, beach and dune, or Jeffrey pine forest would occur; montane meadow would
increase by 1.7 acres rather than increase by 0.2 acre (Alternative 1) or decrease (as under Alternative 2); and the
acreage changes for different sensitive communities are less certain because natural processes would dictate the
exact location of a portion of the restored river channel. Also, the increase in the combined acreage of sensitive
communities would be smaller under Alternative 3 than under Alternative 1 or 2 (eight acres versus
approximately ten acres) (Table 3.4-4). Because river and floodplain restoration under Alternative 3 would
increase the combined extent of sensitive communities and enhance the functions and services provided by them,
this long-term effect would be beneficial.

(Alt. 3)

Disruption of Wildlife Habitat Use and Loss of Wildlife Resulting from Construction Activities. (CEQA
1; TRPA 9, 10, 12) Under Alternative 3, construction activities could cause short-term disruption of wildlife use
of the study area, cause the loss of wildlife, or both. Wintering bald eagle use of the study area does not occur
during the construction season and thus would not be disrupted. However, construction of the restoration,
recreation, public access, and habitat protection elements of Alternative 3 could result in the harm or loss of
individuals or nests or result in substantial disruptions to nesting attempts or other activities by three specialstatus bird species (yellow warbler, willow flycatcher, and long-eared owl) and would affect one special-status
guild (waterfowl). It also could result in abandonment or removal of active roost sites for, or harm or loss of,
hoary bat or western red bat. This impact would be significant.

This impact is identical to Impact 3.4-8 (Alt. 1). For the same reasons as described for Alternative 1, this impact
would be significant.
Mitigation Measure 3.4-8A (Alt. 3): Conduct Preconstruction Surveys for Nesting Special-Status Birds (Yellow
Warbler, Willow Flycatcher, Waterfowl, and Long-Eared Owl), and Implement Buffers If Necessary.
This mitigation measure is identical to Mitigation Measure 3.4-8A (Alt. 1).
Mitigation Measure 3.4-8B (Alt. 3): Conduct Preconstruction Surveys for Special-Status Bats, Avoid Removal of
Important Roosts, and Implement a Limited Operating Period If Necessary.
This mitigation measure is identical to Mitigation Measure 3.4-8B (Alt. 1).
Significance after Mitigation: With implementation of Mitigation Measures 3.4-8A (Alt. 3) and 3.4-8B (Alt. 3),
for the same reasons described for Alternative 1 that is, because avoiding substantial effects on waterfowl nesting
would not be feasible, Impact 3.4-8 (Alt. 3) would be significant and unavoidable.
IMPACT
3.4-9
(Alt. 3)

Altered Extent and Quality of Wildlife Habitats Resulting from River, Floodplain, and Other
Restoration and Enhancement Elements. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 3 would increase the extent of
willow scrub-wet meadow habitat; and enhance the habitat quality of willow scrub-wet meadow, lagoon, and
other floodplain habitats by increasing hydrologic connectivity of the river and its floodplain. This effect would
be beneficial.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.4-9 under Alternatives 1 and 2; however, under Alternative 3, the extent and
location of restored and enhanced habitats would differ from those under Alternative 1 (Table 3.4-4), and there is
greater uncertainty regarding the effects of Alternative 3 on wildlife habitats. Unlike Alternatives 1 and 2,
Alternative 3 would not increase the acreage of lagoon or beach and dune habitats. As with Alternatives 1 and 2,
Alternative 3 would increase the acreage of willow scrub-wet meadow (Table 3.4-4), and enhance floodplain
habitats by increasing river-floodplain connectivity. However, natural processes would be allowed to dictate the
exact location and form of a portion of the restored river channel, so there is less certainty regarding the resulting
vegetation and floodplain properties than for Alternatives 1 and 2. It is anticipated that implementing Alternative
3 would result in greater river-floodplain connectivity than would occur under Alternatives 1 and 2. For example,
the area inundated by a two-year streamflow event would increase by approximately 142 percent, compared to 18
and 97 percent under Alternatives 1 and 2, respectively (Conservancy and DGS 2006:A1). For the same reasons
provided for Alternative 1, the effect of river, floodplain, and other restoration and enhancement elements on
wildlife habitat would be beneficial.

IMPACT
3.4-10
(Alt. 3)

Altered Quality of Wildlife Habitats Resulting from Altered Recreational Use. (NEPA) Implementing
Alternative 3 would improve the quality of wildlife habitat in much of the study area by removing user-created
trails from a core habitat area and by providing public access with habitat protection features that would
discourage recreational use of sensitive habitat areas, and engender a resource stewardship ethic in users. At
Cove East Beach, the extent of recreational use would be similar to or slightly greater than existing conditions,
and would not adversely affect wintering bald eagles. This effect would be beneficial.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.4-10 (Alts. 1 and 2), but implementing Alternative 3 would alter the human
disturbance of habitat in different locations than would implementing Alternative 1 or 2. Unlike Alternative 2,
Alternative 3 includes recreation infrastructure in the eastern portion of the study area, similar to but less than
Alternative 1. Unlike Alternative 1, Alternative 3 would not include the bridge and boardwalk that could increase
human disturbance of wildlife in the vicinity of Barton Beach. However, because Alternative 3 involves
relocating the Upper Truckee River to the center of the study area, it would result in a much smaller area of core
habitat than Alternatives 1 and 2 (251 acres versus 308 and 344 acres, respectively), and habitat west of the river
could experience greater human disturbance than under existing conditions. Overall, under Alternative 3, the
enhancement of wildlife habitat from reducing human disturbance would be comparable to that under Alternative
2. For the same reasons described for Alternative 2, this effect would be beneficial.
IMPACT
3.4-11
(Alt. 3)

Conversion of Forest Land to Nonforest Use. (CEQA 8, 9; TRPA 4, 5) Implementing the restoration
elements of Alternative 3 would convert approximately 0.8 acre of lodgepole pine forest to natural vegetation
types that are dominated by shrubs or herbaceous plants. This would be long-term, but not permanent
conversion. This conversion would allow continued management for resource values including recreation,
biodiversity, aesthetics, and water quality. In addition, river and floodplain restoration would enhance habitat
values of the remaining forest land. Because the area of forest land conversion would be small, not
permanent, allow for continued management of most resource values provided by the existing forest land, and
enhance the resource values of remaining forest, this impact would be less than significant.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.4-11 (Alts. 1 and 2), but Alternative 3 would not convert Jeffrey pine forest,
and would convert slightly less lodgepole pine forest than Alternatives 1 and 2 (0.8 acre versus 1.1 and 1.4 acres,
respectively). However, for the same reasons as described for Alternative 1, this impact would be less than
significant.
IMPACT
3.4-12
(Alt. 3)

Interference with Wildlife Use of Established Movement Corridors. (CEQA 4, TRPA 11) The study area
may function as a corridor for wildlife movement between the Lake Tahoe shorezone and areas upstream.
Implementing Alternative 3 would result in short-term disturbance that could interfere with wildlife use of this
corridor. However, short-term construction-related disturbance would be restricted daily and seasonally, and
short-term disturbance to vegetation would affect only a small portion of the study area. Furthermore, as
described in Environmental Commitments 5 and 6, the Conservancy would minimize vegetation disturbance
and revegetate. Therefore, wildlife movement would not be blocked and the effect on wildlife movement would
not be substantial. This impact would be less than significant.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.4-12 (Alts. 1 and 2), but implementing Alternative 3 would result in slightly
less short-term disturbance of vegetation than Alternative 1 and less than Alternative 2 (13.6 acres versus 14 and
20.7 acres, respectively). Alternative 3 does not include a bridge over the Upper Truckee River. For similar
reasons as described for Alternative 1, this impact would be less than significant.

IMPACT
3.4-1
(Alt. 4)

Introduction and Spread of Invasive Plants by Construction Activities. (CEQA 2, 3; TRPA 12) Under
Alternative 4, construction activities could introduce or spread nonnative, invasive plant species. Unwashed
construction equipment could carry invasive plant seed or other propagules from infested sites outside of the
study area; seed mixes or soil amendments containing invasive plant seed could be used during revegetation;
soil containing invasive plant seed could be redistributed in the study area; and multiple sites would be
disturbed, providing conditions favorable for invasive plant establishment. During construction, it is likely that
one or more invasive plant species would be introduced or spread by one or more of these mechanisms.
However, as described in Environmental Commitment 4, the Conservancy would implement invasive plant
management practices to avoid invasive species being introduced during construction. Therefore, this impact
would be less than significant.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.4-1 (Alt. 1), except that recreation infrastructure construction would be less
than under Alternative 1 and similar to construction under Alternative 3. For the same reasons as described above,
this impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.4-2
(Alt. 4)

Introduction and Spread of Invasive Plants by Recreational Activities. (NEPA) Under Alternative 4, there
would be a small increase in the number of visitors to the study area, and these visitors could contribute to the
introduction and spread of invasive plants by dispersing these plants and disturbing habitat. However, there
would also be a substantial reduction in habitat disturbance because existing user-created trails would be
removed from core habitat and habitat protection features (e.g., signage) would be incorporated into recreation
infrastructure to reduce habitat disturbance by visitors. The reduction in habitat disturbance would reduce the
introduction and spread of invasive plants by recreational activities despite the small increase in number of
visitors. This effect would be beneficial.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.4-2 under Alternatives 2 and 3, and unlike Alternative 1, would result in a
reduction in dispersal of invasive plants and habitat disturbance. Under Alternatives 1–3, the reduction of the
introduction and spread of invasive plants would be related to the extent of the alternative’s core habitat area.
Therefore, implementing Alternative 4 would provide a comparable reduction to Alternative 2, and more of a
reduction than Alternative 3. For the same reasons as described above, this effect would be beneficial.
IMPACT
3.4-3
(Alt. 4)

Damage to or Mortality of Special-Status Plants Resulting from Construction Activities. (CEQA 1, 5;
TRPA 5) Under Alternative 4, construction activities would not occur in or near the habitat occupied by
American mannagrass or in or near habitat occupied by or potentially suitable for Tahoe yellow cress.
Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

This impact is identical to Impact 3.4-3 (Alt. 3). For the same reasons as described above for Alternative 3, this
impact would be potentially significant.
Mitigation Measure 3.4-3 (Alt. 4): Conduct Protocol-Level Preconstruction Surveys and Avoid or Mitigate Impacts on
Tahoe Yellow Cress Plants.
This mitigation measure is identical to Mitigation Measure 3.4-3 (Alt. 1).
Significance after Mitigation: With implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.4-3 (Alt. 4), for the same reasons
described for Alternative 1, Impact 3.4-3 (Alt. 4) would be less than significant.

not be components of Alternative 4. The restoration and increased inundation of willow scrub-wet meadow
under this alternative could increase the extent of habitat suitable for American mannagrass. However, both of
these effects are uncertain and may not alter the extent of suitable habitat. Potential changes in sediment
supply would not be sufficient to substantially reduce Tahoe yellow cress habitat. In summary, the effect on
the extent of habitat for American mannagrass would be no effect to beneficial and for Tahoe yellow cress

of montane meadow would be reduced, unlike Alternatives 1 and 3, and by more than Alternative 2 (3.6 acres

in Section 3.8, “Hydrology and Flooding.” Overall, river, floodplain, and other restoration and enhancement

Goals and Policies
Chapter IV (Conservation Element) of TRPA’s Goals and Policies establishes goals for the preservation,
development, utilization, and management of natural resources within the Tahoe Basin (TRPA 2004). These goals
are designed to achieve and maintain adopted environmental threshold carrying capacities and are implemented
through the Code of Ordinances.
The maintenance of essential habitat serves as the fisheries management emphasis for the Conservation Element
of TRPA’s Goals and Policies. Conservation Element/Fisheries Goal 1 is to “improve aquatic habitat essential for
the growth, reproduction and perpetuation of existing and threatened fish resources in the Tahoe Basin” (TRPA
2004). For streams within the Tahoe Basin, the management focus is the quality and quantity of habitat provided
for fish species including spawning and rearing habitat, food supply, and cover. The Conservation Element
identifies five attainment policies related to instream fish habitat:
1. Development proposals affecting streams, lakes, and adjacent lands shall evaluate impacts to the
fishery.
2. Unnatural blockages and other impediments to fish movement would be prohibited and removed
wherever appropriate.
3. Habitat improvement projects in streams and lakes shall be encouraged.

4. Instream flows shall be maintained or enhanced.
5. State and federal efforts to reintroduce Lahontan cutthroat trout shall be supported.
Code of Ordinances
Chapter 63 (Fish Resources) of TRPA’s Code of Ordinances (TRPA 2011) includes provisions for the protection
of fish habitat and the enhancement of degraded habitat. For instream habitats, protection provisions include
prohibiting stream channel alterations, facilitating fish movement at stream crossings, removing barriers to fish
movement, mitigating impacts to fish habitat from development, maintaining instream flows, preventing sediment
entry into the stream system, and encouraging native vegetative cover.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Aquatic Habitat in the Upper Truckee River
The reach of the Upper Truckee River within the study area is characterized by slow velocities and a low gradient
(0–1 percent); the substrate is composed primarily of peat, clay, sand, and fine sediment. The channel is incised
with steep banks and contains small amounts of woody material. Willows are the dominant woody riparian
vegetation along the channel. This reach is dominated by pool and deep run habitats near Lake Tahoe. At high
lake levels, substantial portions of the Upper Truckee River and its floodplain are submerged by Lake Tahoe and
become backwater habitat (DGS and Conservancy 1997). In normal and wet years, a backbeach “lagoon” is
seasonally created, developing in the spring in concert with increased river flows from snowmelt and then
receding in early to midsummer as the lake level and river flow decline. Lagoon habitat may be valuable for
spawning of lake-dwelling species and may provide temporary habitat for juvenile minnows or other fishes.
Unfortunately, recently introduced warm-water species have also invaded this habitat and may be detrimental to
its native species.
Fisheries in the Upper Truckee River
The fish community in the Tahoe Basin is affected primarily by trends related to decreased abundance of native
fish species and a shift from native to introduced fish species. Both of these trends are accelerated by aquatic
habitat degradation in the basin. Before the 1850s, nine native fish species occurred in the Tahoe Basin. Since that
time, 20 nonnative fish species have been introduced. At present, 24 species of fish occur in the Tahoe Basin, of
which 15 are found in Lake Tahoe (Table 3.5-1). The variety of fish introduced into the Tahoe Basin resulted
from actions by state agencies to improve fishing or prey species, and also from ill-informed and illegal
introductions from the public or anglers to establish new recreational fisheries. Most of these introductions were
made without an understanding of their impact on the native fauna.
Native minnows, suckers, sculpin, and trout are still found in the Upper Truckee River and in Lake Tahoe. These
native nongame species are important to the function of the stream ecosystem. Juveniles and smaller individuals
may be important prey for larger trout. Some of these species have special management status and a high
probability of occurrence in the study area (Table 3.5-2). The mountain sucker (Catostomus platyrhynchus) is a
California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) Species of Special Concern, and the Lahontan lake tui chub
(Gila bicolor pectinifer) is a CDFG Species of Special Concern and a USFS Sensitive Species. These special
management status designations encourage watershed managers to pay extra attention to the needs of these
species.
Introduced trout occupy the habitats once dominated by the native Lahontan cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii
henshawi). Lahontan cutthroat trout, which are federally listed as threatened, were only recently reported present
within the study area. Field crews from the USFS Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit surveyed the Upper
Truckee River from Lake Tahoe upstream approximately 19.3 kilometers (12 miles) in August and September
2011 as part of the USFS Basin-wide Non-game Fish Assessment. During this survey, two Lahontan cutthroat
trout were captured in the river, approximately 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) upstream of the lake. Both fish were

missing adipose fins and were determined to be hatchery fish that had been released by the Nevada Department of
Wildlife (NDOW) into Lake Tahoe near Cave Rock during the summer of 2011. This is the first time that
Lahontan cutthroat trout had been recorded as part of the fish assessment (Lemmers and Santora 2012). The
Lahontan cutthroat trout released near Cave Rock by NDOW in 2011 were released into Lake Tahoe to provide
anglers the chance to catch a native fish species that had not been available in the lake for a long time. This plant
was considered experimental and for recreational purposes and not as an attempt to repopulate Lake Tahoe.
NDOW’s staff will evaluate the performance of Lahontan cutthroat trout released into the lake, along with angler
satisfaction with the program (NDOW 2011).
When NDOW released Lahontan cutthroat trout into Lake Tahoe during the summer of 2011, no regulatory
framework was in place with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)—the regulatory agency responsible for
federally listed threatened species—but Lahontan cutthroat trout were shown to be present within the project area.
Therefore, appropriate Federal Endangered Species Act consultation procedures must be followed before project
construction activities may begin (UTRWAG 2012).
In addition to the NDOW release into Lake Tahoe in June 2011, Lahontan cutthroat trout were reintroduced into
the headwaters of the Upper Truckee River at Meiss Meadows in 1989 and 1990. Since then, efforts have been
underway to expand the species’ habitat downstream of Meiss Meadows, including perennial tributaries within
the Upper Truckee watershed (Moore 2010).
Brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are the dominant trout species within the
lower sections of the Upper Truckee River, although brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) occur as well in smaller
numbers (Conservancy 2007a). The USFS Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit manages the headwaters of the
Upper Truckee River for the benefit of reintroduced Lahontan cutthroat trout as part of its wild trout program.
The Upper Truckee River Marsh provides access (migration pathway) and temporary habitat for many fish
species that move from the lake to upstream segments of the river and Trout Creek for spawning. Lake-run and
resident rainbow and brown trout, Paiute sculpin (Cottus beldingi), Lahontan redside (Richardsonius egregius),
Lahontan stream tui chub (Gila bicolor obesa), Tahoe sucker (Catostomus tahoensis), and mountain whitefish
(Prosopium williamsoni) are known to move from the lake to tributary streams to access upstream spawning and
rearing habitats (Snider et al. 1987, Washoe Meadows State Park 1994). Shallow-water and backwater areas
within the marsh are known to provide important rearing habitat for minnows and juvenile suckers; however, the
utilization of marsh habitats by these species is not well documented (Conservancy 2007a).
Native aquatic invertebrates and plants are also important to the Upper Truckee River ecosystem. Aquatic
mollusks have received special attention due to marked declines throughout North America. The western
pearlshell mussel (Margaritifera falcata) is known to be a highly sensitive indicator species (Nedeau, Smith, and
Stone 2005; CDFG 2011) and is known to occur within the lower reaches of the Upper Truckee River, with large
aggregations occurring near the airport (Conservancy 2007b). It is not known whether it occurs in the Upper
Truckee River Marsh.
Herbst (2004) sampled eight sites along the main stem of the Upper Truckee River between 1998 and 2000, using
the California stream bioassessment protocols consisting of physical habitat surveys and biological sampling of
benthic macroinvertebrates to acquire baseline biomonitoring data. Herbst found that anthropogenic channel
disturbance increased on a downstream gradient, and the distribution of invertebrate taxa in the Upper Truckee
River was related to these habitat differences. He noted a general downstream trend of a loss of diversity,
sensitive organisms, and community stability.
Since 2002, several warm-water fishes—largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), smallmouth bass
(Micropterus dolomieu), and brown bullhead (Ictalurus nebulosus)—have appeared in Lake Tahoe and some
tributary streams (Moyle 2002). Their effects on native fish and invertebrates are unknown at this time. However,
these introductions usually have an adverse effect on native fishes (and possibly amphibians and invertebrates)
that use warm-water habitats in Lake Tahoe and tributary streams. The Tahoe Keys appears to be the location

where most of these nonnative species first became established in the lake. These species have dispersed from
there into Pope Marsh, the Upper Truckee River, and Taylor Creek. Introduced warm-water fishes are being
closely monitored by USFS (USFS 2012). Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) is a nonnative aquatic
plant that has been introduced to Lake Tahoe and has the potential to substantially alter aquatic habitat function in
favor of nonnative fish species. Studies on the distribution of this plant and potential methods that may be used to
control it are ongoing. USFWS is developing an approach to control and/or remove nonnative aquatic species
within the Tahoe-Truckee system to protect native species.

3.5.2

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES AND MITIGATION MEASURES

SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA
For this analysis, significance criteria are based on the checklist presented in Appendix G of the State CEQA
Guidelines; the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist; factual or scientific information and data; and regulatory
standards of federal, state, and local agencies. These criteria also encompass the factors taken into account under
NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and intensity of its effects.
CEQA Criteria
Under CEQA, an alternative was determined to result in a significant effect related to fisheries and other aquatic
resources if it would:
►

have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or through habitat modifications, on any species identified as
a candidate, sensitive, or special-status species in local or regional plans, policies, or regulations, or by the
CDFG or USFWS (CEQA 1);

►

have a substantial adverse effect on any riparian habitat or other sensitive natural community identified in
local or regional plans, policies, regulations, or by the CDFG and USFWS (CEQA 2); or

►

interfere substantially with the movement of any native resident or migratory fish species (CEQA 3).

NEPA Criteria
An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the
environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the proposed action. Under NEPA, the significance
of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account
under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are
encompassed by the CEQA criteria used for this analysis.
TRPA Criteria
Based on TRPA’s Initial Environmental Checklist, an alternative was determined to result in a significant impact
related to fisheries and other aquatic resources if it would:
►

substantially degrade the quality of the environment, substantially reduce the habitat of a fish or wildlife
species, cause a fish or wildlife population to drop below self-sustaining levels, threaten to eliminate a plant
or animal community, or reduce the number or restrict the range of a rare or endangered plant or animal
(TRPA 1);

►

change the diversity or distribution of species, or numbers of any species of animals (birds, land animals
including reptiles, fish and shellfish, benthic organisms, insects, mammals, amphibians, or microfauna)
(TRPA 2);

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Fisheries

3.5-6

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

►

reduce the number of any unique, rare, or endangered species of animals (TRPA 3); or

►

introduce new species of animals into an area, or result in a barrier to the migration or movement of animals
(TRPA 4).

Although not used as significance criteria, effects on TRPA thresholds were evaluated, and these effects are
reported in Section 4.5, “Consequences for Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities.” In developing
mitigation measures for significant impacts of the project, effects on environmental thresholds of the Tahoe
Regional Planning Compact were considered.

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
The impact analysis for fisheries and aquatic resources examines effects of each alternative in both the short term
and the long term. Short-term effects could occur over hours, days, or weeks during the active construction phase
Long-term effects are the result of changes to the river channel and associated riparian corridor and include
changes to habitat conditions over a period of time after the channel has been activated.
Information related to the study area and vicinity and professional experience on similar projects has been
referenced and incorporated into the analysis of the river system history, existing condition, likely future
conditions, and conditions expected under each action alternative. The impact analysis for fisheries and aquatic
resources relies on information and analysis provided in Section 3.8, “Hydrology and Flooding” and Section 3.9,
“Geomorphology and Water Quality.” As discussed in Section 3.9, potential violations of the narrative turbidity
standard at the low end of the nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) range, while considered a significant impact for
CEQA/NEPA/TRPA analysis for the water quality discussion in this document, would not necessarily correspond
to an adverse effect on beneficial uses related to fisheries and other aquatic organisms. To evaluate effects on
beneficial uses, the water quality analysis considers aesthetic values under Non-Contact Recreation Use
designation in the Basin Plan (Lahontan RWQCB 1995:2-2) as the most sensitive indicator of an effect on any
beneficial uses. The turbidity values that would correlate with this impairment of aesthetics-related beneficial use
might not occur unless turbidity was increased beyond natural seasonal background by several orders of
magnitude. This is well beyond the <10 percent increase in background turbidity standard of the Basin Plan that
was used to evaluate water quality impacts in the water quality section due to the sensitivity of Lake Tahoe.
Turbidity levels would also likely need to exceed the minimum aesthetic criterion to have adverse effects on other
beneficial uses, including those supporting aquatic organisms. A finding of a significant unavoidable water
quality impact caused by exceedance of the stringent numeric standard does not automatically correspond to an
adverse condition for aquatic organisms because impairment of related beneficial uses would likely require the
proposed project to elevate turbidity levels considerably further than 10 percent above background for a greater
magnitude and longer duration beyond the limited area and brief period that was used for the water quality
analysis. Significance of a potential impact to aquatic species was evaluated based on anticipated effects on
population levels, survival rates, distribution, and habitat use.

(Alt. 1)

Short-Term Aquatic Habitat Degradation. (CEQA 1, 2, 3; TRPA 1) Short-term construction activities in
channels could temporarily reduce aquatic habitat quality by increasing turbidity within the construction site and
possibly Lake Tahoe during construction. However, as described in Environmental Commitments 5 and 6, the
Conservancy would implement effective construction-phase site management plans and comply with required
permits to minimize risks of water quality degradation. Although the strict turbidity standard would likely be
exceeded, the expected turbidity levels would not substantially affect the fisheries or aquatic habitat. Therefore,
this impact would be less than significant.

The proposed restoration activities under Alternative 1 would include constructing eight vertical grade controls,
six lateral grade controls, 1,300 feet of bank protection work, 3,890 feet of new channel, and 200 feet of river
mouth, and connecting the existing Sailing Lagoon to the river and marsh. These activities would include
isolating the construction sites, removing the water from the construction sites and then “rewatering” the sites. All
grading, placement of lateral and vertical grade-control structures, addition of sand, gravel, or cobble, and
placement of willow clumps or revegetation efforts would occur in isolated construction sites by using isolating
barriers and diverting or pumping flow around the work area. The newly constructed channels would be isolated
and dewatered. Before reconnection of the new channels to the active channel, the newly excavated channel
segments would be flushed with water (“rewatered”) to remove as much fine sediment as possible. The water
would be pumped out of the downstream end of the channel segment and used for irrigation or discharged to
temporary detention basins for sediment removal. Once the quality of dewatering effluent meets previously
established criteria, the isolating barriers would be removed, connecting the new segment to the active channel.
Pump intakes would be screened to limit the potential for the entrainment of nonnative aquatic vegetation, fish,
and invertebrates during dewatering activities.
Because of the large scale of the dewatering and rewatering activities associated with these actions, there is a high
risk of some discharge of sediments to active surface waters. These discharges would be likely to cause an
exceedance of the very strict turbidity standards during construction and shortly thereafter as the channel adjusts.
The extent of fisheries impacts, such as behavioral changes related to turbidity and dissolved oxygen levels would
be related to the extent of in-channel disturbance and best management practices in place. For Alternative 1, 3,890
feet of new channel would be created, and eight vertical grade-control structures would be installed in the existing
channel. The primary effects on water quality would occur during dewatering and rewatering of construction sites
for the grade control structure and during the connection of the new channel to the existing channel. With
implementation of Environmental Commitment (EC) 5, “Prepare and Implement Effective Construction Site
Management Plans to Minimize Risks of Water Quality Degradation and Impacts to Vegetation,” and EC 6,
“Obtain and Comply with Federal, State, Regional, and Local Permits,” described in Table 2-6 in Chapter 2, the
potential impacts would be limited in magnitude and short in duration. Although the turbidity standard would
likely be exceeded, the fisheries beneficial use would not be adversely affected. Trout initiate turbidity avoidance
behaviors at around 25 NTU (ENTRIX 2005). The turbidity impact is unlikely to exceed this level, except during
spikes of very short duration.
With implementation of site management practices as described in EC 5 and compliance with permits as
described in EC 6, turbidity would not substantially affect fisheries or aquatic habitat. Therefore, this impact
would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.5-2
(Alt. 1)

Stranding of Aquatic Biota from Dewatering Work Sites and Abandoning the Old Channel. (CEQA 1, 2,
3; TRPA 2, 3, 4) Certain construction activities—diverting streamflow from sections of the Upper Truckee
River, dewatering the Sailing Lagoon, and abandoning the old channel—could result in stranding and mortality
of fish and other aquatic biota, potentially including special-status species such as Lahontan cutthroat trout and
Lahontan tui chub. As described in Environmental Commitment 7, the Conservancy would implement an
aquatic species rescue and relocation plan that would reduce stranding and mortality of species in dewatered
areas and the abandoned channel. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

Alternative 1 would involve dewatering and diverting flows around in-channel work areas to construct
improvements, dewatering the Sailing Lagoon to connect it with the marsh and new river channel, and dewatering
and then backfilling the old channel to abandon it. All these construction activities would require temporarily
dewatering the active river channel. This dewatering would cause stranding and mortality of fish and other aquatic
biota. Several special-status species, including the Lahontan cutthroat trout (federally listed as threatened) and the
Lahontan tui chub (a California Species of Special Concern) could be affected.

To minimize the stranding of fish and aquatic biota, however, the Conservancy would implement EC 7, “Prepare
and Implement an Aquatic Species Rescue and Relocation Plan,” described in Table 2-6 in Chapter 2. Under this
plan, the Conservancy would retain a qualified biologist(s) to oversee rescue and relocate fish, freshwater
mussels, and other important native aquatic species when flows are diverted to a new channel, and when water is
pumped out of the Sailing Lagoon and diverted around in-channel construction sites. Organisms would be
removed from these sites and transported and released into suitable sites that would not be or have already been
restored (i.e., Lake Tahoe or sites on the Upper Truckee River). All equipment used for dewatering and fish or
mussel rescue would be properly decontaminated to kill or remove all potential invasive aquatic species
(i.e., Eurasian watermilfoil). All pump intakes would be screened to limit entrainment of fish and aquatic weeds
(i.e., Eurasian watermilfoil). All activities would occur in compliance with TRPA’s Lake Tahoe Region Aquatic
Invasive Species Management Plan.
Implementing EC 7 would minimize stranding and mortality of aquatic biota in the project area. Therefore, this
impact would be less than significant.

Short-Term Disruption of Fish Passage/Migration. (CEQA 3; TRPA 2, 3, 4) Construction of restoration
improvements may result in short-term disruption of fish passage between the Upper Truckee River and Lake
Tahoe or in-river seasonal migration. The temporary fish barriers would be in place for construction for a
relatively short time period that would not encompass all of the spawning season for any of the fish species.
This impact would be less than significant.

As part of Alternative 1, eight vertical grade-control structures in the existing channel and 3,890 feet of new
channel would be constructed. Installation of the grade-control structures would require dewatering and routing
flows around these dewatered segments in bypass channels or pipes. Dewatering and rerouting flows may obstruct
fish movement within the Upper Truckee River and to Lake Tahoe. Activating the new channel section would
require diverting flow around the old channel, constructing tie-ins, and filling the old channel. These actions
would result in temporary barriers to fish passage.
Several species of native minnows move locally from the lake into streams for spawning in spring, and mountain
suckers move locally within the stream for spawning in midsummer. The primary spawning periods for rainbow
trout and Lahontan redsides—spring and early summer—coincide with snowmelt runoff. Mountain suckers are
late spring and summer spawners. Mountain whitefish migrate upstream for spawning in the fall (October–
December). The project could block fish passage during some of these time periods, but not all of them.
Construction would occur during low-flow conditions, and diversions would occur between August and midOctober. The temporary fish barriers would be in place for dewatering and diversions for a relatively short time
period that would not encompass all of the spawning season for any of the fish species; therefore, the
construction-phase impact would be less than significant.

Introduction and Spread of Aquatic Invasive Species by Construction Activities. (CEQA 1, 2; TRPA 1, 4)
Aquatic invasive species (i.e., the plant Eurasian watermilfoil) are located in the Upper Truckee River and the
Sailing Lagoon and could potentially be introduced and spread to the river via construction activities.
Implementation of an invasive species management plan, as described in Environmental Commitment 4 and
which specifically addresses invasive plant management, would substantially reduce the potential for existing
aquatic invasive species to spread. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

Aquatic invasive species are located in the Upper Truckee River channel and the adjacent Sailing Lagoon. The
invasive aquatic plant, Eurasian watermilfoil, is a particular species of concern. Channel construction activities
and connection of the Sailing Lagoon to the marsh and channel, including direct actions and aquatic species
rescue and relocation, present a risk of introducing and spreading invasive species like Eurasian watermilfoil in
the river. EC 4, “Prepare and Implement an Invasive Species Management Plan,” described in Table 2-6 in
Chapter 2 describes the development of an invasive species management plan that would substantially reduce the
risk of spreading the invasive species. A qualified biologist with experience in the Tahoe Basin and aquatic
invasive species would conduct a preconstruction survey to determine the type and extent of the invasive species.
An eradication plan would be implemented to ensure that all aquatic species were removed before active
construction. The site would be monitored for four years after construction. Any infestations documented would
be treated and eradicated.
With implementation of EC 4, the risk of introduction and spread of aquatic invasive species, such as the invasive
plant Eurasian milfoil, would be substantially reduced. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

IMPACT
3.5-1
(Alt. 2)

Short-Term Aquatic Habitat Degradation. (CEQA 1, 2, 3; TRPA 1) Short-term construction activities in
channels could temporarily reduce aquatic habitat quality by increasing turbidity within the construction site and
possibly Lake Tahoe during construction. However, as described in Environmental Commitments 5 and 6, the
Conservancy would implement effective construction-phase site management plans and comply with required
permits to minimize risks of water quality degradation. Although the strict turbidity standard would likely be
exceeded, the expected turbidity levels would not substantially affect the fisheries or aquatic habitat. Therefore,
this impact would be less than significant.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.5-1 (Alt. 1). The proposed restoration activities under Alternative 2 would
include constructing two vertical grade controls, six lateral grade controls, 1,300 feet of bank protection, 8,420
feet of new channel, and 51,000 square feet of river mouth, and connecting the existing Sailing Lagoon to the
river and marsh. This alternative would include the same types of construction activities, techniques, and potential
impacts as Alternative 1.
With implementation of ECs 5 and 6, the potential impacts would be limited in magnitude and short in duration.
Although the turbidity standard would likely be exceeded, the fisheries beneficial use would not be adversely
affected. Trout initiate turbidity avoidance behaviors at around 25 NTU (ENTRIX 2005). The turbidity impact is
unlikely to exceed this level, except during spikes of very short duration during construction and shortly thereafter
as the channel adjusts.
With implementation of site management practices as described in EC 5 and compliance with permits as
described in EC 6, turbidity would not substantially affect fisheries or aquatic habitat. Therefore, this impact
would be less than significant.

River, dewatering the Sailing Lagoon, and abandoning the old channel—could result in stranding and mortality
of fish and other aquatic biota, potentially including special-status species such as Lahontan cutthroat trout and
Lahontan tui chub. As described in Environmental Commitment 7, the Conservancy would implement an
aquatic species rescue and relocation plan that would reduce stranding and mortality of species in dewatered
areas and the abandoned channel. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.5-2 (Alt. 1). The proposed restoration activities under Alternative 2 would
include constructing two vertical grade controls, six lateral grade controls, 1,300 feet of bank protection, 8,420

river and marsh. The scale of rescue and relocation of aquatic species would be greater under this alternative than
under Alternative 1 because the amount of new channel created, and therefore the amount of old channel filled,
would be greater. The greater area would require more rescue and relocation; however, implementing an aquatic
rescue and relocation plan, as described in EC 7, would minimize stranding and mortality of aquatic species in the
old channel. Under this plan, the Conservancy would retain a qualified biologist(s) to rescue and relocate fish,
freshwater mussels, and other important native aquatic species when flows are diverted to a new channel, and
when water is pumped out of the Sailing Lagoon and diverted around in-channel construction sites. Implementing

(Alt. 3)

Long-Term Disruption of Fish Passage/Migration. (CEQA 1, 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2, 3) Use of the pilot channel to
convey flow into small channels that cross the marsh to reenter the Upper Truckee River upstream of the
mouth at Lake Tahoe may result in long-term disruption of fish passage between the Upper Truckee River and
Lake Tahoe. Additionally, the alternative could generate natural barrier beach processes at the mouth of the
river that could seasonally close off the river from the lake. This impact would be potentially significant.

Fish passage between Lake Tahoe and the Upper Truckee River could be impeded in the absence of a defined
main channel or channels across the marsh connecting the river mouth to the upstream river. Many species of fish,
including rainbow trout, mountain whitefish, and Lahontan redsides, use the existing river channel as a migration
corridor from the lake to spawning habitat in the river. Rainbow trout and Lahontan redsides are spring spawning
fish, so it is likely that they would continue to successfully move into the Upper Truckee River for spawning
purposes. Additionally, Lahontan redsides are not obligate river spawning fish and can spawn along lakeshore
areas with gravel and larger substrates. Mountain whitefish, on the other hand, are large fish and fall spawners and
would not successfully be able to move upstream into the Upper Truckee River during low fall flows. Mountain
whitefish live for five to ten years. Passage impairments under Alternative 3 would be significant if the duration
of impairment would equal or exceed the minimum life span of a species, thereby affecting reproductive success
of an entire cohort (age group) of whitefish. If flow were not contained within a sufficiently deep and defined
channel, mountain whitefish would not be successful in gaining access to the river for a several years into the
future. A defined low-flow channel or channels would likely form after a few years, allowing sufficient passage
through the river.
During spring or winter flow events, when flow is routed through the pilot channel onto the meadow, juvenile and
adult fish moving downstream during these periods would be at risk of being stranded on the marsh surface.
These conditions would persist until a channel or channels have formed to reconnect the river to the lake. Because
of uncertainties about the period of time required for formation of a channel suitable for upstream fish passage
and downstream dispersal, this alternative has the potential to disrupt whitefish migrations for a substantial
number of migration seasons, and it would increase the risk from stranding for downstream moving fish in the
river. Therefore, the long-term impact on these fish populations in the Upper Truckee River and from Lake Tahoe
would be potentially significant.
Given the design of Alternative 3 (i.e., natural formation of channels downstream of the proposed “pilot
channel”), guaranteed fish passage would not be possible in the long term. Construction of a low-flow channel
suitable for fish passage through the upper marsh would not be consistent with the objective of Alternative 3 to
reestablish naturally dynamic channel/floodplain processes in the upper marsh.
In addition to the barriers likely created by the undefined channels, there is a chance that the mouth of the Upper
Truckee River and/or Trout Creek may close off to the lake at times as a result of natural barrier beach processes.
Such a barrier has been built up in the past during periods of time (months, seasons, or even years) when the

balance of flows and energy from the land/marsh side was low relative to the width of the beach ridge and the
height and energy of the lake’s wave action. Complex interactions may occur in the future, especially given the
underlying trends of beach erosion and the potential counteracting effects from climate change. It is not possible
to predict the locations, duration, or extent of potential river or creek mouth closures throughout the future life of
the project. This impact would be potentially significant.
Because the intent and purpose of this alternative is to restore natural river/marsh processes, alterations to the
design (construction of a dominant single thread channel) or future management actions (artificially maintaining
passage to the lake) would negate and contradict the intention of this alternative mitigation would not be possible.
Therefore, this impact would be significant and unavoidable.

and policies is presented in Section 3.10, “Land Use,” Table 3.10-1. The project’s effects on thresholds are
described in Section 4.5, “Consequences for Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities.”

The following state laws and regulations related to geologic resources are relevant to the proposed alternatives
and are described in detail in Chapter 5, “Compliance, Consultation, and Coordination”:
►
►
►

California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975
Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act
Seismic Hazards Mapping Act

Tahoe Regional Planning Agency
Goals and Policies
The following goals and policies in Chapter II (Land Use Element) of TRPA’s Goals and Policies (TRPA 2006)
related to land use are applicable to this analysis. (Text that is not relevant to the project has been omitted from
some of the following goals and policies.)
►

Land Use Goal 3: All new development shall conform to the coefficients of allowable land coverage as set
forth in “The Land Capability Classification of the Lake Tahoe Basin, California-Nevada, A Guide for
Planning, Bailey, 1974.” This goal calls for policies which limit allowable impervious land coverage
associated with new development. These policies set allowable land coverage by applying the recommended
Bailey land coverage coefficients to specifically defined and related areas. In some instances, provisions are
made to allow additional coverage by transfer. The transfer programs shall operate by a direct offset method.
In addition, land capability is one of the basic factors in determining the suitability of lands for development
and appropriateness of land uses.
•

Policy 1: Allowed base land coverage for all new projects and activities shall be calculated by applying
the Bailey coefficients, as shown below, to the applicable area within the parcel boundary, or as otherwise
set forth in A, B, and C of this policy. [The policy provides a table of maximum allowed land coverage
for each land capability district, ranging from one percent for Land Capability Districts (LCDs) 1a, 1b, 1c,
and 2 to 30 percent for Land Capability District 7.]

•

•

Policy 2: The allowed coverage in Policy 1 may be increased by transfer of land coverage within
hydrologically related areas up to the limits as set forth in A, B, C, D, and F of this policy [described in
the Goals and Ordinances, but not provided in this EIR/EIS/EIS]:
•

Land coverage may be transferred through programs that are further described in Goal #3 of the
development and implementation priorities subelement.

•

The intent of the land coverage transfer programs is to allow greater flexibility in the placement of
land coverage within hydrologically related areas. Such programs include the use of land banks, lot
consolidation, land coverage restoration programs, and transfer programs based on the calculation of
land coverage on non-contiguous parcels located in hydrologically related areas. The coverage
transfer programs allow for coverage over base coverage to be permitted and still be consistent with
the soils threshold and Goal #3 of this Subelement.

Policy 3: Rehabilitation, reconstruction, and upgrading of the existing inventory of structures, or other
forms of coverage in the Tahoe Region, are high priorities of the regional plan. To encourage
rehabilitation and upgrading of structures, the following policies shall apply:
B. Reconstruction, rehabilitation, modification, relocation, or major repair of structures or coverage
other than as specified in A may be allowed, provided such use is allowed under the land use
subelement, Goal #2, Policies 8, 9, and 10. For parcels with existing coverage in excess of the Bailey
Coefficients, a land coverage mitigation program shall be set by ordinance, which shall provide for
the reduction of coverage in an amount proportional to the cost of the repair, reconstruction,
relocation, rehabilitation, or modification, and to the extent of excess coverage. [Policy 3.B then lists
the minimum options available to property owners to accomplish these reductions.]
C. Existing coverage may be relocated within a parcel provided it is relocated to areas of equal or
superior environmental capability consistent with B above.
E. In approving repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, modification, or relocation of structures or other
coverage, the Agency shall also apply other relevant standards, including installation of Best
Management practices or compliance with the design review guidelines.

►

Natural Hazards Policies, Goal 1: Risks from natural hazards (e.g., flood, fire, avalanche, earthquake) will
be minimized.
•

Policy 2: Prohibit construction, grading, and filling of lands within the 100-year floodplain and in the area
of wave run-up except as necessary to implement the goals and policies of the plan. Require all public
utilities, transportation facilities, and other necessary public uses located in the 100-year flood plain and
area of wave run-up to be constructed or maintained to prevent damage from flooding and to not cause
flooding.

The following goals and policies in Chapter IV (Conservation Element) of TRPA’s Goals and Policies (TRPA
2004) related to soil productivity and stream environment zones (SEZs) are applicable to this analysis:
►

Soils, Goal 1: Minimize Soil Erosion and the Loss of Soil Productivity: Protection of the Region’s soil is
important for maintaining soil productivity and vegetative cover and preventing excessive sediment and
nutrient transport to the streams and lakes. Soil protection is especially critical in the Basin where the soils are
characteristically shallow and highly susceptible to erosion. Strategies for soil conservation are consistent
with thresholds established for soil, water, and vegetation.

•

Policy 1: Allowable impervious land coverage shall be consistent with the threshold for impervious land
coverage. The Land Use Subelement (see Goal 4) establishes policies which limit impervious land
coverage consistent with the impervious land coverage limits set forth in the “Land-Capability
Classification of the Lake Tahoe Basin, California-Nevada, a Guide for Planning”, Bailey, 1974.

•

Policy 2: No new land coverage or other permanent disturbance shall be permitted in Land Capability
Districts 1-3 except for those uses as noted in … B … below:
B. Public outdoor recreation facilities may be permitted in Land Capability Districts 1–3 if: (1) The
project is a necessary part of a public agency’s long range plans for public outdoor recreation; (2) The
project is consistent with the recreation element of the Regional Plan; (3) The project, by its very
nature must be sited in Land Capability Districts 1–3; (4) There is no feasible alternative which
avoids or reduces the extent of encroachment in Land Capability Districts 1–3; (5) The impacts are
fully mitigated; and (6) Land Capability Districts 1-3 lands are restored in the amount of 1.5 times the
area of Land Capability Districts 1–3 which is disturbed or developed beyond that permitted by the
Bailey coefficients. To the fullest extent possible, recreation facilities must be sited outside of Land
Capability Districts 1–3. However, the six-part test established by the policy allows encroachment of
these lands where such encroachment is essential for public outdoor recreation, and precautions are
taken to ensure that such lands are protected to the fullest extent possible. The restoration
requirements of this policy can be accomplished on-site or off-site, and shall be in lieu of any
coverage transfer or coverage mitigation provisions elsewhere in this Plan.

►

•

Policy 4: TRPA shall develop specific policies to limit land disturbance and reduce soil and water quality
impacts of disturbed areas. Like impervious surfaces, disturbed and compacted areas result in increased
soil loss and surface runoff. The Regional Plan sets policies designed to reduce existing surface
disturbance and avoid new disturbance (see Water Quality Subelement, Goal 1, Policies 2 and 3;
Vegetation Subelement, Goal 1, Policy 5). TRPA shall set guidelines defining “disturbance” and
determine what types of disturbed and compacted areas should be counted as impervious surfaces for
purposes of applying land coverage limits. Coverage limits shall not be applied so as to prevent
application of best management practices to existing disturbed areas.

•

Policy 6: Grading, filling, clearing of vegetation (which disturbs soil), or other disturbances of the soil are
prohibited during inclement weather and for the resulting period of time when the site is covered with
snow or is in a saturated, muddy, or unstable condition. Special regulations and construction techniques
will apply to all construction activities occurring between October 15 and May 1. Impacts related to soil
disturbance are highly exaggerated when the soil is wet. For precautionary reasons, all project sites must
be adequately winterized by October 15 as a condition for continued work on the site. Exceptions to the
grading prohibitions will be permitted in emergency situations where the grading is necessary for reasons
of public safety or for erosion control.

•

Policy 7: All existing natural functioning SEZs shall be retained as such and disturbed SEZs shall be
restored whenever possible. Stream environment zones shall be managed to perpetuate their various
functional roles, especially pertaining to water cleansing and nutrient trapment. This requires enforcement
of a non-degradation philosophy. This policy is common to the Water Quality, Vegetation, Stream
Environment Zone, and Wildlife Subelements and will be implemented through the Land Use Element
and capital improvements program.

Stream Environment Zone, Goal 1: Provide for the Long-Term Preservation and Restoration of
Stream Environment Zones. The preservation of SEZs is a means for achieving numerous environmental
thresholds. Policies that promote their maintenance, protection, and restoration are listed below.

Land Capability and Coverage

•

Policy 1: Restore all disturbed stream environment zone lands in undeveloped, unsubdivided lands, and
restore 25 percent of the SEZ lands that have been disturbed, developed, or subdivided.

•

Policy 2: SEZ lands shall be protected and managed for their natural values. SEZ lands and associated
riparian vegetation are scarce in the Basin relative to other plant communities. Because SEZs provide
many beneficial functions (especially pertaining to water quality) only forest management practices,
stream improvement programs, and habitat restoration projects are permissible uses.

•

Policy 5: No new land coverage or other permanent land disturbance shall be permitted in stream
environment zones except for those uses as noted in A, C, and E below:
A. Public outdoor recreation facilities are permissible uses in stream environment zones if: (1) The
project is a necessary part of a public agency’s long range plans for public outdoor recreation; (2) The
project is consistent with the recreation element of the regional plan; (3) The project, by its very
nature, must be sited in a stream environment zone; (4) There is no feasible alternative which would
reduce the extent of encroachment in stream environment zones; (5) The impacts are fully mitigated;
(6) Stream environment zone lands are restored in the amount of 1.5 times the area of stream
environment zone which is disturbed or developed by the project. To the fullest extent possible,
recreation facilities must be sited outside of stream environment zones. Some recreation facilities,
such as river access points or stream crossings for hiking trails, by their very nature require some
encroachment of stream environment zones. However, the six-part test established by this policy
allows encroachment of SEZs where such encroachment is essential for public outdoor recreation and
precautions are taken to ensure that stream environment zones are protected to the fullest extent
possible. The restoration requirements of this policy can be accomplished on-site or off-site, and shall
be in lieu of any coverage transfer or coverage mitigation provisions elsewhere in this Plan.
B. Public service facilities are permissible uses in stream environment zones if: (1) The project is
necessary for public health, safety, or environmental protection; (2) There is no reasonable
alternative, including spans, which avoids or reduces the extent of encroachment in stream
environment zones; (3) The impacts are fully mitigated; and (4) Stream environment zone lands are
restored in the amount of 1.5 times the area of stream environment zone which is disturbed or
developed by the project. Development within stream environment zones is not consistent with the
goal of managing stream environment zones for their natural qualities and shall generally be
prohibited except under extraordinary circumstances involving public works. Each circumstance shall
be evaluated based on the conditions of this policy. The restoration requirements of this policy can be
accomplished on-site or off-site, and shall be in lieu of any coverage transfer or coverage mitigation
provisions elsewhere in this Plan.
C Projects which require access across stream environment zones to otherwise buildable sites are
permissible in SEZs if: (1) There is no reasonable alternative, which avoids or reduces the extent of
encroachment in the SEZ; (2) The impacts are fully mitigated; and (3) SEZ lands are restored in the
amount of 1.5 times the area of stream environment zone which is disturbed or developed by the
project. The restoration requirements can be accomplished on-site or off-site, and shall be in lieu of
any coverage transfer or coverage mitigation provisions elsewhere in this Plan.
E. Stream environment zone restoration projects and erosion control projects.

•

Policy 6: Replacement of existing coverage in stream environment zones may be permitted where the
project will reduce impacts on stream environment zones and will not impede restoration efforts. Existing
structures in stream environment zones may be repaired or rebuilt. Minor reconstruction may be permitted
so long as drainage improvements, protection of the stream environment zone from disturbances, or other
measures are carried out which provide a net benefit to the area’s capacity to serve as a naturally-

functioning stream environment zone. Major reconstruction or replacement may also be permitted if there
is a net benefit to the stream environment zone and if the replacement or reconstruction is consistent with
stream environment zone restoration programs (see Policy 1).
Code of Ordinances
The “Site Development” and “Resource Management and Protection” sections of the TRPA Code of Ordinances
(TRPA 2011, adopted 2012) contain the following chapters and sections with requirements applicable to the
proposed alternatives related to geology, soils, and land coverage:
►

►

►

►

►

►

►

Chapter 30, “Land Coverage,” regulates implementation of the land capability system, land capability
districts, land coverage, and transfer and mitigation of land coverage. Section 30.5 discusses prohibitions on
installation of new land coverage or other permanent disturbances within areas assigned to LCDs 1, 2, or 3
(see “Tahoe Regional Planning Agency Land Coverage Regulations” below for a discussion of LCDs).
Exceptions to these prohibitions exist for single-family dwellings that are subject to review under the
individual parcel evaluation system, qualifying public outdoor recreation facilities, and qualifying public
facilities (e.g., water quality control facilities, including erosion control projects; habitat restoration projects;
wetland rehabilitation projects; and SEZ restoration projects). Section 30.6 discusses exceptions for coverage
relocation requirements that allow for a 1:1 coverage relocation ratio for the Upper Truckee River and Marsh
Restoration Project. Further exceptions are related to bridges and boardwalks that may be accounted for at a
lesser coverage ratio requirement.
Section 33.3, “Grading Standards,” regulates excavation, filling, and clearing to avoid adverse effects related
to exposed soils, unstable earthworks, or groundwater interference. Section 33.3 specifically addresses
seasonal limitations, winterization techniques, discharge prohibitions, dust control, disposal of materials,
standards for cuts and fills, and excavation limitations.
Section 33.4, “Special Information Reports and Plans,” regulates the need for special investigations, reports,
and plans determined to be necessary by TRPA to protect against adverse effects from grading, including
potential effects on slope stability, groundwater or antiquities.
Section 33.5, “Grading and Construction Schedules,” regulates schedules for grading and construction when
those activities are anticipated to occur pursuant to a TRPA permit. Section 33.5.1 specifies, “For projects
presenting special problems with regard to project completion, site development, or water quality
management, such as crossings of stream environment zones, major earthworks, or major clearing projects,
TRPA may require, as a condition of approval, submittal and approval of project schedules prior to site
disturbance.”
Section 33.6, “Vegetation Protection during Construction,” regulates the requirements for protection of
vegetation and soil during construction activities. Section 33.6 specifically addresses protection of vegetation
not designated and approved for removal, limits on size, type, and location of equipment use, and revegetation
of disturbed areas.
Chapter 35, “Natural Hazard Standards,” regulates activities to prevent damage to property and protect public
health relating to natural hazards.
Section 60.4, “Best Management Practice Requirements,” sets forth the requirements for installation of best
management practices (BMPs) for the protection or restoration of water quality and attainment of minimum
discharge standards. BMPs, as described in the Handbook of Best Management Practices (Volume II of the
Lake Tahoe Basin Water Quality Management Plan), or equivalent practices approved by TRPA, will be
applied to all public and privately owned lands. In addition to the standard requirements of Section 60.4.6, the
project conditions of approval will list any other appropriate required BMPs to meet minimum discharge

standards. Construction in SEZs or Land Capability Districts 1–3, inclusive, normally will require special
conditions of approval because of the sensitivity of those areas to disturbance.
Cove East Litigation Settlement Agreement
Several parcels within the study area are included as part of a litigation settlement agreement. Coverage
allocations for these parcels, shown in Exhibit 3.6-1, replace the Bailey System in this defined portion of the study
area.
Article 5, Section 5.2 of the litigation settlement for the west side of the study area allocates 550,148 square feet
of “DilDev Net Coverage,” by total land area rather than by land capability district (People of the State of
California, ex rel. John K. Van de Kamp, Attorney General of the State of California v. Dillingham Development
Company and Tahoe Regional Planning Agency [Superior Court, County of El Dorado CIV-S-85-0873-EJG]).
441,963 square feet of the 550,148 is available on Conservancy property. Table 3.6-1 summarizes the assignment
of this coverage to parcels.

The settlement also sets the rules governing transfers of this coverage with respect to the settlement area (Section
5.3 of the settlement). The “settlement area,” defined in Exhibit 7 of the settlement, includes the above properties,
as well as properties owned by Tahoe Keys Property Owners Association (TKPOA) and the Conservancy’s
Parcel 1. The settlement provides for the transfer of coverage between parcels located in the settlement area,
through recordation of appropriate coverage transfer instruments, without further discretionary approvals (while
transfers of this “allowable” coverage to projects outside the settlement area must be carried out in conformance
with the Regional Plan).
Coverage changes proposed in these parcel use the values and transfer mechanisms defined in this litigation
settlement as described in the environmental consequences section below.
Land Capability Districts
Since 1972, TRPA has used the Bailey System (a land capability classification system) to evaluate applications
that request either additional impervious land coverage to existing developed lots or building permits for new
development (Bailey 1974). The Bailey System was developed to mitigate the deleterious effects on stream
systems and water quality that result from excessive coverage of land by impervious surfaces. The Bailey System
restricts the amount of impervious land coverage on all parcels and generally prohibits new land coverage in areas
classified as SEZ.

Land capability is defined as “the level of use an area can tolerate without sustaining permanent (environmental)
damage through erosion and other causes” (Bailey 1974). The Bailey system uses LCDs ranging from 1 to 7,
which assign a percentage of land coverage allowable in the designated LCD area (see Table 3.6-2).

LCDs were derived by analyzing the land capability according to frequency and magnitude of hazards that might
be encountered and by considering the type and intensity of uses suitable for each unit (Bailey 1974). Capability
classes are expressed as levels of tolerance that a unit can withstand without sustaining permanent damage
through erosion or other causes (i.e., water quality or land productivity). The integration of the LCDs and land use
suitability resulted in limits on land-surface modifications for each unit. The limits are expressed as a percentage
of each area that can be used for impervious coverage.
Chapter 90 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances defines land coverage as a human-made structure, improvement, or
covering that prevents normal precipitation from directly reaching the surface of the land underlying the structure,
improvement, or covering (TRPA 2008). Examples include roofs, decks, patios, and surfaces paved with asphalt,
concrete, or stone. Such structures are defined as “hard coverage.” Areas of compacted soils without structures are
defined as “soft coverage” (e.g., areas where parking of cars or heavy pedestrian traffic have compacted soils to
an extent that prevents substantial infiltration of water).
City of South Lake Tahoe
Chapter 36 of the City of South Lake Tahoe (CSLT) Code, Grading, Erosion, and Sediment Control Ordinance
was codified for the following purposes:
►

Regulating grading on both public and private property within the CSLT to safeguard life, limb, health,
property and public welfare;

►

To avoid pollution of watercourses with hazardous materials, nutrients, sediments, or other earthen materials
generated on or caused by surface runoff or by aerial deposition of pollutants generated from the permit area
on or across the permit area; and

►

To ensure that the intended use of a graded site is consistent with the CSLT general plan, any specific plans
adopted thereto and applicable CSLT ordinances including the zoning ordinance, flood damage prevention
ordinance, environmental review ordinance, and applicable chapters of the California Building Code.

In the event of conflict between these ordinances and state or federal law, these ordinances shall prevail unless
preempted by the state or federal law.
Unless in conflict with provisions of adopted general and/or specific plans, the following grading may be done
without obtaining a grading permit from the CSLT (only relevant grading activities are listed):
►

Grading activities governed and operating under permits issued by TRPA or Lahontan regional or state water
boards or Caltrans;

►

Stream restoration or alteration projects conducted under valid regional, state or federal permits, e.g., stream
alteration permits, water quality certifications, etc.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Regional Geology
The Tahoe Basin is located in the northern Sierra Nevada, between the Sierra crest to the west and the Carson
Range to the east. The Sierra Nevada is the most prominent mountain range in California, and in conjunction with
the Central Basin, forms part of the Sierra Nevada microplate, an element of the broad Pacific–North American
plate boundary (Argus and Gordon 1991). Before becoming part of the transform plate margin, the Sierra Nevada
was the site of a Cenozoic volcanic arc, with related deposits draping over pre-Cenozoic metamorphic and
plutonic rocks (Wakabayashi and Sawyer 2000:173). The general asymmetry of the Sierra Nevada reflects uplift
and gentle westward tilting, evidenced by the mountain range sloping gently westward and abruptly eastward
from its crest to west of the study area.
The Tahoe Basin was formed more than two million years ago by a combination of faulting and volcanism. As a
result, the basin contains a combination of granitic, metamorphic, and volcanic rock. The predominant bedrock in
the basin is Cretaceous granodiorite of the Sierra Nevada batholith. Cretaceous rock formed during the later
period of the Mesozoic Era, characterized by the development of flowering plants and ending with the sudden
extinction of dinosaurs and many other forms of life. Pre-Cretaceous metamorphic rocks are found in localized
areas. Over the past 1.5 million years, the Tahoe region has been altered by glacial activity. During this activity,
valley glaciers dammed the Truckee River Canyon, raising the water level of Lake Tahoe. Lacustrine sediments
were deposited in the bays and canyons around the lake as a result of the rising lake levels. The faulting, folding,
and in some cases overturning of rock formations that have taken place during various periods of geologic
activity, in combination with erosion, deposition, and subsequent cementation of rock materials that have
occurred during relatively quiet periods, have left a complex arrangement of geologic rock types and structures in
the area. However, the extraordinary clarity of Lake Tahoe is related to the prevalence of resistant granitic
bedrock in the Tahoe Basin and an unusually small drainage basin relative to the size of the lake.
Local Geology and Topography
The study area is located on the South Lake Tahoe, California, 7.5-minute U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle
map. Elevations are approximately 6,228–6,245 feet above mean sea level, and the study area slopes gently
toward the lake (to the north).

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Geology and Soils, Mineral Resources, and
Land Capability and Coverage

A review of the Geologic Map of the Lake Tahoe Basin indicates that most of the study area (approximately 80
percent) is composed of Holocene-age floodplain deposits, composed of silty sand and sandy to clayey silt
(Saucedo 2005). Approximately ten percent of the study area, immediately adjacent to and north of the Highland
Woods subdivision, is composed of Pleistocene-age lacustrine terrace deposits, composed of silt, sand, and gravel
and forming broad, low terraces at 16–32 feet above lake level. The remaining ten percent of the study area,
which includes the Lower West Side Restoration Area, is composed of late Holocene artificial fill, human-made
deposits of varying composition.
Seismicity
The potential for seismic activity at a given location is most often related to the proximity of faults, fractures, or
zones of closely associated fractures along which rocks on one side have been displaced with respect to those on
the other side. Most faults are the result of repeated displacement that can take place suddenly or by slow creep, or
both.
The study area is located along the southern shore of Lake Tahoe on a regionally significant down-faulted graben
(i.e., trench-like geologic feature), sometimes referred to as a half-graben. The study area is not located in an
Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone (California Geological Survey [CGS] 2005, Hart and Bryant 1999). The
nearest fault zoned under the Alquist-Priolo Act is near Minden, Nevada, approximately 20 miles from the study
area. The Geologic Map of the Lake Tahoe Basin, California and Nevada, shows that several faults mapped near
the study area (Saucedo 2005).The North Tahoe Fault, located beneath the lake, is a northeast-southwest trending
fault, approximately 7.0 miles long. The northeast-southwest trending Incline Village Fault zone appears to be the
landward extension of the submerged North Tahoe Fault and also trends northeast toward the Truckee Meadows
Fault. All three of these faults may be part of a system of normal faults that rupture together. Evidence indicates
that an earthquake may have occurred along the Incline Village Fault as recently as 500 years ago, and all three
faults are estimated to be capable of generating an earthquake of magnitude 7.0 (Seitz and Kent 2004).
The East Tahoe Fault, much of which is also located under Lake Tahoe, is inferred to bound the east margin of the
basin (Sawyer 1999). The fault shows bedding terminating against a planar west-dipping bedrock surface,
suggesting young movement. Recent bathymetry of Lake Tahoe reveals that the escarpment is deeply dissected,
has an irregular base, and is partly buried at the base by well-developed sediment aprons. The subaqueous fault
has probably been modified by the deposition of thick debris avalanche deposits, appearing to have accumulated
against the eastern basin escarpment after one or more very large debris avalanches that initiated on the west wall
of the basin. Schweickert et al. (2000) speculated that at least one megalandslide on the west side of the basin was
triggered by a Holocene faulting event. No evidence has been reported that the East Tahoe Fault displaces
Quaternary deposits on the north or south shores of the lake.
The north-south trending West Tahoe-Dollar Point Fault zone is another prominent normal slip fault zone in the
Tahoe Basin (Ichinose et al. 1999). The West Tahoe Fault is submerged from Emerald Bay to McKinney Bay.
The Dollar Point Fault is the northern continuation of the West Tahoe Fault northward from McKinney Bay. Both
of these faults are likely to rupture together.
According to the Earthquake Potential Map for Portions of Eastern California and Western Nevada, the Tahoe
area is considered to have a relatively low to moderate potential for shaking caused by seismic-related activity
(CGS 2005).
Estimates of the peak ground acceleration have been made for the Tahoe Basin based on probabilistic models that
account for multiple seismic sources. Under these models, consideration of the probability of expected seismic
events is incorporated into the determination of the level of ground shaking at a particular location. The CGS has
estimated the expected peak horizontal acceleration (with a ten percent chance of being exceeded in the next 50
years) generated by any of the seismic sources potentially affecting the study area as 0.275. (CGS 2003). The
Nevada Seismological Laboratory catalog lists eight earthquakes with Richter magnitudes (M) of 4.2 or greater

that have occurred since 1950, within approximately 18 miles of the center of Lake Tahoe. These include an M
4.5 earthquake (at Tahoe Vista, approximately 40 miles northwest of the study area) on June 3, 2004. The 2004
event has been attributed to an increase in upper crustal seismicity following a deep dike swarm of 1,611
earthquakes in the Tahoe Vista area, at the site of a deep magma injection event beneath Lake Tahoe (Smith et al.
2004:1278).
Minerals
The study area does not contain any state-designated Mineral Resources Zones, according to maps prepared by
the State Mining and Geology Board (Busch 2001). The site is underlain by silt, silty sand, sandy to clayey silt,
sand and gravel, and artificial fill of varying composition. No economically viable deposits of clean sand or gravel
exist that would be useful to extract for riprap, aggregate, or other industrial uses.
Soils
Soil profile formation within the study area is a result of the interplay of geomorphic and hydrologic processes,
vegetation, and in situ chemical processes. A significant amount of heterogeneity exists within the study area
because of these processes, and the general trends are described below.
The following descriptions are qualitative summaries of soil types based on the Soil Survey for the Lake Tahoe
Basin Area (NRCS 2007).

Beaches—This soil type is located at the shoreline area of Lake Tahoe and consists of shallow fine gravels,
coarse gravels, and cobbles. The soils have rapid permeability, low shrink-swell potential, and very low water
capacity. The erosion hazard is slight, and this soil type has limitations for roads and excavations.
Tahoe Complex, 0 to 2 percent slopes—This soil type is located in the southern part of the Tahoe Basin, within
flood plains and valley flats. Soils consist of mucky silt loam, gravelly coarse sand, loam, sandy loam, and loamy
sand. This soil type is subject to flooding, is naturally poorly drained, has low shrink-swell potential, and has a
very high runoff potential. This soil type has limitations for road construction, excavations, and dwellings.
Tahoe Complex, 0 to 5 percent slopes, gravelly—This soil type is located in riparian corridors all around the
Tahoe Basin, within flood plains and valley flats. The soils are derived from granitic and volcanic parent material
and consist of mucky gravelly silt loam, gravelly loam, gravelly loamy fine sand, and gravelly fine sand. This soil
type is occasionally subject to flooding, is naturally poorly drained with moderate permeability, has low shrinkswell potential, and has a very high runoff potential. This soil type has limitations for road construction,
excavation, and dwellings.
Tahoe mucky silt loam, drained, 0 to 5 percent slopes—This soil type is located in the southern part of the
Tahoe Basin, within floodplains and valley flats. The soils are derived from granitic and volcanic parent material
and consist of mucky silt, loam, loamy fine sand, and fine sand. This soil type occasionally is subject to flooding,
is very poorly drained with moderate permeability, has low shrink-swell potential, and has a very high runoff
potential. This soil type has limitations for road construction, excavation, and dwellings.

Oxyaquic Xerorthents-Water association, 0 to 5 percent slopes—This soil type is located in the Tahoe Keys
and consists of marshland fill. The fill material is derived from granodiorite parent material and consists of very
gravelly coarse sand, mucky silt loam, mucky silt loam, gravelly coarse sand, and mucky silt loam. This soil type
typically is subject to flooding, is well drained with slow permeability, has low shrink-swell potential, and has a
high runoff potential. This soil type has limitations for excavation and dwellings.
Watah peat, 0 to 2 percent slopes—This soil type is located in the southern part of the Tahoe Basin, in fens,
flood plains, and valley flats. Soils consist of peat, mucky peat, mucky gravelly coarse sandy loam, and gravelly
loamy coarse sand. The soil has moderate permeability, has low shrink-swell potential, is very poorly drained, and
has very high surface runoff potential. Flooding and ponding occur frequently in this soil type. It has limitations
for road construction, excavation, and dwellings.
Christopher-Gefo complex, 0 to 5 percent slopes—This soil type is located in the southern part of the Tahoe
Basin, within hill slopes and outwash terraces. The soils consist of loamy coarse sand to gravelly loamy coarse
sand. The soil has moderate permeability, has low shrink-swell potential, is very poorly drained, and has very
high surface runoff potential. Flooding and ponding occur frequently in this soil type. The wind erosion hazard is
moderate. This soil type has limitations for excavations.
Marla loamy coarse sand, 0 to 5 percent slopes—This soil type is located in the southern part of the Tahoe
Basin, in outwash terraces and valley flats. Soils consist of loamy coarse sand, clay loam, stratified sandy loam,
and fine sandy loam. The soil has slow permeability, has low shrink-swell potential, is poorly drained, and has
very high surface runoff potential. Flooding is rare but ponding does occur in this soil type. The wind erosion
hazard is moderate. This soil type has limitations for road construction, excavations, and dwellings.
Land Capability and Existing Coverage
The majority of the study area has been verified as LCD 1b. There is a small area on the west edge of the study
area within LCD 6 and several small areas within LCD 7 along the eastern and southern study area boundary
(Exhibit 3.6-2). Table 3.6-3 presents the distribution of land coverage area in the study area within each land class
as verified in the TRPA Verification of August 28, 2008. The table also shows coverage allowed within each land
class. Allowable land coverage on Parcels 3, 4, and 5 is not based on land class but instead based on a litigation
settlement agreement in People of the State of California vs. Dillingham Development Company and TRPA CIVS-85-0873-EJG (1988) as described in the regulatory section above and summarized in Table 3.6-1.
Existing coverage within the study area includes a user-created network of trails (see Section 3.13, “Recreation,”
for additional discussion on trails within the study area), a few small discrete sites, and the TKPOA Corporation
Yard, most of which is located within LCD 1b. The TKPOA Corporation Yard and associated entrance consists of
a compacted fill and gravel base. Two outbuildings are located within the yard. Most trails within the study area
consist of compacted native soil, vary in width and length, and are not maintained as designated trails, with the
exception of the trail at the Lower West Side restoration area. The Lower West Side trail is composed of
compacted decomposed granite and is maintained by the Conservancy.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES AND MITIGATION MEASURES

SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA
For this analysis, significance criteria are based on the checklist presented in Appendix G of the State CEQA
Guidelines; the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist; factual or scientific information and data; and regulatory
standards of Federal, State, and local agencies. These criteria also encompass the factors taken into account under
NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and intensity of its effects.

Allowable coverage is based on a litigation settlement agreement in People of the State of California vs. Dillingham Development Company
and TRPA CIV-S-85-0873-EJG (February 25, 1988). The coverage allowed on Parcels 3, 4, and 5 is a combined total that can be used on
any of the parcels.

Other Parcels includes all parcels outside of parcels 3, 4 and 5 within the study area. No coverage changes are proposed for private
parcels under any alternatives.
Source: Data compiled by AECOM from TRPA 2008 coverage verification and litigation settlement agreement referenced above.

CEQA Criteria
Under CEQA, an alternative was determined to result in a significant effect related to geology, soils, or mineral
resources if it would:
►

expose people or structures to potential substantial adverse effects including loss or injury from seismic
hazards, including earthquake, fault rupture, strong seismic ground shaking, liquefaction, or landslides
(CEQA 1);

►

result in substantial soil erosion or loss of topsoil (CEQA 2);

►

be located on a geologic unit that is unstable or would become unstable as a result of the project (CEQA 3);

►

be located on expansive soil (CEQA 4);

►

have soils incapable of adequately supporting the use of septic tanks or alternative wastewater disposal
systems where sewers are not available (CEQA 5);

►

result in the loss of availability of known mineral resources that would be of future value to the State or the
region (CEQA 6); or

►

would directly or indirectly destroy a unique paleontological resource or site (CEQA 7). An individual
vertebrate fossil specimen may be considered unique or significant if it is identifiable and well preserved, and
it meets one of the following criteria:
•

a type specimen (i.e., the individual from which a species or subspecies has been described);

•

a member of a rare species;

•

a species that is part of a diverse assemblage (i.e., a site where more than one fossil has been discovered)
wherein other species are also identifiable, and important information regarding life history of individuals
can be drawn;

•

a skeletal element different from, or a specimen more complete than, those now available for its species; or

•

a complete specimen (i.e., all or substantially all of the entire skeleton is present).

NEPA Criteria
An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the
environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the proposed action. Under NEPA, the significance
of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account
under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are
encompassed by the CEQA criteria used for this analysis. NEPA requires documentation and discussion of any
beneficial effects of a project in addition to its negative impacts. Where appropriate, these beneficial effects are
discussed and called out specifically for the purposes of NEPA in the following impact analysis.
TRPA Criteria
The TRPA Land Classification System (Tables 3.6-2 and 3.6-3) is used to analyze potential impacts on sensitive
slope, soils, and drainage conditions. Significance criteria used in the analysis of land coverage relate directly to
the TRPA Land Classification System and coverage requirements as well as the litigation settlement agreement in
People of the State of California vs. Dillingham Development Company and TRPA CIV-S-85-0873-EJG (1988) as
described in the regulatory section above.
Based on TRPA’s Initial Environmental Checklist, an alternative would result in a significant impact on geology,
soils, and coverage if it would:
►

result in a change in the topographic features of the site inconsistent with the natural surrounding conditions
(TRPA 1);

►

change the undisturbed soil or native geologic substructures or grading in excess of five feet (TRPA 2);

►

continue or increase wind or water erosion of soils (TRPA 3);

►

result in changes in siltation, deposition, or erosion that could modify the channel of a river or stream or the
bed of a lake (TRPA 4);

►

compact or cover soil with impervious surfaces beyond the limits allowed in the land capability districts
(TRPA 5);

►

expose people or property to seismic hazards such as earthquakes, landslides, backshore erosion, avalanches,
mud slides, ground failure, or similar hazards (TRPA 6); or

►

be located on a geologic unit or soil that is unstable or that would become unstable as a result of the project, and
potentially result in on- or off-site landslide, lateral spreading, subsidence, liquefaction, or collapse (TRPA 7).

Geologic hazards, as defined in this section, relate to seismic activity and may include surface fault rupture,
strong seismic ground shaking, liquefaction, subsidence, landslides, tsunami, and seiche potential. Tsunami and
seiches are addressed in Section 3.8, “Hydrology and Flooding.” Nonseismic geologic hazards are discussed with
regard to potential impacts on the alteration of the land surface (naturally or through human actions), including
grading, deposition or erosion, landslides, avalanche, or any effects that are because of or that may alter soil
properties or geotechnical issues. Although landslides, mudslides, avalanches, and other geomorphological events
can be triggered by seismic activity, such activity is not necessarily a prerequisite. Therefore, they are addressed
separately unless site-specific conditions warrant otherwise.
Although not used as significance criteria, effects on TRPA thresholds were evaluated and these effects are
reported in Section 4.5, “Consequences for Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities.” In development of
mitigation measures for significant impacts of the project, effects on environmental thresholds of the Tahoe
Regional Planning Compact were considered.

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
Impacts associated with geology, soils, mineral resources, and coverage that could result from project
construction and operational activities were evaluated qualitatively based on expected construction practices,
materials, and locations and the duration of project construction and related activities; relevant site-specific
reports; a field visit; the alternatives description in Chapter 2, “Project Alternatives”; and a review of published
geologic literature, including maps, books, and journal articles.
The impact analysis for earth resources also relies on information and analysis provided in Section 3.8,
“Hydrology and Flooding” and Section 3.9, “Geomorphology and Water Quality.” As discussed in Section 3.9,
“Geomorphology and Water Quality,” potential violations of the narrative turbidity standard, while considered a
significant impact for CEQA/NEPA/TRPA analysis for the water quality discussion in this document, would not
necessarily correspond to an adverse effect on beneficial uses. This is also true for effects on soils. Turbidity
levels would also likely need to exceed the minimum aesthetic criterion to have adverse effects on soils. A finding
of a significant unavoidable water quality impact does automatically correspond to an adverse condition on soils,
because impairment of related beneficial uses would likely require the proposed project to elevate turbidity levels
considerably more than ten percent above background for a larger magnitude and longer duration beyond the
limited area and brief period used for the water quality analysis.
The 2008 verified TRPA coverage information and the TRPA Land Classification System (Tables 3.6-2 and
3.6-3) and coverage requirements required under the Bailey System or outlined in the Cove East litigation
Settlement Agreement were used to analyze potential impacts on coverage, soils, and sensitive slopes. For each
alternative, the anticipated change in coverage was calculated by subtracting from existing coverage the square
footage that would be restored to pervious surface, and adding the square footage of impervious surface
associated with the restoration, recreation infrastructure, and public access elements of that alternative. Coverage
by parcel and LCD of elements of each alternative is presented in Table 3.6-4, below. The TRPA Code of
Ordinances Section 20.5 discusses exceptions for coverage relocation requirements that allow for a 1:1 coverage
relocation ratio for the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project. This 1:1 ratio was used in evaluating
potential project related impacts. Additional exceptions are related to bridges and boardwalks that may be
accounted for at a lesser coverage ratio requirement. These were not used to evaluate impacts; therefore coverage
impacts may be less than values presented in the discussion below.

For a detailed description of the elements of each alternative, see Chapter 2, “Project Alternatives,” which
provides the dimensions of the elements in Tables 2-3 and 2-4. It is noted that additional coverage verifications
were completed in 1992 and 1996 for this analysis the 2008 verification superseded the previous verifications and
is used in determining potential impacts.
The earth resources–related environmental consequences of implementing the proposed alternatives were
determined from a comparison with existing conditions, which are also embodied in Alternative 5, the No Project/
No Action Alternative. Mitigation is identified for all potential impacts. The proposed mitigation meets CEQA,
NEPA, and TRPA requirements by reducing earth resources–related impacts to a less-than-significant level when
feasible.
Hydrologic implications of seiches and tsunamis are discussed in Section 3.8, “Hydrology and Flooding.”

EFFECTS NOT DISCUSSED FURTHER IN THIS EIR/EIS/EIS
Risks to People or Structures Caused by Surface Fault Rupture (CEQA 1) – The study area is located
approximately 20 miles from the nearest Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone, and the project site is not
underlain by or adjacent to any known faults. Because the damage from surface fault rupture is generally limited
to a linear zone a few yards wide, the potential for surface fault rupture to cause damage to proposed structures is
negligible.
Landslide (CEQA 1) – A landslide or mudslide is the downhill movement of earth material under the force of
gravity. The factors contributing to landslide potential are steep slopes, unstable terrain, and proximity to
earthquake faults. The project site is relatively level and does not contain any steep slopes; therefore, it is not
subject to landsliding and there would be no impact.
Expansive Soils (CEQA 4) – Based on a review of NRCS soil survey data discussed above, the entire study area
is underlain by soils with low shrink-swell potential, indicating the soils are not expansive as defined in Table 181-B of the Uniform Building Code. Because construction would occur on soils with low shrink-swell potential,
there would be no risk to life or property related to construction on expansive soils.
Septic systems (CEQA 5) – The project alternatives do not include and would not use septic tanks or alternative
wastewater disposal systems. Therefore, there would be no impact.
Mineral resources (CEQA 6) – The MRZ designation provided by the CGS, coupled with the site-specific
geologic and soils data indicate that there are no significant mineral deposits at the project site. Therefore, there
would be no impact.
Damage or Destruction of Unique Paleontological Resources (CEQA 7) – The study area is underlain by
Holocene-age artificial fill and basin deposits, which are not considered to be paleontologically sensitive rock
formations. Therefore, there would be no impact related to damage or destruction of unique paleontological
resources.
Avalanche Potential (TRPA 7) – An avalanche is a rapid flow of snow down a slope, from either natural triggers
or human activity, typically occurring in mountainous terrain. For a slope to generate an avalanche it must be
simultaneously capable of retaining snow and allowing snow to accelerate after it is set in motion. The study area
is located in a flat marsh and is therefore not susceptible to avalanches. Therefore, implementing any of the
project alternatives would have no effect on life and property related to avalanches.

IMPACT ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
Alternative 1: Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
IMPACT
3.6-1
(Alt. 1)

Soil Erosion, Sedimentation, and Loss of Topsoil. (CEQA 2, 3; TRPA 2, 3, 4) The topography, soils,
vegetation, and drainage within the study area would be modified by restoration activities, public access, and
recreation infrastructure planned under Alternative 1. Public access and recreation infrastructure would
emphasize habitat protection by directing continued use and discouraging access to sensitive areas that are
presently used by the public. Long-term conditions related to erosion, sedimentation, and loss of top soil would
be improved with implementation of Alternative 1. Short-term exposure of soils to potential wind and water
erosion would be protected through implementation of Environmental Commitments 5, 6, and 8. This impact
would be less than significant.

Existing user-created trails and other disturbed surfaces would be modified under Alternative 1. Defined paths,
viewpoints, and signage, would emphasize habitat protection by directing continued use, and discouraging access
to sensitive areas that have greater potential to be affected by disturbance. Implementing Alternative 1 would have
a long-term beneficial effect by restoring some sensitive areas that are disturbed and/or compacted and limiting
infiltration under the existing conditions.
Implementing Alternative 1 would require approximately four years of seasonal construction (between May 1 and
October 15), with winter closedowns, except for BMP maintenance and monitoring. Construction would disturb
areas in uplands, as well as in the active and 100-year floodplain and the main channels of the Upper Truckee
River and Trout Creek. The extent of in-channel work would vary by year (see Alternative 1 construction
schedule section in Section 2.6.2). Bridge installation, boat launch, lagoon construction, grade controls, bank
protection measures, and transition connections would require work in the active channel. Floodplain
reconstruction, paths, and most recreation components would be completed outside of the existing active channel.
Nearly all of the disturbance areas, access routes, and staging areas would be within the 100-year floodplain (see
Exhibit 3.8-14).
Implementing Alternative 1 would include implementing Environmental Commitment (EC) 5, “Prepare and
Implement Effective Construction Site Management Plans to Minimize Risks of Water Quality Degradation and
Impacts to Vegetation”; EC 6, “Obtain and Comply with Federal, State, Regional, and Local Permits”; and EC 8,
“Prepare a Final Geotechnical Engineering Report, and Implement All Applicable Recommendations”
(Table 2-6). Implementing these environmental commitments is expected to minimize vegetation removal and
minimize the loss of topsoil and the need to import topsoil into the study area.
Implementing EC 5 would involve salvaging, reusing, and protecting on-site resources (e.g., willows) where
possible. Efforts would be made to work as quickly as possible to move from initial disturbance through final
revegetation throughout the study area. It is expected that disturbed areas would be exposed to winter conditions
between summer construction seasons. Winterization protection could be needed throughout the construction
zone, and possible overwinter use of staging, storage, or access areas may be necessary. All temporary stormwater
controls and/or overwinter flood flow protections would be designed and sized to meet regulatory requirements
but could be overwhelmed by a larger event if it occurred during the construction period. However, the
probability of an event of greater magnitude occurring during either the summer low-flow seasons or the couple
of intervening winters is low.
As described in EC 6, the Conservancy would obtain permits and approvals from several entities (e.g., El Dorado
County, CSLT, TRPA, Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and
California Department of Fish and Game) that would impose conditions and requirements to minimize
construction risks of water quality degradation by sediment or other pollutants. Although the general types of
permit documents and their components are known, the specific measures, performance standards, and

enforcement elements would not be established until the time of acquisition. Several general construction
management measures would be implemented to minimize environmental impacts, along with specific measures
to control wind- and water-related erosion and to protect water quality (see Chapter 2, “Project Alternatives”).
Exact erosion control measures (BMPs) or their performance standards are not specified at this time, but general
BMPs would likely include use of construction fencing, silt fences, hay bales, temporary settling basins,
vegetation protection, hydroseeding, and straw mulch. Construction activities that require access to the existing
streambed or streambanks would require temporary dewatering of surface water in the river channel, and, where
subsurface access is needed, temporary dewatering/pumping of groundwater that seeps into the work area may
also be required. Conceptual approaches to dewatering have been identified for various elements of Alternative 1
in-channel work, but specific measures have not yet been determined (see Section 2.6.2, “Construction Activities
and Schedule” for dewatering approaches.)
A geotechnical report would be prepared, and applicable recommendations from the report would be implemented
as part of EC 8.
Based on the conceptual information regarding proposed construction management and ECs 5, 6, and 8
(Table 2-6), erosion, sedimentation, and loss of topsoil would be minimized. This impact would be less than
significant.
IMPACT

(Alt. 1)

Risks to People and Structures Caused by Strong Seismic Ground Shaking. (CEQA 1, 3; TRPA 6, 7)
Potentially active faults in the project vicinity could subject recreational users within the study area to damage
from strong seismic ground shaking. However, project components would be designed in accordance with the
CSLT and County codes as required by law. Alternative 1 would not expose additional people to geologic
hazards. This impact would be less than significant.

Potentially active faults that are closest to the study area include the Genoa Fault and the Tahoe Valley Fault. The
Genoa Fault is located approximately 20 miles east of the study area, and is capable of generating an earthquake
of magnitude 7.4. The Tahoe Valley Fault Zone surrounds the study area to the north, west, and south. This
Quaternary fault has a slip rate of <0.2 millimeter per year. Other fault zones in the Basin, including the North
Tahoe and West Tahoe-Dollar Point, also may pose a hazard for strong seismic ground shaking in the project
vicinity. The action alternatives would include construction of public access features, a parking lot, and a structure
over the Upper Truckee River. The project does not include any buildings intended for human occupation. The
project components would be designed and constructed in accordance with the CSLT’s and County’s seismic
standards designed to reduce the risk of injury or property damage from seismic hazards, including strong ground
shaking.
Alternative 1 would be constructed in soil types composed of loamy and gravelly sands, which have an extremely
low shrink/swell potential. No previous landslides have been mapped in the project vicinity. The elevation in the
study area is nearly level, and the public access and recreation infrastructure would be constructed to follow the
existing natural contours to the extent feasible. Therefore, project construction would not result in the creation of
unstable slopes that would subject recreational users to an increased hazard.
Soil liquefaction occurs when ground shaking from an earthquake causes a sediment layer saturated with
groundwater to lose strength and take on the characteristics of a fluid, thus becoming similar to quicksand. Factors
determining the liquefaction potential are soil type, the level and duration of seismic ground motions, the type and
consistency of soils, and the depth to groundwater. Liquefaction poses a hazard to engineered structures. The loss
of soil strength can result in bearing capacity insufficient to support foundation loads, increased lateral pressure
on retaining walls, and slope instability. Based on a review of soil types associated with project facilities, it is
possible that liquefaction could occur in the event of a large magnitude earthquake on one of the potentially active
faults in the Lake Tahoe Basin. However, the project components would be designed and constructed in

accordance with CSLT and County design requirements (as required by law) that are intended to reduce the risk
of injury or property damage from seismic hazards, including strong ground shaking.
Ichinose et al. (1999) show through simulations modeling wave propagation for various earthquake scenarios that
if a large earthquake were to occur (approximately magnitude 7.0), a potential exists for both tsunami and seicherelated waves up to 30 feet to occur along the shore of Lake Tahoe. However, the project components would be
constructed in an area that already has urban development and recreational facilities, including residential housing
and a marina, and users of the public access facilities are expected to be people who already reside or recreate in
the Tahoe Basin; therefore, construction of the proposed improvements would not create a situation that exposes
additional people to tsunami hazards. Furthermore, there is no way of knowing whether or not a tsunami with
enough force to damage project improvements or to present a safety hazard to recreational users would ever be
generated during the lifetime of the project facilities. This impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.6-3
(Alt. 1)

Changes in Land Coverage. (TRPA 5) Alternative 1 would involve removing and relocating land coverage in
the study area. Existing coverage in the TKPOA Corporation Yard and a user-created trail network would be
restored to permeable surfaces, and new public access infrastructure and parking would be created. Proposed
land coverage in the study area on Parcels 3, 4, and 5 (defined by the Dillingham Settlement Agreement) under
Alternative 1 would consist of approximately 63,406 – 73,676 square feet, which is significantly less than the
total allowable coverage of 441,963 square feet. Proposed land coverage on all other parcels in the study area
(regulated by the Bailey’s System) would be 76,687–95,311 square feet in LCD 1b, and 26,426–32,638 square
feet in LCD 7, which is well within the allowable coverage of 194,977 and 284,069 square feet for each LCD,
respectively. Coverage relocation would be completed at a 1:1 ratio for the other parcels outside of the litigation
parcels as allowed by the TRPA Code of Ordinances. Coverage relocation would be in compliance with
Dillingham Settlement Agreement and as allowed by the TRPA Code of Ordinances. This impact would be less
than significant.

The public access infrastructure and enhancement elements of Alternative 1 (the maximum recreation alternative)
would involve removing and relocating land coverage in the study area (Table 3.6-5). This coverage would be
concentrated around the perimeter of the study area, in LCDs 1b and 7. The restoration and enhancement elements
of Alternative 1 would remove coverage associated with the TKPOA Corporation Yard. They also would remove
coverage associated with a user-created network of trails currently found generally around the study area’s
perimeter and in much of the interior of the eastern half of the study area around Trout Creek (Exhibit 3.6-2). In
general, coverage would be designed to reduce existing effects on sensitive resources, and/or would be situated in
less-sensitive locations than the existing user-created trails that would be removed.
New coverage under Alternative 1 would include a parking area, bridge, boardwalk, and bike and pedestrian trails
with observation areas and viewpoints. Coverage is typically regulated by Bailey’s LCDs but because of the
Dillingham Settlement Agreement (reference) coverage on portions of this study area is legally determined, while
other portions are regulated by the typical methods.
In this case, Parcels 3, 4, and 5 (map reference) of the settlement agreement is allowed a total coverage amount of
441,963 regardless of parcel boundaries. The project would remove 140,190 square feet of verified coverage and
add 63,406 – 73,676, depending on widths of trails. This is significantly less than the existing verified coverage
and significantly less than the total allowed coverage of 441,963.
For all other parcels in the study area there are two LCD’s, 1b and 7, in which coverage is proposed to be
relocated. For LCD 1b, 60,745 square feet of verified coverage (volunteer trails restored) would be removed
(Table 3.6-4) while 76,687–95,311 square feet (depending on trail widths) would be added. While this would
increase the coverage by 15,942 – 34,566 square feet, it is significantly less than the allowed coverage of 194,977
square feet (Table 3.6-3). For LCD 7, 13,006 square feet of verified coverage (volunteer trails restored) would be
removed (Table 3.6-4) while 26,426–32,638 square feet (depending on trail widths) would be added. While this

284,069 square feet (Table 3.6-3). Coverage relocation would be completed at a 1:1 ratio for the other parcels
outside of the litigation parcels as allowed by the TRPA Code of Ordinances. Because the coverage proposed
under Alternative 1 is consistent with the Dillingham Settlement Agreement and the TRPA Code of Ordinances
and within the amount allowed in the study area, this impact would be less than significant.

and public access and recreation infrastructure features. Public access elements emphasize habitat protection
that will limit erosion compared to existing conditions by directing and managing continued use, and
discouraging access to sensitive areas that are presently used by the public. Long-term conditions related to

Changes in Land Coverage. (TRPA 5) Alternative 2 would involve removing and relocating land coverage in
the study area. Existing coverage in the TKPOA Corporation Yard and a user-created trail network would be
restored to permeable surfaces, and new public access infrastructure would be created. Proposed land
coverage in the study area on Parcels 3, 4, and 5 (defined by the Dillingham Settlement Agreement) under
Alternative 2 would consist of approximately 33,562 – 46,398 square feet, which is significantly less than the
total allowable coverage of 441,963 square feet. Proposed land coverage on all other parcels in the study area
(regulated by the Bailey’s System) would be 2,536 – 2,804 square feet in LCD 1b, and 1,076 – 1,614 square
feet in LCD 7, which is well within the allowable coverage of 194,977 and 284,069 square feet respectively.
Coverage relocation would be completed at a 1:1 ratio for the other parcels outside of the litigation parcels as
allowed by the TRPA Code of Ordinances. Coverage relocation would be in compliance with Dillingham
Settlement Agreement and as allowed by the TRPA Code of Ordinances. Additionally, due to the overall
reduction in coverage this impact would be beneficial.

The public access infrastructure and enhancement elements of Alternative 2 (the minimum recreation alternative)
would involve removing and relocating land coverage in the study area (Table 3.6-5). This coverage would be
concentrated around the perimeter of the study area, in LCDs 1b and 7. The restoration and enhancement elements

general, coverage would be designed to reduce existing effects on sensitive resources, and/or would be situated in
less-sensitive locations than the existing user-created trails that would be removed.
New coverage under Alternative 2 would include pedestrian trails, observation areas, a fishing platform, and a
small boardwalk. Coverage is typically regulated by Bailey’s LCDs but because of the Dillingham Settlement
Agreement (1988), coverage on portions of this study area are legally determined, while other portions are
regulated by the typical methods.
In this case as defined by the Settlement Agreement, parcels 3, 4, and 5 are allowed a total coverage amount of
441,963 regardless of parcel boundaries. The project would remove 140,190 square feet of verified coverage and
add 33,562 – 46,398, depending on widths of trails. This is significantly less than the existing verified coverage

Creek (Exhibit 3.6-2). In general, created coverage would be designed to reduce existing effects on sensitive
resources, and/or would be situated in less-sensitive locations than the existing user-created trails that would be

The proposed coverage would include trails, viewpoints, and boardwalks. Coverage is typically regulated by
Bailey’s Land Capability Districts but because of the Dillingham Settlement Agreement (1988) coverage on
portions of this study area are legally determined, while other portions are regulated by the typical methods.
In this case, Parcels 3, 4, and 5 (map reference) of the Settlement Agreement is allowed a total coverage amount
of 441,963 regardless of parcel boundaries. The project would remove 54,624 square feet of verified coverage and
add 37,500 – 76,622 square feet (depending on widths of trails). Although this could result in an increase in
coverage it still would be significantly less than the total allowed coverage of 441,963.
For all other parcels in the study area there are two LCD’s, 1b and 7, in which coverage is proposed to be
relocated. For LCD 1b, 60,745 square feet of verified coverage (volunteer trails restored) would be removed
(Table 3.6-4) while 11,133 – 15,151 square feet (depending on trail widths) would be added. This would reduce
coverage by 49,612 – 45,594 square feet and is significantly less than the allowed coverage of 194,977 square feet
(Table 3.6-3). For LCD 7, 13,006 square feet of verified coverage (volunteer trails restored) would be removed
(Table 3.6-4) while 21,642 – 23,160 square feet (depending on trail widths) would be added. While this would
increase coverage by 8,636 – 10,154 square feet it is significantly less than the allowed coverage of 284,069
square feet (Table 3.6-3). Unlike Alternatives 1–3, Alternative 4 would not remove coverage from the TKPOA
Corporation Yard. Consequently, the overall reduction in coverage would be less. Coverage relocation would be
completed at a 1:1 ratio for the other parcels outside of the litigation parcels as allowed by the TRPA Code of

sedimentation and loss of topsoil would remain comparable to existing conditions and no additional soil
erosion, sedimentation, or loss of topsoil would occur as a result of construction activities. Thus, this impact
would be less than significant.

The topography, soils, vegetation, and drainage within the study area would not be modified under Alternative 5;
therefore, soil erosion, sedimentation, and loss of topsoil within the study area would be similar to existing
conditions. This impact would be less than significant.

Risks to People and Structures Caused by Strong Seismic Ground Shaking. (CEQA 1, 3; TRPA 6, 7)
Potentially active faults in the project vicinity could subject recreational users within the study area to damage
from strong seismic ground shaking. Under Alternative 5, there would be no construction of restoration,
recreation infrastructure, or public access features, so existing risks from strong seismic ground shaking
would continue. No additional risks from project activities would occur. Thus, no impact would occur.

No restoration, recreation infrastructure, or public access features would be constructed under Alternative 5;
therefore, this alternative would not increase risks to people or structures related to seismic ground shaking. No
impact would occur.

Changes in Land Coverage. (TRPA 5) Under Alternative 5, no construction of restoration, recreation
infrastructure, public access, or enhancement features would be completed. Existing coverage would
continue to include 140,190 square feet on Parcels 3, 4, and 5 (Dillingham Settlement Agreement). All other
parcels would continue to include 60,745 square feet in LCD 1b, and 13,006 square feet in LCD 6. This
impact would be less than significant.

No facilities or restoration activities would be constructed under Alternative 5; therefore, there would be no
changes to land coverage within the study area. Existing coverage would continue to include 140,190 square feet

Code of Ordinances
Section 61.3.6.D of the TRPA Code of Ordinances (adopted November 15, 2011, effective March 1, 2012)
(TRPA 2011) provides the following guidance related to hazards and hazardous materials that is applicable to the
project:
Vegetation Management to Prevent the Spread of Wildfire: Within areas of significant fire hazard, as
determined by local, state or federal fire agencies, flammable or other combustible vegetation shall be
removed, thinned, or manipulated in accordance with local and state law. Revegetation with approved
species or other means of erosion control may be required where vegetative ground cover has been
eliminated or where erosion problems may occur.
City of South Lake Tahoe
The Lake Tahoe Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) establishes planning boundaries for the Lake
Tahoe Airport and defines compatible types and patterns of future land uses that might occur in the area surround
the airport (CSLT 2007). The purpose of the CLUP is to provide the Lake Tahoe Airport area with compatibility
guidelines for height, noise, and safety.
The CLUP designates airport safety zones to the land surrounding the airport to minimize the number of people
exposed to aircraft crash hazards. This is accomplished by enforcing land use restrictions in the safety zones. The
CLUP designates three safety zones:
►

the clear zone, which is near the runway and is the most restrictive;

►

the approach/departure zone, which is located under the takeoff and landing slopes for each runway, extends
outward for 5,000 feet from Runway 36 (with a width of 500–1,500 feet) and 10,000 feet from Runway 18
(with a width of 1,010–3,500 feet), and is less restrictive than the clear zone; and

►

the overflight zone, which is the area overflown by aircraft during the normal traffic pattern, extends in all
directions 5,000 feet from the center of each end of each runway, and is the least restrictive.

The southeastern portion of the study area between the Highland Woods subdivision and Trout Creek is within the
approach/departure zone.
El Dorado County
El Dorado County Vector Control District
In 1915, the California Legislature adopted the Mosquito Abatement Act (now incorporated into the California
Health and Safety Code as Chapter 5 of Division 3), which formed the basis for the creation, function, and
governing powers of mosquito abatement districts. Mosquito abatement/vector control districts are local
governmental organizations responsible for controlling specific disease vectors within their jurisdictions. They are
authorized to conduct surveillance for vectors, prevent the occurrence of vectors, and abate production of vectors,
on both private and public properties. Vector control districts also review, comment, and make recommendations
regarding federal, state, or local land-use planning and environmental quality processes, documents, permits,
licenses, and entitlements for projects and their potential effects with respect to vector production.
These districts receive most of their revenue from property taxes and are primarily responsible for controlling
mosquitoes as pest species and as disease vectors. California law requires that if a problem source of mosquito
production exists as a result of human-made conditions, the party responsible for those conditions is liable for the
cost of abatement.

The El Dorado County Vector Control District (EDCVCD) was formed in 1963. EDCVCD is a division of the
Environmental Management Department of El Dorado County. EDCVCD’s service area encompasses 195 square
miles, including the study area. The mission of EDCVCD is to provide vector control services and protect the
public health and safety with minimal impact on the environment (EDCDEM 2012a).
El Dorado County Hazardous Materials Division
Chapter 8.40 of Title 8 of the El Dorado County Ordinance Code, Section 4332, requires any property owner with
an underground storage tank (UST) that contains hazardous materials to obtain a permit from EDCDEM.
Attachments A–D to Ordinance 4332 present requirements for construction activities surrounding USTs, as well
as sampling approach/analysis and closure requirements. General requirements for construction activities
surrounding a UST include erosion control, site safety, licensing requirements, and winter restrictions within the
Lake Tahoe Basin.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Hazardous Materials
Definitions
For purposes of this section, the term “hazardous materials” refers to both hazardous substances and hazardous
wastes. A hazardous material is defined by Federal regulations as “a substance or material that…is capable of
posing an unreasonable risk to health, safety, and property when transported in commerce” (49 CFR 171.8).
Section 25501 of the California Health and Safety Code defines a hazardous material as follows:
Hazardous material means any material that, because of its quantity, concentration, or physical, or
chemical characteristics, poses a significant present or potential hazard to human health and
safety or to the environment if released into the workplace or the environment. Hazardous
materials include, but are not limited to, hazardous substances, hazardous waste, and any material
which a handler or the administering agency has a reasonable basis for believing that it would be
injurious to the health and safety of persons or harmful to the environment if released into the
workplace or the environment.
Hazardous wastes are defined in Section 25141(b) of the California Health and Safety Code as wastes that:
…because of their quantity, concentration, or physical, chemical, or infectious characteristics,
[may either] cause, or significantly contribute to an increase in mortality or an increase in serious
illness[, or] pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment
when improperly treated, stored, transported, disposed of, or otherwise managed.
Potential Sources of Hazardous Materials in the Vicinity of the Study Area
The study area has been altered from its original condition as a result of human activities (logging; livestock
grazing; road construction; and residential, commercial, and industrial developments). Thus, human-generated,
hazardous wastes could exist within the study area. A search was performed by AECOM in 2008, and was
updated in 2012, of the Geotracker database (the State Water Resources Control Board [SWRCB] information
management system related to groundwater). Data relating to leaking underground storage tanks, and associated
cleanup activities, are part of the information that SWRCB is required to maintain under California Public
Resources Code (PRC) Section 65962.5 (i.e., the “Cortese List”). This search resulted in identification of three
leaking underground storage tanks and one other site designated as an “Other Water Board Cleanup Site” close to,
but not within the study area (SWRCB 2012). Exhibit 3.7-1 illustrates, and Table 3.7-1 lists, sites known by the
SWRCB to be close to the study area.

The Hazardous Waste and Substances Site List (i.e., the “EnviroStor” database) is maintained by the California
Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) as part of the requirements of PRC Section 65962.5. A search
of this list by AECOM in 2012 indicated that DTSC has no records of hazardous waste sites for South Lake
Tahoe (DTSC 2012).
There is one Superfund site within the South Lake Tahoe area: the Meyers Landfill, located on Forest Road No.
1204 (i.e., “Garbage Dump Road”) south of Pioneer Trail, approximately 2.5 miles south of the study area. The
Meyers Landfill was operated by El Dorado County under a Forest Service Special Use Permit from approximately 1955 to 1971. Groundwater beneath the landfill has been contaminated by water leaching through the
decomposing landfill waste. This has resulted in a groundwater contaminant plume that currently extends
approximately 1,600 feet downgradient (i.e., northeast) from the landfill. The primary contaminants of concern
are vinyl chloride (a carcinogen) and related volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The landfill itself has been
covered with a cap of clean soil and a geomembrane layer, along with drainage improvements, to prevent further
water infiltration through the landfill and into the groundwater. A series of groundwater monitoring wells have
been installed and groundwater studies are ongoing. (EPA 2009; USFS 2009, 2010).
EPA maintains records of small- and large-quantity generators of hazardous waste pursuant to the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act through a national program management and inventory system about hazardous
waste handlers. Small-quantity generators produce between 220 and 2,200 pounds of hazardous waste per month;
large-quantity generators produce more than 2,200 pounds of hazardous waste or more than 2.2 pounds of acutely
hazardous waste per month. This information is available to the public through EPA’s EnviroMapper database
(EPA 2012). Although no large-quantity generators are located near the study area, a number of small-quantity
generators are located in the immediate vicinity of the study area, the closest of which are listed below:
►
►

Pacific Bell (now AT&T), 2633 Sussex Avenue
Rite Aid Drugstore No. 6107, 1020 Al Tahoe Boulevard

Potential Sources of Hazardous Materials in the Study Area
The only portion of the study area in which hazardous materials are currently used and stored is the TKPOA
Corporation Yard. The TKPOA Corporation Yard is approximately 3.3 acres and is used primarily to store
maintenance equipment, including several outboard motor boats, pickup trucks, and occasionally a backhoe.
Hazardous materials are stored in on-site storage containers or within one of two storage sheds. The corporation
yard is also used as a transfer point for milfoil weeds harvested from the Tahoe Keys Marina and its waterways.
Hazardous materials stored on-site are limited to common hazardous substances, including fuel, lubricants such as
oil, and solvents such as paint (Kleinfelder 2009).

Human Health/Risk of Upset

The TKPOA Corporation Yard formerly operated fueling activities at the site and properly abandoned a 2,000gallon UST in place by filling it with concrete (EDCDEM 2010). Soil contaminated with petroleum, which was
located near the maintenance shop, was excavated in 2002 and 2003. The results of a Phase II Environmental Site
Assessment performed in October 2009 indicated that previous excavation activities had not removed all the
contaminated soil, and one of the groundwater samples for Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons in the gasoline range
exceeded the allowable maximum contaminant level (Kleinfelder 2009). Therefore, upon completion of the Phase
II Environmental Site Assessment, 91.62 tons of soil contaminated with petroleum was excavated from the
maintenance shop and UST locations. Two monitoring wells were installed in 2010 and groundwater sampling
results over two quarters indicated that groundwater was not affected in the areas where soil was excavated. A
public notice stating the site did not pose a threat to human health or the environment was released by El Dorado
County on October 22, 2010 (EDCDEM 2010).
Schools within One-Quarter Mile of the Study Area
Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines recommends that an EIR consider whether a project might emit or
handle hazardous materials within one-quarter mile of an existing or proposed school. Four schools exist within
one-quarter mile of the study area:
►
►
►
►

Jubilee Preschool, approximately 0.24 mile from the study area
Saint Theresa Catholic School (kindergarten through 8th grade), approximately 0.2 mile from the study area
South Tahoe Middle School, approximately 0.2 mile from the study area
Blue Ridge School, approximately 0.18 mile from the study area

Wildlife Hazards to Aviation
The Lake Tahoe Airport is located approximately 1 mile southwest of the nearest edge of the study area. The
airport is equipped to be a commercial air carrier/general-aviation airport owned and operated by the CSLT,
although it does not currently support commercial flights and there is no commercial operator at the airport. The
airport includes one north-south asphalt runaway, which is 8,544 feet long by 150 feet wide (CSLT 2007).
The Lake Tahoe Airport is adjacent to the Upper Truckee River and its corridor of aquatic, wetland, riparian, and
upland habitats that extends from upstream of the airport through South Lake Tahoe to the lake. The airport’s
location in this corridor, its proximity to Lake Tahoe, and the extensive areas of natural vegetation nearby create
the potential for hazardous wildlife movement through the airport’s clear, approach/departure, and overflight
zones.
The study area provides habitat for several groups of species that can be hazardous to aviation (FAA 2007):
►

Waterfowl. This group includes all ducks, geese, and swans. Although not strictly waterfowl, rails and grebes
are also included in this guild. Most of the study area, including the river corridor, Sailing Lagoon and other
open water, and wet and montane meadows, provides habitat for waterfowl.

►

Gulls. The beach and dune, Sailing Lagoon and other open water, disturbed areas, and to a lesser extent, most
other land cover types provide habitat for gulls.

►

Sparrows, Larks, and Finches. Species in this group forage throughout most of the study area, and also breed
in most land cover types.

►

Raptors. Several species of raptors use the study area. The open cover types (e.g., montane and wet meadows)
provide foraging habitat, and the lodgepole pine and Jeffrey pine forests provide perch sites and some nesting
habitat for raptors.

California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

►

Swallows. Swallows are summer migrants, present from spring to early fall. The river and creek corridors,
Sailing Lagoon and other open water, beach and dune, wetlands, and the wet and montane meadows all
provide foraging habitat for swallows. Postbreeding flocks of swallows can be present in late summer,
particularly when flying insects are abundant.

►

Blackbirds and starlings. The disturbed areas, and to a lesser extent the beach, dune, and meadows in the
study area provide foraging habitat for blackbirds and starlings. All species in this guild are gregarious and
can form large flocks.

►

Corvids. This guild includes ravens, magpies, and jays. Most of the study area provides habitat for these
species.

►

Columbids. Only two species in this guild occur at the study area: rock pigeon and mourning dove. In the
study area, disturbed areas, the beach and dune, and to a lesser extent the montane meadows, provide habitats
for columbids.

►

Wading birds. This guild includes herons and egrets. The Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek, the margins
of the Sailing Lagoon and of other open water, and wetlands in the study area provide habitat for wading
birds.

Section 3.4, “Biological Resources: Vegetation and Wildlife,” provides additional information on the use by
hazardous wildlife of land cover within the study area. Habitat for these species groups is provided not only in the
study area, but also outside of the study area in a large portion of the clear, approach/departure, and overflight
zones, and in most of the 10,000-foot-wide Critical Zone (within which the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) recommends minimizing attractants of hazardous wildlife).
Despite the presence of extensive habitat for hazardous wildlife in its vicinity, bird-plane collisions (i.e., bird
strikes) have not been a problem at the Lake Tahoe Airport. There are no records of bird strikes at the Lake Tahoe
Airport in the FAA Wildlife Strike Database (FAA 2012) or within the memory of airport staff (Camp Dresser
and McKee [CDM] 2007).
Wildland Fire Hazards
Fire Hazards
Jeffrey pine and lodgepole pine forests cover portions of the study area adjacent to the Tahoe Island, Highland
Woods, and Al Tahoe subdivisions (see Exhibit 3.4-1). Conditions within these forests affect the level of fire
hazards in these adjacent neighborhoods.
Fires spread as a series of ignitions that occur when heat is transferred from burning fuel to adjacent fuels and
raise the temperature of that adjacent fuel, causing it to ignite. Heat is transferred by contact with flames, radiated
heat, and flying embers. These transfers of heat (and thus fire hazards) are affected by the arrangement (and
moisture content) of woody debris and plants.
The Conservancy implements treatments to reduce the fire hazards posed by forest vegetation in the study area.
Treatments include removing shrubs and trees to increase the spacing between tree crowns and the distance
between understory vegetation (i.e., herbaceous plants, shrubs, and smaller tree saplings) and the tree canopy, and
to reduce the total amount of vegetation and dead wood (USFS et al. 2007). Such treatments would reduce the
severity and rate of spread of a fire.

Human Health/Risk of Upset

Fuel Management
Forest vegetation on Conservancy property that poses fuel hazards is removed by the Conservancy. Since the
Conservancy acquired majority ownership of the study area in 2000, fuel reduction efforts have focused primarily
on removal of vegetation reported by citizens as dead or dying. Citizen requests for removal of vegetation in the
study area perceived to be a potential fuel hazard increased after the Angora fire (June 2007), prompting the
Conservancy to include the study area on the agency’s fuel hazard reduction list in Summer 2007. The
Conservancy flags vegetation within the study area and on nearby Conservancy-owned parcels, such as those
parcels scattered among the privately owned residential parcels in the Al Tahoe neighborhood. Once vegetation is
marked, the Conservancy is responsible for removal of fuels and periodic maintenance.
Mosquito Hazards
Mosquito Ecology
The life cycle of the mosquito consists of four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult (California Department of Public
Health [CDPH] 2008:5–8). The egg, larva, and pupa stages are completed in calm, standing water in permanent,
seasonal, or intermittent waters, including seasonal and permanent wetlands, and even in small isolated waters
such as drying pools of ephemeral drainages, tire ruts, and artificial containers. Larvae hatch from eggs in water
and feed on organic matter and microorganisms, such as bacteria. Fish and predatory insects feed on mosquito
larva, and greatly reduce their abundance in permanent bodies of water. The pupa stage lasts several days, during
which the larva changes into an adult. Seasonal and environmental conditions determine the length of time it takes
for larval mosquitoes to complete their development; some species develop faster than others under the same
conditions. Depending on average temperatures, it may take from four days to a month for the mosquito to mature
from egg to adult; with warmer temperatures, development accelerates.
Adults may remain close to where they hatched or may disperse from several hundred yards to several miles,
depending on the species (Walton 2003:2, CDPH 2008:Appendix D). Female mosquitoes require meals of blood
for protein, so that they can produce eggs (CDPH 2008:5). Hosts that can supply blood include reptiles,
amphibians, mammals (including humans), and birds. Most adult females live for about two weeks, though some
may survive longer, and those that emerge late in the season may hibernate through the winter to begin laying
eggs in the spring.
Common mosquitoes in the Tahoe Basin include species in the genus Aedes that breed in the standing water that
results from melting snow; species in the genus Culiseta that breed in ponds, basins, and human-made containers;
and Culex tarsalis, the “encephalitis mosquito” that can transmit to humans viruses that can cause encephalitis
(an inflammation of the brain) (EDCDEM 2012b). The immature stages of C. tarsalis can develop in almost any
standing freshwater (CDPH 2008).
All mosquito species are potential vectors of organisms that can cause disease to pets, domestic animals, wildlife,
or humans (El Dorado County 2008). Public concern regarding West Nile virus, a disease transmitted to humans
by mosquitoes (including C. tarsalis), has increased since the virus was first detected in the United States in 1999.
A mosquito first acquires West Nile virus by feeding on a bird with the virus in its blood. Most people and
animals that are infected with the virus have mild symptoms or none. In rare cases, the virus can cause
encephalitis. West Nile Virus has been detected in the vicinity of the study area.
Mosquito Control
The study area is within EDCVCD’s monitoring zone, and most of the study area is recognized as a breeding
ground for mosquitoes. EDCVCD technicians identify and monitor mosquito breeding sources at least every
2 weeks from March through September. In years of especially heavy precipitation, some portions of the study
area are especially prone to being inundated with standing water for long periods of time. Larvacides have been
applied to standing water bodies within the study area. Treatments contain either methoprene, which mimics an

insect growth hormone to prevent adult mosquito development, or the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis
israelensis, which produces toxins that target mosquito larvae and other insects. The type and quantity of
larvacide used is regulated by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES AND MITIGATION MEASURES

SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA
For this analysis, significance criteria are based on the checklist presented in Appendix G of the State CEQA
Guidelines; the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist; factual or scientific information and data; and regulatory
standards of Federal, State, and local agencies. These criteria also encompass the factors taken into account under
NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and intensity of its effects.
CEQA Criteria
Under CEQA, an alternative was determined to result in a significant impact related to hazards or hazardous
materials if it would:
►

create a significant hazard to the public or the environment through the routine transport, use, or disposal of
hazardous materials (CEQA 1);

►

create a significant hazard to the public or the environment through reasonably foreseeable upset and/or
accident conditions involving the release of hazardous materials into the environment (CEQA 2);

►

emit hazardous emissions or handle hazardous or acutely hazardous materials, substances, or waste within
one-quarter mile of an existing or proposed school (CEQA 3);

►

be located on a site that is included on a list of hazardous materials sites complied pursuant to Government
Code Section 65962.5 and, as a result, create a significant hazard to the public or the environment (CEQA 4);

►

be located within an airport land use plan, or within 2 miles of a public airport or public-use airport that
would result in a safety hazard for people residing or working in the project area (CEQA 5);

►

impair implementation of or physically interfere with an adopted emergency response plan or emergency
evacuation plan (CEQA 6); or

►

expose people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury, or death involving wildland fires, including where
wildlands are adjacent to urbanized areas or where residences are intermixed with wildlands (CEQA 7).

NEPA Criteria
An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the
environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the proposed action. Under NEPA, the significance
of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account
under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are
encompassed by the CEQA criteria used for this analysis.
TRPA Criteria
Based on TRPA’s Initial Environmental Checklist, an alternative was determined to have a significant impact
related to hazards and/or hazardous materials if it would:
►

involve a risk of explosion or the release of hazardous substances (TRPA 1);

►
►

create a health hazard or potential health hazard (TRPA 2); or
expose people to potential health hazards (TRPA 3).

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
This analysis considers the range and nature of foreseeable use, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials
resulting from the project alternatives and the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, and identifies the primary ways
that these hazardous materials could expose individuals or the environment to health and safety risks. As
discussed above, compliance with applicable federal, state, and local health and safety laws and regulations by
residents and businesses in the project vicinity would generally protect public health and safety. State and local
agencies would be expected to continue to enforce applicable requirements to the extent that they do now.
The following reports documenting potential hazardous conditions in the study area were reviewed for this
analysis:
►
►
►

applicable land use plans;
available literature, including documents published by federal, state, county, and city agencies; and
applicable elements from the El Dorado County General Plan.

The information obtained from these sources was reviewed and summarized to establish existing conditions and
to evaluate the significance of potential environmental impacts, based on the significance criteria presented above.
In determining the level of significance, this analysis assumes that construction and operation of any alternative
would comply with relevant federal, state, regional, and local ordinances and regulations.

EFFECTS NOT DISCUSSED FURTHER IN THIS EIR/EIS/EIS
Hazardous Materials Sites (CEQA 4)—There are no hazardous materials sites subject to compliance with
Government Code Section 65962.5 in the study area.
Emergency Plans (CEQA 6)—No alternatives would impair implementation of or physically interfere with an
adopted emergency response plan or evacuation plan.

(Alt. 1)

Potential Hazards to the Public from Use of Hazardous Materials. (CEQA 1, 2; TRPA 1, 2, 3) Alternative 1
would involve the storage, use, and transport of hazardous materials in the study area during construction
activities. However, as described in Environmental Commitments 5 and 6, the Conservancy would develop
construction site management plans and comply with Federal, State, and local regulations related to
hazardous materials to avoid or minimize potential impacts on health and safety during project construction.
Thus, significant hazards to the public would not be created during construction through routine transport,
storage, use, disposal, and risk of upset. This impact would be less than significant.

Alternative 1 would involve the storage, use, and transport of hazardous materials (e.g., fuels, oils, lubricants)
during construction activities. However, to avoid or minimize potential impacts on health and safety during
project construction, the Conservancy would implement Environmental Commitment (EC) 5, “Prepare and
Implement Effective Construction Site Management Plans to Minimize Risks of Water Quality Degradation and

22 of the California Code of Regulations. The Conservancy, contractors, and others would be required to use,
store, and transport hazardous materials in compliance with federal, state, and local regulations during project
construction and operation. Activities that would use hazardous materials on-site after the project is constructed
would be required to obtain permits and comply with appropriate regulatory agency standards and permit
requirements designed to avoid releases of hazardous waste. No hazardous materials are expected to be needed
after project completion. Because the project would implement and comply with existing hazardous-materials
regulations (e.g., regulations administered by Cal OSHA, DTSC) and permit requirements, impacts related to
creation of significant hazards to the public through routine transport, use, disposal, and risk of upset would not
occur with project development. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.7-2
(Alt. 1)

Potential Hazards to Human Health from Exposure to Existing On-Site Hazardous Materials. (CEQA 2;
TRPA 1, 2, 3) Alternative 1 could expose construction workers to hazardous materials present on-site during
construction activities at the TKPOA Corporation Yard and hazardous materials on-site could create an
environmental or health hazard if left in place. As described in Environmental Commitment 9, the Conservancy
would develop and implement a construction management program; however, this impact would be potentially
significant.

The only portion of the study area in which hazardous materials are currently used and stored is the TKPOA
Corporation Yard. Hazardous materials are stored in on-site storage containers or within one of two storage sheds.
Hazardous materials stored on-site are confined to common hazardous substances, including fuel, lubricants such
as oil, and solvents such as paint. In the past, although applicable regulations may have been followed, spills of
hazardous materials may have occurred and contaminated soil at the TKPOA Corporation Yard. Furthermore,
TKPOA Corporation Yard formerly operated fueling activities at the site and properly abandoned a 2,000-gallon
UST in place by filling it with concrete. Soil contaminated with petroleum near the maintenance shop was
excavated in 2002 and 2003. As part of a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment performed in 2009, 91.62 tons
of soil contaminated with petroleum were excavated from the maintenance shop and UST locations. Two
monitoring wells were installed in 2010 and groundwater sampling results over two quarters indicated that
groundwater was not affected in the areas of soil excavation. A public notice stating the site did not pose a threat
to human health or the environment was released by El Dorado County on October 22, 2010 (El Dorado County
2010).
Movement of stored hazardous materials and fill materials from the TKPOA Corporation Yard would occur
during construction of restoration features; consequently, construction workers might be exposed to existing onsite hazardous materials at the corporation yard. To avoid or minimize potential impacts on health and safety
during project construction, the Conservancy would implement EC 9, “Develop and Implement a Construction
Management Program,” described in Table 2-6 in Chapter 2; however, implementing EC 9 would not be
sufficient to avoid all potential hazards to human health from exposure to on-site hazardous materials. Therefore,
this impact would be potentially significant.
Mitigation Measure 3.7-2a (Alt. 1): Prepare and Implement a Health and Safety Plan and Provide Qualified Oversight of
Fill Removal Related to Excavation Activities at the Corporation Yard.
►

The Conservancy and their contractor(s) will develop and implement a health and safety plan (HASP) that
clearly notifies all workers of the potential to encounter hazardous materials during demolition and
construction activities. The HASP will identify proper handling and disposal procedures for contaminants
expected to be on-site as well as maps and phone numbers for local hospitals and other emergency contacts.
All protocols outlined in the HASP will be complied with throughout project implementation.

►

Any stored hazardous materials present in the study area will be removed and disposed at appropriately
permitted locations prior to construction. A qualified professional (e.g., geologist or engineer) will oversee fill
excavation activities and abandoned UST tank removal at the Corporation Yard in order to properly identify
any potentially contaminated soils. that may be present. Excavation of the UST must comply with El Dorado

County UST Ordinance No. 4332. If contaminated soils are found, implement Mitigation Measure 3.7-2b
(Alt 1).
►

UST tank removal will include measures that ensure the safe transport, and disposal methods. Remediation
actions, if necessary, will be defined, in consultation with the EDCDEM, DTSC, and Lahontan Regional
Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB), and implemented during construction.

Mitigation Measure 3.7-2b (Alt. 1): Notify Appropriate Federal, State, and Local Agencies if Contaminated Soils Are
Identified, and Complete Recommended Remediation Activities.
To reduce health hazards associated with potential exposure to hazardous substances, the Conservancy would
implement the following measures if necessary:
►

The Conservancy and its contractor(s) will notify the appropriate federal, state, and local agencies if evidence
of previously undiscovered soil or groundwater contamination (e.g., stained soil, odorous groundwater) is
encountered during construction activities. Any contaminated areas will be cleaned up in accordance with
recommendations made by the EDCDEM, the Lahontan RWQCB, DTSC, or other appropriate federal, state,
or local regulatory agencies, as generally described above.

►

The Conservancy will prepare a site plan for remediation activities appropriate for proposed land uses,
including excavation and removal of on-site contaminated soils, and needed redistribution of clean fill
material on the study area. The plan will include measures that ensure the safe transport, use, and disposal of
contaminated soil and building debris removed from the site. If contaminated groundwater is encountered
during site excavation activities, the construction contractor will report the contamination to the appropriate
regulatory agencies, dewater the excavated area, and treat the contaminated groundwater to remove
contaminants before discharge into the sanitary sewer system. The construction contractor will be required to
comply with the plan and applicable federal, state, and local laws. The plan will outline measures for specific
handling and reporting procedures for hazardous materials, and disposal of hazardous materials removed from
the site at an appropriate off-site disposal facility.

Significance after Mitigation: Because the removal and remediation of any contaminated soil that may be
encountered and the removal of the UST at the TKPOA Corporation Yard would be overseen by the appropriate
entities, the potential for exposure to hazardous materials would be substantially reduced. Therefore, with
implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.7-2a (Alt. 1) and 3.7-2 (Alt. 1) as described above, Impact 3.7-2 (Alt. 1)
would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.7-3
(Alt. 1)

Potential Hazardous Emissions or Handling of Hazardous or Acutely Hazardous Materials, Substances,
or Waste within One-Quarter Mile of an Existing or Proposed School. (CEQA 3; TRPA 1, 2, 3) Under
Alternative 1, some construction activities that involve the handling of hazardous or acutely hazardous
materials could occur within one-quarter mile of a school. Also, hazardous materials present on-site may be
exposed during construction activities within one-quarter mile of a school. However, as described in
Environmental Commitment 9, the school district would be notified about proper handling of hazardous
materials related to the project before the EIR/EIS/EIS is certified. This impact would be less than significant.

Four schools are located within one-quarter mile of the study area, and under Alternative 1 some construction
activities involving the handling of hazardous or acutely hazardous materials could occur within one-quarter mile
of these schools. However, during construction activities, the use of hazardous materials would occur in
compliance with federal, state, and local regulations. As described in Impact 3.7-1 (Alt. 1), impacts related to
creation of hazards through routine transport, storage, use, disposal, and risk of upset would be less than
significant. However, as described in Impact 3.7-2 (Alt. 1), hazardous materials could already be present on-site,
and if present, may be exposed during construction activities. As described in EC 9 (Table 2-6), the Conservancy
and its contractors shall provide written notification of the project to the Lake Tahoe Unified School District, as

required by PRC Section 21151.4, at least 30 days before certification of the EIR/EIS/EIS and shall consult with
the school district regarding proper handling and disposal methods associated with substances subject to
California Health and Safety Code Section 25532. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.7-4
(Alt. 1)

Potential Increase in Public Health Hazards from Mosquitoes Resulting from Increased Floodplain
Inundation. (TRPA 3) Alternative 1 would result in more extensive floodplain inundation that could result in
greater abundance of mosquitoes; however, as described in Environmental Commitment 10, the Conservancy
would continue to coordinate with and support EDCVCD efforts to manage mosquito populations, and thus, not
increase the potential for exposure of people to mosquito-borne viruses. This impact would be less than
significant.

Much of the study area is recognized by EDCVCD as a breeding ground for mosquitoes, and thus, the district
monitors the abundance of mosquito larva and implements treatments to control mosquitoes, as necessary.
Although the study area already provides existing breeding habitat for mosquitoes, in some years Alternative 1
would increase the extent of floodplain inundation (e.g., the two-year streamflow event would inundate
approximately an additional 12 acres [Conservancy 2006:A1]). This additional inundation would increase the
extent and duration of calm, standing water in dense vegetation, and therefore, could enhance breeding habitat for
mosquitoes. As a result, Alternative 1 could increase mosquito abundance. However, as described in EC 10,
“Establish and Implement a Management Agreement with the El Dorado County Vector Control District,”
described in Table 2-6 in Chapter 2, the Conservancy would continue to coordinate with and support EDCVCD
efforts to control mosquito populations in the study area. The Conservancy would coordinate management
activities with EDCVCD and implement measures as necessary to ensure necessary access for monitoring and
control. Therefore, the potential for exposure of people to mosquito-borne viruses would remain comparable to
existing conditions in the study area. This impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.7-5
(Alt. 1)

Potential for Airspace Safety Hazards Associated with Restoration and Enhancement of Habitat for
Hazardous Wildlife. (CEQA 5) Alternative 1 would restore or enhance some habitat for hazardous wildlife in
and near the approach/departure zone of the Lake Tahoe Airport. However, extensive habitat attracting
hazardous wildlife already exists in the study area, and thus, Alternative 1 is not anticipated to substantially
increase the attraction of hazardous wildlife. Also, the CLUP identifies management of timber, fish, and wildlife
habitat, as well as SEZ restoration, as compatible land uses for the approach/departure zone. Furthermore,
bird-aircraft collisions have not been occurring at the Lake Tahoe Airport, notwithstanding the presence of
habitat for hazardous wildlife along the Upper Truckee River at the airport. Therefore, this impact would be
less than significant.

Existing habitats in the study area are an attractant to wildlife that could potentially pose a hazard to aircraft.
Alternative 1 would enhance or restore some habitat for birds that are categorized as hazardous wildlife in terms
of the potential for aircraft collisions. In particular, this alternative would increase the extent of floodplain
inundation and would modify existing waterways to create lagoon habitat.
This restored habitat would be located at a distance of approximately one mile or more from the airport. The
increased floodplain inundation and lagoon restoration would be outside of the approach/departure zone of the
Lake Tahoe Airport, but within the 10,000-foot-wide zone where FAA recommends that wildlife attractants be
minimized. Bird-attracting habitats are already present in these locations, and enhancement and restoration
activities are not anticipated to cause a substantial increase in the attraction of hazardous wildlife.
SEZ restoration, timber management, range management, and management of fish and wildlife habitat are
identified in the CLUP as compatible land uses for the clear, approach/departure, and overflight zones of the Lake
Tahoe Airport (CSLT 2007:38). Thus, a wide range of management, enhancement, and restoration activities in
nearby natural vegetation is considered compatible with the airport’s operations.

Furthermore, bird strikes have not historically affected aviation safety at the Lake Tahoe Airport. There are no
records of bird-related air strikes in the FAA Wildlife Strike Database (FAA 2012) or within the memory of
airport staff (CDM 2007). With or without project implementation, the likelihood of wildlife-aircraft accidents
associated with the Lake Tahoe Airport is considered low. Recognizing that bird-aircraft collisions have not been
occurring at the Lake Tahoe Airport despite the presence of extensive, immediately surrounding forest, riparian,
and meadow habitat, the enhancement of habitat a mile or more from the airport would not substantially change
aircraft safety conditions. Because an increase in wildlife-related hazards under Alternative 1 is not expected and
the proposed land uses in under Alternative 1 are compatible with the CLUP, this impact would be less than
significant.
IMPACT
3.7-6
(Alt. 1)

Potential for Wildland Fire Caused by Construction Equipment. During the dry summer season, sparks
from on-site construction equipment could result in wildland fire. However, as described in Environmental
Commitment 9, the Conservancy would develop and implement a fire prevention and management plan to
minimize the risk of accidental ignition of wildland fires. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

During summer, the project site consists of dry annual and perennial grasses and low-growing shrubs. Therefore,
the project components would be constructed in an area where the combination of physical and weather factors
may lead to a high wildfire hazard. Operation of construction equipment could result in accidental ignition of
wildland fires that may pose a significant risk of loss, injury, or death. However, as described in EC 9 (Table 2-6),
the Conservancy would develop and implement a fire prevention and management plan to minimize the risk of
accidental ignition of wildland fires. This impact would be less than significant.

activities. However, as described in Environmental Commitments 5 and 6, the Conservancy would develop
construction site management plans and comply with federal, state, and local regulations related to hazardous

This impact is similar to Impact 3.7-4 (Alt. 1), but would increase floodplain inundation acreage more than
Alternative 1. (For example, the two-year streamflow event under Alternative 2 would inundate an additional 63
acres, compared with an additional 12 acres under Alternative 1 [Conservancy 2006:A1].) Nonetheless, for the

As the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, Alternative 5 would not involve the storage, use, or transport of
hazardous materials in the study area during construction activities. Thus, Alternative 5 would not create hazards
to the public through routine transport, storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials. No impact would occur.

hazard. No impact would occur.

Because the project would not be constructed under Alternative 5, this alternative would not involve any
construction activities that could expose hazardous materials that could be present on-site. Thus, Alternative 5
would not expose construction workers to hazardous materials and would not create a health hazard by exposing

5 would not expose hazardous waste or involve the handling of hazardous materials, substances, or waste
within one-quarter mile of a school. No impact would occur.

Because no construction would occur under Alternative 5, this alternative would not include construction
activities that involve excavation that could expose hazardous waste potentially existing on-site. It also would not

HYDROLOGY AND FLOODING

This section summarizes existing hydrologic conditions in the study area, presents the regulatory guidance for
hydrologic resources, and evaluates potential adverse environmental effects of project implementation on
hydrology.
The examination of hydrology is based primarily on (1) previous hydrologic and hydraulic analyses prepared for
the project, including Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project: Processes and Functions of the
Upper Truckee Marsh (Conservancy and DGS 2003) and Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project
Alternatives Evaluation Report (Conservancy and DGS 2005); and (2) the preliminary engineering schematic
conceptual design prepared for the alternatives. Additional important information is referenced from other
relevant published and unpublished academic studies and reports and other documents issued by federal, state,
and local agencies. For a discussion of geomorphology and water quality issues, please refer to Section 3.9,
“Geomorphology and Water Quality.” Cumulative hydrology and flooding impacts are addressed in Section 3.18,
“Cumulative Impacts.” Consistency with TRPA goals and policies is presented in Section 3.10, “Land Use.”

Goals and Policies
The Goals and Policies document of the 1987 Regional Plan presents the overall approach to meeting the
environmental thresholds. A key component is the Land Use Element, which identifies fundamental philosophies
directing land use and development in the Tahoe Basin. It addresses topics such as suitable development locations
and maintenance of the region’s environmental, social, physical, and economic well-being.
Code of Ordinances
Proposed project construction activities are regulated by Section 60.4, “Best Management Practice
Requirements,” of the TRPA Code of Ordinances (TRPA Code), specifically in relation to best management

practices (BMPs), especially temporary, permanent, and standard BMPs. In accordance with the Handbook of
Best Management Practices, and as required in Section 33.5, “Grading and Construction Schedules,” of the TRPA
Code, temporary BMPs shall be implemented on construction sites and maintained throughout the construction
period (TRPA 2003:25-1). Permanent BMPs must be applied within the parcel or all project area boundaries,
unless the project is exempt. TRPA states that a project that involves Stream Environment Zone (SEZ) restoration
may be exempt from the aforementioned requirements. SEZ is defined by TRPA as the major and minor streams,
intermittent streams, drainage ways, meadows and marshes, primary and secondary riparian vegetation, and other
water influence zones areas within the Lake Tahoe Region that provide natural treatment and conveyance of
surface runoff (TRPA 2004:28).
Standard BMP requirements that are applicable to the project deal mainly with drainage conveyance. Drainage
conveyances through a parcel shall be designed for at least a 10-year, 24-hour storm. Drainage conveyances
through an SEZ shall be designed for a 50-year storm, at a minimum.
Chapter 35, “Natural Hazard Standards,” of the TRPA Code also addresses floodplain management. TRPA
defines a floodplain as that portion of a river valley, adjacent to the channel, that is built of sediments deposited
during the present geological/climatic regime. Hydrologic statistics are used to estimate the magnitude of peak
streamflow expected on a 100-year recurrence interval, and the area that could be inundated from that event is
defined as the 100-year floodplain. TRPA reviews all additional development in 100-year floodplains and
regulates any necessary public uses located in the floodplains. The 100-year floodplain is determined by the limits
delineated by the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA). TRPA prohibits development, grading, and filling of lands within the 100-year floodplain, with certain
exceptions, including specific public outdoor recreation facilities and water quality control facilities. TRPA may
permit erosion control, habitat restoration, wetland rehabilitation, SEZ restoration, and similar projects within a
100-year floodplain. To receive a permit from TRPA, the proponent of a restoration project within the floodplain
must show that the project is necessary for environmental protection, must demonstrate that there is no reasonable
alternative to reduce the extent of encroachment, and must fully mitigate all impacts (TRPA 1980:28-3).
TRPA’s development restrictions and exemption findings for 100-year floodplains do not apply to the shorezone
of Lake Tahoe, except where the study area is determined to be within the 100-year floodplain of a tributary
stream, which is where this study area lies. Therefore, the restrictions and exemptions for shorezone protection in
Chapter 81, “Permissible Uses and Accessory Structures in the Shorezone and Lakezone,” of the TRPA Code
apply in addition to those for floodplain protection mentioned above. (See Section 3.9, “Geomorphology and
Water Quality,” for further discussion.)
Plan Area Statements
TRPA’s plan area statements (PASs) outline land use classifications, special policies, planning considerations,
permissible uses, and maximum allowances for the Tahoe Basin. The PASs in which the study area is located are
PAS 099 (Al Tahoe), PAS 100 (Truckee Marsh), PAS 102 (Tahoe Keys), PAS 103 (Sierra Tract Commercial),
PAS 104 (Highland Woods), and PAS 111 (Tahoe Island). The criteria and permissible uses for each PAS
covering the study area are described in Section 3.10, “Land Use,” of this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS. Considerations
include commercial and residential uses that infringe on the SEZ and restrictive highway crossings over the Upper
Truckee River and Trout Creek that alter the natural functioning capacity of the SEZ. The relevant special policies
outlined in this PAS are:
(1)

Stream zones should be restored where U.S. Highway 50 (U.S. 50) crosses the Upper Truckee River and
Trout Creek.

(2)

SEZs should be restored in the vicinity of the crossings of Trout Creek at U.S. 50 and at Black Bart Road.

(3)

New roadway alignments through SEZs are to be discouraged.

El Dorado County
Land under the jurisdiction of El Dorado County is located upstream of the portion of the Upper Truckee River
located within the study area, so the El Dorado County Code’s provisions on grading (Chapter 15.14) do not
directly apply to the project. However, the project’s compliance with TRPA and City of South Lake Tahoe
(CSLT) grading requirements and water quality and flooding obligations required by the Clean Water Act will
also provide consistency with El Dorado County requirements.
City of South Lake Tahoe
The study area is located entirely within CSLT’s jurisdictional limits. Chapter 8, “Building Regulations,” of the
CSLT Ordinance requires that projects prepare a grading plan for review and grading-permit approval by the
CSLT building official. The grading plan must include the present contours of the land and the proposed final
grade and location of improvements. The purpose of the review is for CSLT to safeguard adjoining properties and
public streets and ways from damage by unnatural flows of surface waters, and to prevent construction of homes
and other buildings in areas likely to become flooded. CSLT is the floodplain administrator for FEMA in the
project area, responsible for implementing the federal policies and regulations for floodplain management.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Hydrology
The study area’s hydrology is the result of numerous physical environmental parameters. Among the important
parameters are watershed characteristics and climatic conditions affecting the Upper Truckee River and Trout
Creek, streamflow magnitudes and regimes, runoff from adjoining urban drainage areas, direct precipitation in the
study area, Lake Tahoe surface-water elevations, and groundwater elevations and gradients.
Surface Water
Watersheds
The study area is situated at the downstream end of the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek watersheds
(Exhibit 3.8-1), the two largest watersheds that drain to Lake Tahoe. The watershed areas of the river and creek
are 56.5 and 41.2 square miles, respectively; these areas comprise 18 percent and 13 percent of the total area
tributary to Lake Tahoe (Rowe and Allander 2000:7–8). The general characteristics of these two watershed areas
provide a background for understanding specific hydrologic events and patterns observed in the study area.
The watersheds of the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek share several important characteristics related to
surface-water and groundwater hydrology. The geology of both basins is dominated by granitic rock with glacial
deposits and lacustrine sediment, and by similar distributions of soil types and land cover (Jeton 1999). In
addition, they both encompass the largest urban centers in the Tahoe Basin. The land uses, transportation systems,
and water use (e.g., groundwater pumping, urban stormwater) of these urban centers substantially affect the
amount and patterns of runoff relative to undisturbed watersheds (Jeton 1999).
The differences in shape, orientation, and proportion of watershed land near lake level affect the runoff patterns of
the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek basins. The Upper Truckee River basin is elongated from north to
south, characterized by a total valley distance of about 21 miles from the southern headwaters to Lake Tahoe. The
highest headwater areas in the basin generally face north and west. The elevation of the Upper Truckee River
watershed ranges from about 6,225 feet at the lake to about 10,000 feet at the crest. About 20 percent of the area
within the Upper Truckee River watershed is below 6,500 feet (generally associated with a broad U-shaped
valley). The Trout Creek basin is fan-shaped, with a total valley distance of about 15 miles from the headwaters to
Lake Tahoe. Its broad headwater area faces northwest. The elevation of the Trout Creek watershed ranges from
about 6,225 feet at the lake to about 10,800 feet; only about 10 percent of the Trout Creek watershed lies below

Hydrology and Flooding

6,500 feet (USACE 2002:Exhibits 2-5 and 2-6). Differences in basin shape, headwater orientation, and elevation
distributions produce variations in storm patterns, snowpack accumulations, snowmelt processes, and the time
required for runoff to pass through the basin to the lake (Conservancy and DGS 2003:2-3).
Streams
Annual and seasonal flows in both the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek vary substantially, as is typical of
unregulated snowmelt rivers in the Sierra Nevada. The difference in flow volumes and peak magnitudes generally
reflects differences in basin size (Conservancy and DGS 2003: 2-6 to 2-11), with some variations as a result of
snow accumulation, snowmelt patterns, and differences in base flow.
Most precipitation in the Tahoe Basin falls between October and May, in the form of snow at higher elevations
and snow and rain at lake level (Roberts and Reuter 2007:3-6 through 3-7). The seasonal snowmelt process
creates annual streamflow peaks in May or June. The snowpack at lower elevations can melt completely and
generate runoff in the urban areas and valley floors near the lake before the snow at the headwaters melts. The
minimum streamflows on both streams occur during the summer and fall.
Climate-driven cycles can produce extreme highs and lows during a single year and from one year to the next.
Precipitation timing and amounts and the mix of snow and rain can vary substantially from year to year (Coats
and Goldman 2001:406, Rowe et al. 2002:13), producing year-to-year variability in streamflow. Future climate
change may alter the spatial distribution and total amount of precipitation as well as the relative proportion of
snow versus rain, and alter flood and drought extremes.
Streamflow observations made at several locations in the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek watersheds
characterize the hydrology of streamflows entering the study area from both watersheds (Table 3.8-1 and
Exhibit 3.8-1).

The mean daily streamflows on the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek for water years 1972–2007 were
analyzed to provide comparable years for both streams. The monthly statistics demonstrate generally similar
seasonal patterns on both streams, but different magnitudes, particularly for the median and higher flows
(Exhibits 3.8-2 and 3.8-3). Median flows during snowmelt season are around 200 cubic feet per second (cfs) on
the Upper Truckee River, but only 50 cfs on Trout Creek. The maximum flows on the Upper Truckee River are
much larger than those on Trout Creek, as might be expected based on drainage area (Conservancy and DGS
2003:2-12). However, Trout Creek has similar or slightly higher fall base flows. A later snowmelt peak, higher
headwater elevations, and a larger percentage of drainage area above 8,000 feet in the Trout Creek watershed may
increase the supply for base flow (Conservancy and DGS 2003:2-12). Summer/fall evaporative losses may also be
reduced in the shorter, steeper, narrower valleys and channels along Trout Creek.
Local Runoff
The study area’s surface-water hydrology also includes direct on-site precipitation, snowpack and snowmelt
processes, and runoff from adjacent urbanized lands that drain to the meadow, streams, or both (Exhibit 3.8-4).
The adjacent urban drainage areas are Al Tahoe, Highland Woods, County Cross Roads Village, Tahoe Island,
and Sky Meadows. Although these local runoff sources are small compared to the upstream watersheds, the water
they produce supplements that represented by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gauge records. In some
locations (e.g., Al Tahoe neighborhood), the urban storm drainage system may convey water from a larger-than­
natural topographic watershed. In other locations (e.g., Tahoe Island neighborhood), the urban storm drainage
system may reroute water to new discharge points, resulting in a smaller-than-natural local watershed. Much of
the urban drainage from these areas is gravity fed via CSLT’s system of curbs and gutters and is directed into the
study area via simple outfalls, or in some cases, via flow across road surfaces. Drainage through Sky Meadows is
in a vegetated swale/ditch.
The hydrology of these small urbanized watersheds has not been measured, but it can be estimated for the purpose
of sizing storm drainage features, water quality treatment improvements, or both. Hydrographs showing the levels
of discharge from these drainage areas would likely reflect the urban land uses and low elevation, and thus would
rise to peak sooner than the hydrographs for the overall watershed. Although they are relatively small, these areas
could have larger peaks and volumes than they did in their historic, undeveloped state, except where drainage and
water quality mitigation measures have been fully implemented.
At the request of the Lake Tahoe Storm Water Quality Improvement Committee, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) is developing a new drainage design criteria manual to improve estimates of runoff volumes,
peak discharges, and hydrograph shapes (USACE 2007). The methodology approved by CSLT or the committee
(or both) at the time of project review would be applied to quantify runoff as a basis for the project’s
modifications to storm drainage features, mitigation measures, or both. Tentative estimates of urban drainage
hydrology are provided below in Section 3.8.2, “Environmental Consequences,” to compare alternatives, using
recommendations by USACE (2007).
Lake Tahoe
Lake Tahoe interacts with both the surface-water and groundwater hydrology of the study area. The lake directly
connects with the Upper Truckee River at the river’s mouth, and water flows across Barton Beach during flood
events. Direct surface-water and groundwater connections also exist at the Tahoe Keys Marina and the Sailing
Lagoon at a wide range of lake levels.
The natural rim of Lake Tahoe’s outlet to the Truckee River at Tahoe City is 6,221.9 feet National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD), or 6,223.0 feet on the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation’s (Reclamation’s) lake datum
(Reclamation et al. 2008:3-41). Although some uncertainty exists about the elevation of the natural rim before
dam construction began in 1870, the working assumption is that 6,221.9 feet NGVD represents the natural rim.

Before the outlet was altered, this would have been the maximum lake level for hundreds to thousands of years.
However, the maximum level of the lake has been even higher than 6,221.9 feet NGVD on major geologic time
scales (i.e., 10,000 to more than 100,000 years ago) because volcanic flow or glacial ice dams, or both,
impounded the lake at its outlet. See Section 3.6, “Geology and Soils, Mineral Resources, and Land Capability
and Coverage,” for more information. The lake would have begun spilling whenever lake water levels exceeded
this elevation.
Dam construction and modification in the last 130 years raised the outlet’s elevation, and thus the maximum
possible lake level. The modern dam was constructed in 1913 and was seismically retrofitted and enlarged in
1988 (Roberts and Reuter 2007:3-2). The dam controls the top 6.1 feet of storage at Lake Tahoe as a federal
reservoir (Reclamation et al. 2008:3-3). Since issuance of the 1944 Orr Ditch Decree, dam operations have
provided for downstream water supply, but also have limited the maximum lake level to 6,228.0 feet NGVD
(6,229.1 feet Reclamation lake datum). Lake Tahoe can temporarily rise above the legal limit under extreme
precipitation and runoff conditions, such as the rapid surcharge of 0.3 foot that occurred on January 4, 1997, in
response to regional flooding. The outlet dam does not control minimum lake elevations, which fall below the
natural rim in response to drier climatic conditions.
The elevation of Lake Tahoe has gone through cycles of relatively high and low stands (several years above or
below median) for periods of several years (Exhibits 3.8-5 and 3.8-6). Relatively high stands occurred from 1900
to 1920, in the early 1940s, in the 1950s, from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s, in the early 1980s, and in the late
1990s. Occasional short-duration (one- to two-year) low-lake stands occurred in the late 1940s, in the early 1960s,
and in the late 1970s. Prominent low stands (several years below 6,223.0 feet NGVD) occurred from the mid­
1920s to the late 1930s and from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. The recent drought did not last for as many
years, but reached similar minimum elevations. Conditions since 2002 include a few years of low lake levels,
followed by a high year in 2006. The trend for the next couple of years is not predictable based solely on the
historic pattern.
In addition to the general year-to-year pattern, seasonal changes in Lake Tahoe’s elevation are noticeable in the
long-term monthly record. The seasonal changes in a given year are usually on the order of one–two feet, but
sometimes Lake Tahoe falls or rises several feet within a few months (Exhibits 3.8-5 and 3.8-6).
Statistical analysis of the daily lake levels for water years 1972–2007 (the same period analyzed for stream
records) describes the monthly pattern under modern watershed conditions and dam operations (Exhibit 3.8-7).
The typical lake levels (minimum through 20 percent exceedance) are highest in spring and early summer (May–
July) as a result of seasonal snowmelt runoff entering Lake Tahoe (Exhibit 3.8-7). However, maximum lake levels
have occurred in January from major rain-on-snow floods, despite lower median and minimum values in the fall
and winter months. The level of Lake Tahoe declines during the summer months as runoff input decreases and
evaporative loss increases. The lowest lake levels are in October and November.
Marina/Sailing Lagoon
The Tahoe Keys Marina is an artificial surface-water body located immediately west of the study area. Owned by
the Tahoe Keys Property Owners Association, the marina is generally parallel to the lower 3,000 feet of the Upper
Truckee River. The Tahoe Keys Marina has been directly connected to Lake Tahoe since its construction in the
late 1950s. In 1959, a navigation channel was dredged up to the mouth of the Upper Truckee River and one of its
natural distributary arms, known today as the “Sailing Lagoon.” (See the historic aerial maps in Appendix A of
Conservancy and DGS 2003.) From 1959 to 1969, the marina was connected to Lake Tahoe via the river and the
Sailing Lagoon served as a portion of the dredged navigation channel. In 1969, however, the marina’s navigation
channel was changed. The East Channel was excavated through Cove East Beach at its present location,
connecting the marina to the lake directly. Fill was placed across the Upper Truckee River’s former distributary
arm to cut off the Sailing Lagoon from the river. Since 1969, the Sailing Lagoon and Tahoe Keys Marina have
been connected to Lake Tahoe via the marina’s East Channel.

The marina and East Channel are dredged to about 6,216.2 feet NGVD every few years—most recently in 2004
(TKPOA 2005)—to maintain navigation depths (Conservancy and DGS 2003:3-9, 3-10). The Sailing Lagoon has
not been officially maintained as a primary navigation component since the State of California acquired it as part
of the Cove East Parcel in the early 1980s.
Surface-water levels in the Tahoe Keys Marina and Sailing Lagoon likely were equivalent to the lake elevations
described above (Exhibits 3.8-5, 3.8-6, and 3.8-7) for the period since 1959, once the open-water connections
were established or enlarged (or both) by dredging. Surface-water elevations in the Sailing Lagoon before the
1959 dredging of the river mouth and lagoon arm likely reflected combined controls from the river, high lake
levels, and groundwater. There are no direct records of these conditions, but it is likely that they were similar to
the modern relationships of the Trout Creek distributaries, lagoon areas within the Upper Truckee Marsh, and
Lake Tahoe.
Analysis of the standing-water areas in historical aerial photographs of the study area from 1930 to 2002 indicates
that although lake level is an important control on “lagoon” areas, other factors also affect natural lagoon areas.
Among these factors are groundwater levels, streamflows and overbanking, beach ridge height, and mouth depths
(Conservancy and DGS 2003:3-22, 3-23). The results suggest that natural lagoons were not directly connected to
the lake, except during flood events, or perhaps for a whole season in some years of very high lake levels.
Groundwater
Groundwater Basins
The study area is within the South Lake Tahoe groundwater basin, the area’s primary source of domestic and
public water supplies. Various monitoring programs and studies have focused on concerns about groundwater
withdrawals, wastewater disposal, and the water quality implications of interaction between groundwater and
surface water (Rowe and Allander 2000, USACE 2003). The most recent groundwater evaluation for the total
maximum daily load program (USACE 2003:4-1) places the study area within Subregion 3, Al Tahoe and Upper
Truckee Marsh, of the South Lake Tahoe/Stateline region.
Groundwater Conditions in the Trout Creek and Upper Truckee River Watersheds
As reported by USACE (2003:1-2), studies have documented that the water surface of groundwater in aquifers in
the Trout Creek and Upper Truckee River watersheds generally slopes toward the lake (i.e., with net flow toward
the lake). The watershed-scale groundwater flow paths include discharge through springs, small lakes, and
seepage to stream channels, along with direct discharge to the lake across the lakeshore (Thodal 1997:24).
Groundwater elevations in the watersheds generally parallel the topography, with higher elevations in the
headwaters and along ridgelines and lower elevations in the valleys and along the lake (Rowe and Allander
2000:36).
Observations from 1964 provide an estimate of the groundwater patterns that existed in the Upper Truckee River
and Trout Creek watersheds before substantial pumping began (STPUD 1999). These data indicate that the
natural groundwater slopes were steep in the upper reaches of the watersheds, but flattened out several miles
upstream of the lake (Exhibit 3.8-8). At the Upper Truckee Marsh, groundwater was higher than the lake level and
sloped toward the lake in both the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek portions of the marsh (Exhibit 3.8-8).
However, the estimated 1964 groundwater slope (gradient) was very low in the marsh—less than 10 feet per mile
(0.001 to 0.002 foot vertically per foot horizontally)—even though the lake was low (STPUD 1999). Still, a
shallow hydraulic slope under relatively undeveloped conditions is not unexpected. Such a slope could reflect the
low-gradient valley floor and the relatively low hydraulic conductivity (i.e., ability of a porous material to
transmit groundwater) of the lake bed and glacial outwash sediments that underlie the valley.

Regardless of the natural conditions, groundwater levels and patterns in the vicinity of the study area have
changed substantially since the 1960s. These changes have occurred largely because of varied pumping and the
construction of the Tahoe Keys (Loeb 1987, Thodal 1997:11–13). Depression of groundwater levels has occurred,
especially in the Trout Creek portions of the study area. Also, the distance to the lake’s open surface water was
effectively reduced by the construction of the keys channels, which altered the groundwater slopes (and thus the
rates of flow loss) to the lake on the west margin of the study area.
Local Groundwater Conditions
Groundwater monitoring data for the study area are limited to various short-term wells installed and observed by
the Conservancy during different time periods related to specific project studies and construction of the Lower
West Side (LWS) Restoration Area (Exhibit 3.8-9). Other short-term records exist from nearby research projects
(e.g., on Pope Marsh), and long-term groundwater information is available at nearby production and monitoring
wells (Exhibit 3.8-9).
Long-term data (1962–2007) from four California Department of Water Resources monitoring wells show the
relationships between local groundwater and lake levels (Exhibit 3.8-10). The groundwater levels are dynamic,
with seasonal shifts of a few feet (three–four feet) and year-to-year ranges of several feet. As might be expected,
the groundwater elevation roughly parallels lake level (USACE 2003:B-4). The same rising-and-falling cycles
over years occur in response to variations in watershed runoff and changes in pumping demand, both driven by
climatic conditions. Groundwater levels can rise and have risen during periods of relatively constant high lake
levels (e.g., 1966–1968 and 1995–1998) (Exhibit 3.8-10). Maximum groundwater levels are limited primarily by
local topography and aquifer properties, not by the elevation of the lake-rim outlet. Groundwater discharge from
the watershed, although slower than surface runoff, generally flows toward the lake. If precipitation levels are
high for several years, groundwater may continue to rise after surface runoff has diminished (Conservancy
2003:2-27).
The wells upslope and west of the study area (the Tallac Village and Tahoe Valley School wells) have historic
groundwater levels consistently higher than lake levels; since the late 1980s, however, they have shown some net
decline (fewer feet of difference from lake levels) (Exhibit 3.8-10). East of the Upper Truckee Marsh,
groundwater levels at one well (Al Tahoe West) have consistently been lower than lake levels, and another well’s
groundwater levels switched in the mid 1980s from generally similar to lake levels to consistently lower
(Exhibit 3.8-10). These conditions reflect pumping effects that locally decrease groundwater levels
(i.e., drawdown) and create slopes toward the production wells east of the study area (USACE 2003:B-5).
Because of the naturally low groundwater gradient and sustained pumping, net groundwater flow to the lake from
the study area is lower than net flow from neighboring subregions along the south shore (Exhibit 3.8-11).
Groundwater Conditions in the Study Area
The most important control on groundwater conditions within the Upper Truckee Marsh is Lake Tahoe, including
its artificially connected sections within the Tahoe Keys canal system. The lake is the major groundwater
discharge boundary; groundwater within the sediments of the marsh flows toward the lake margin, including the
Tahoe Keys. Therefore, groundwater levels (and gradients) within the unconfined aquifer under the marsh
respond to fluctuations in lake level. Notably, construction of the Tahoe Keys effectively moved the lake’s
hydraulic margin, creating a human-made discharge boundary within the marsh (at the western margin of the
study area). The distance to the discharge boundary from the interior of the marsh was shortened by construction
of the Tahoe Keys canals, increasing localized groundwater gradients from the marsh toward the Keys.
The primary recharge of groundwater in the marsh occurs as the result of down-valley flow of groundwater, with
some contributions from the local slopes at the margin of the study area. The Upper Truckee River is not the
primary control on groundwater conditions. Recent investigations have suggested that the lower portions of the
river are not predominantly “gaining” or “losing” reaches (with groundwater flowing into the channel or flowing

out of the river to the aquifer, respectively); the reach downstream of U.S. 50 is characterized as steady relative to
groundwater losses or gains (Rowe and Allander 2000:Plate 1). A more detailed investigation of conditions along
Trout Creek for the period 1996 to 2001 (Allander 2003:40) indicates that groundwater flow into or away from
the channel in the lower reach is variable depending on surface flow and lake level.
However, the river does temporarily and locally affect groundwater during particular seasonal conditions. During
periods when surface water in the channel remains above the elevation of the groundwater level in the
surrounding areas, water from the river may recharge the local aquifer (creating a “losing” river situation). During
periods of sustained low-flow conditions in the stream, groundwater may discharge to the river if the surrounding
groundwater levels are above the elevation of the low-flow channel (creating a “gaining” river situation).
The study area’s existing groundwater levels and flow patterns have been modified by direct disturbance to the
channel, and the channel’s natural geomorphic response to disturbance through incision and widening. The
incision of the channel has progressively lowered the transient discharge boundary that may occur during lowflow conditions. Therefore, that control on groundwater levels has been lowered relative to natural conditions, at
least in the corridor adjacent to the incised channel. The effect of lowering the groundwater surface is to reduce
the amount of groundwater storage space within the shallow aquifer beneath the marsh. The degraded channel
condition has also increased the seasonal fluctuation of groundwater levels throughout the natural floodplain by
reducing the amount of overbanking relative to more natural conditions. The reduced frequency of overbanking
and smaller area of inundation reduces the amount of recharge to shallow groundwater from water infiltrating the
marsh surface during and after overbanking events. All of these effects tend to reduce the availability of
groundwater for marsh and floodplain habitat.
Observations of groundwater conditions in the study area are available for recent years, the same years for which
vertical aerial photographs are available over a range of lake levels. These lake levels vary from extreme low
(1992) to legal maximum (1999) elevations, including median lake level under high-volume runoff (1995). With
these data, groundwater contours and approximate hydraulic slopes could be calculated for the study area
(Conservancy 2003:2-27 to 2-36).
The 1992 data set demonstrates that at times of low lake levels (6,220 feet NGVD) and low streamflow input,
groundwater along the incised Upper Truckee River was at or below the channel bed. There was a steep
groundwater slope northwest or west toward the Tahoe Keys channels, steeper than the groundwater gradient
north to Lake Tahoe. Groundwater in the middle marsh remained relatively high: about five feet above the lake
level (Conservancy and DGS 2003: Exhibit 2-23).
The 1995 data set demonstrates that for a period with Lake Tahoe at median lake level (6,225.8 feet NGVD) and
under high streamflow, groundwater levels onsite actually peaked before either the lake rise or streamflow. This
indicates that the groundwater onsite was recharged from groundwater flowing from up-valley areas and/or onsite snowpack/snowmelt. The groundwater slope was still to the northwest or west toward the Tahoe Keys
channels, but not as steep as during low lake levels. Small reversals of groundwater flow may have occurred west
of the existing Upper Truckee River channel when the lake level rose quickly. Under these conditions, net
groundwater flow would temporarily be from the Tahoe Keys Marina and channels toward the river. Groundwater
in the middle marsh remained about three–four feet above the lake (Conservancy and DGS 2003:Exhibits 2-24
and 2-25).
The 1999 data set demonstrates that when Lake Tahoe was at high lake level (6,228.9 feet NGVD) and moderate
streamflow occurred, groundwater levels onsite peaked before the spring runoff, perhaps because of on-site
snowpack/snowmelt. The groundwater slope was extremely gentle, and groundwater was higher than the lake, as
much as a couple of feet higher in spring. Groundwater in the middle marsh remained two–three feet above the
lake level (Conservancy and DGS 2003:Exhibit 2-26).

The relatively high groundwater levels in the middle marsh over the range of lake levels and river flows indicate
that, as expected, the groundwater supply from the upper watersheds is primarily discharging to the study area
along the ridge between the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek. The available data also suggest how important
the Tahoe Keys Marina channels are in controlling groundwater levels and slopes along the west side of the study
area. These excavated, open-water surfaces are connected to the lake. Therefore, they support high on-site
groundwater when lake levels are high but draw it down locally when lake levels are low. The pronounced
response of groundwater levels to changes in lake levels suggest that zones of high hydraulic conductivity
(possibly more coarse sediments) discharge groundwater along the western study area boundary.
Additional information about groundwater conditions and processes in the study area is available for water years
1995–1997. During this period, monitoring programs were conducted on both the Upper Truckee Marsh
(Conservancy 2003) and Pope Marsh (Green 1998). The Pope Marsh data demonstrate that upslope groundwater
and local surface water (including snowmelt) are the dominant sources of water to “fill” the marsh, but lake level
is an important control on the rate at which water drains out of the marsh (Green 1998). The Upper Truckee
Marsh data have similarities with the Pope Marsh data, including local groundwater depressions for the
monitoring wells closest to the Tahoe Keys (Conservancy and DGS 2003:Exhibits 2-21 and 2-22). Groundwater
was encountered in four of seven geotechnical boring locations in the study area in April 1995, at depths below
ground surface ranging from 3.75 feet to 10.0 feet (Marvin E. Davis and Associates 2005).
Flooding
Flooding is an important aspect of the hydrology of all river systems. It has a substantial influence on riparian
vegetation, bank stability, water quality, wildlife habitat, and channel morphology. When flood magnitudes are
large, property damage and safety risks can occur, particularly in developed areas. Although the Upper Truckee
Marsh study area is undeveloped, it is surrounded by developed land uses, so flooding that may span the valley, or
flooding along the margins of the study area, may result in flood hazards to urban structures and local residents.
Water begins to overtop channel banks (i.e., overbanking) when streamflow exceeds channel capacity, which is
about 1,000–1,500 cfs for the Upper Truckee River and about 150–200 cfs for Trout Creek, depending on the
specific locations within the study area. Over the 45-year period of record on these streams, several peak-flow
events have exceeded these magnitudes (Exhibit 3.8-12). Before the mid-1970s, there were few structures at risk
along the margins of the study area. During the following decades, however, flooding was reported in the Tahoe
Island subdivision (at Colorado Avenue, Colorado Court, Montezuma Street, and Michael Drive) and the Sky
Meadows subdivision, particularly for flows on the Upper Truckee River exceeding 1,400 cfs. As discussed
below, some of this historical flooding of residential neighborhoods resulted from internal problems with the
urban drainage system, and not simply from river flows crossing the floodplain. Along Trout Creek, only the most
extreme flows have affected any residential areas, with effects mostly limited to backyard flooding along
Edgewood Circle. The smaller overbank peak flows (less than approximately 1,400 cfs on the Upper Truckee
River and less than approximately 500 cfs on Trout Creek) occur every several years but have not been associated
with flood hazards.
Extreme peak flows associated with damaging floods on the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek are mostly,
but not entirely, associated with winter rain-on-snow conditions. These conditions occur during large winter
rainstorms when antecedent snowpack conditions add to the total runoff. Floods of moderate magnitude may
result from spring snowmelt events or rainstorms, or less intense rain-on-snow events. Flow from spring
snowmelt tends to be less extreme, because the snowpack melts gradually over the watershed’s various elevation
zones, moderating the peak flow arriving at a downstream location like the study area. Summer thunderstorms in
the Tahoe Basin are common and can be intense, but they are typically brief and cover only small portions of the
watersheds. They rarely produce substantial flooding or flood hazards in the vicinity of the study area (USACE
1999).

The flood of January 1–2, 1997, was triggered by rainfall that followed prior snowstorms (i.e., fell on top of the
existing snowpack). Heavy rain and melting snow resulted in high flows throughout the Tahoe Basin
(Conservancy and DGS 2005). This event was the largest flood of record at 21 of 31 USGS stream monitoring
sites in the Tahoe Basin (Crompton, Hess, and Williams 2002). For other sites in the basin, the largest historic
flood resulted from rainstorms during the spring or early-summer snowmelt (e.g., April and May 1973, May and
June 1995) (Crompton, Hess, and Williams 2002).
Flood Frequencies
Statistical analysis of either recorded or estimated flows, or both, is typically used to characterize various flood
events. Several hydrologic studies have developed flood statistics for the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek
using available data and standard methods for the specific purpose of each study (Table 3.8-2). These studies
produced estimates of the statistical frequency (expressed as either a probability of occurrence in any year or as a
return interval in years) and associated peak flow magnitudes (streamflow in cfs). High-magnitude flooding
events with the potential to inundate adjacent residential neighborhoods have long return intervals (e.g., 10-year,
25-year, 100-year), statistically meaning that the probability of occurrence is lower (i.e., they occur less
frequently).

The estimated magnitudes of the 100-year flood peaks (i.e., those with a one percent chance of occurring in a
given year) on the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek (Table 3.8-2) have changed over the years of study as
more data have become available and various methods have been applied. The January 1997 flood added
important information to the data set, but damage to the Upper Truckee River gauge and flow blockage at the
U.S. 50 crossing during the flood required that the peak flow be estimated (5,480 cfs by USGS and 8,200 cfs by

USACE). Based on independent analysis, ENTRIX validated the USACE estimate of 8,200 cfs as the most
probable flow for the 1997 extreme event (Conservancy and DGS 2003:8-15) and entered that value into the
statistical analysis. Therefore, the resulting flood hazard analysis for this project estimated a 100-year flood peak
of 7,650 cfs for the Upper Truckee River and 900 cfs for Trout Creek.
Using the same statistical data and analysis, peak-flow magnitudes for both streams in the study area have been
estimated over a wide range of expected return intervals (Table 3.8-3). Because these streams are unregulated
(i.e., no substantial dams or other flow-control structures exist upstream), the flow magnitudes and frequencies are
not managed, but occur as a function of climate and weather conditions, land use and vegetation cover, and
channel and floodplain characteristics. These flows represent the anticipated streamflow to the study area over the
life of the project if watershed hydrology is assumed to be similar to the hydrology of the last 35 years.

Historical flooding in adjacent residential areas has resulted from a combination of the flow magnitudes, the
location and elevation of homes, and street drainage systems, as well as the channel capacity and floodplain
topography. The interaction of these factors has caused urban flooding west of the Upper Truckee River (i.e., in
the Tahoe Island subdivision at Colorado Avenue, Colorado Court, Montezuma Street, and Michael Drive and the
Sky Meadows subdivision) at flows around or slightly less than the 5-year event, and in urban-fringe flooding east
of Trout Creek (i.e., Al Tahoe subdivision) at flows between the 10-year and 25-year events.
The following discussion of floodplain management and flood hazards focuses on larger-magnitude, lowerfrequency events of concern from a regulatory perspective (e.g., a 100-year event), but also includes evaluation of
smaller events known to have created flood nuisance or hazards in the vicinity (e.g., 5- to 10-year events). Further
discussion of the overbanking associated with small-magnitude, high-frequency events considered important to
active floodplain processes (e.g., 2-year events) is included in Section 3.9, “Geomorphology and Water Quality.”
Historical data suggest that, unlike spring snowmelt events, which tend to have staggered peak flows on the Upper
Truckee River and Trout Creek, major winter rainfall flood events produce peak flows on both streams on the
same day. Therefore, the flood hazard analysis for the study area combines the 100-year peaks of the Upper
Truckee River and Trout Creek channels (i.e., 8,550 cfs). The two flows would converge in the main floodplain
(marsh) as influenced by:

the lake’s water-surface elevation before the flood,

the configuration of the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek outlet(s) through the beach ridge, and

the amount of water stored in the entire floodplain (including the lagoon area south of Barton Beach) before
the flood.

Flooding and Floodplain Storage
Most of the study area is composed of the shared floodplain of the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek, which
has the potential to store a large amount of runoff during flood events. The floodplain is about one mile long and
about 0.5 mile wide, with about 14 acre-feet of storage volume at the legal maximum lake elevation of 6,229.0
feet (Conservancy and DGS 2005:6-1). It is bounded on the south and east by urbanized uplands, and on the west
by a combination of urbanized upland, urbanized floodplain, and the Tahoe Keys Marina. The northern boundary
of the floodplain is along the Barton Beach ridge, stretching from uplands west of the mouth of the Upper
Truckee River (in the former Cove East Beach dunes) to uplands east of East Barton Beach. The only perennial
(low-flow) outlet to the lake is the existing mouth of the Upper Truckee River, which was deepened by dredging
in the late 1950s to late 1960s. The Trout Creek system’s lagoon includes a separate mouth that was not dredged
and is not active as a low-flow channel to Lake Tahoe. As shown in historic aerial photography (Conservancy and
DGS 2003), Trout Creek has historically breached the Barton Beach ridge during large flood events; this breach
typically stays open to discharge directly to the lake during high flows and high lake levels. Extreme flood events
may overtop additional parts of the barrier beach, via the combined effects of high streamflow and floodplain
(lagoon) water levels, and storm wave action on both the lake and the lagoon.
Lake Level Effects
Several aspects of hydrology in the study area are directly affected by lake level, and flood hydrology is no
exception. As Lake Tahoe rises above its median level, floodplain storage is reduced because the mouth of the
Upper Truckee River (and other low portions of the Barton Beach ridge) allows lake water to fill in the lowelevation areas of the marsh (Exhibit 3.8-13). About 1,000 feet of lower Trout Creek and as much as 5,000 feet of
the Upper Truckee River would have reduced channel capacity under lake backwater conditions (Conservancy
and DGS 2003:8-9). The area of lake backwater is a small percentage of the total floodplain storage when the lake
is near median elevation (i.e., 6,225–6,226 feet). However, during high lake levels (i.e., 6,228–6,229 feet), 25
percent or more of floodplain storage could be taken up by lake backwater. The increase in area affected by
backwater effects reflects the low surface gradient of the marsh.
Because of the Upper Truckee River’s channel-lake connection through the straightened reach, high lake levels
can also interfere with urban drainage during floods. The backwater can submerge the Colorado Avenue outlet by
about two feet, possibly affecting sump performance.
Bridge Effects
The bridge at U.S. 50 also limits the maximum streamflow of both the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek as
they enter the study area. Bridge replacements and repairs by the California Department of Transportation over
the years (as recently as 1996–1997) used the original bridge-capacity designs from the early 1900s, to avoid
litigation in case bridge modifications would have altered upstream or downstream discharge. The effects of
constriction by the bridge during high flows would be reflected in the historic gauge records and flood-frequency
analysis for the Upper Truckee River (Tables 3.8-2 and 3.8-3) because the gauge is downstream of the bridge.

Drainage Effects
Topography and urban drainage systems in the developed areas that surround the study area can also affect
flooding on the margins of the study area. Flooding problems have occurred primarily on the west side of the
study area in the Tahoe Island and Sky Meadows areas. In these areas, urban development occurred within the
topographic floodplain, but before implementation of federal regulations that prohibit development or require
specific flood protections in the 100-year floodplain. The installed street drainage infrastructure includes a sump
pump system that discharges water into the Upper Truckee River. The system has been modified and updated
over the years. Occasionally the system has failed, resulting in localized street flooding (Gibson, pers. comm.,
2002; Rodgers, pers. comm., 1999; Conservancy and DGS 2003:8-7). Such problems can occur during intense
thunderstorms, or when winter snow and ice impede drainage even if the river is not flooding. However, serious
flooding in these neighborhoods is most often associated with major rain-on-snow events that also cause
generalized flooding on the main floodplain.
FEMA Floodplain
The regulatory floodplain identified by FEMA is land temporarily inundated by water overflowing from an
adjacent or nearby river or stream during the identified “base flood,” in this case the 100-year flood.
The regulatory floodplain consists of the floodway and margins of the floodplain, which are called the flood
fringe. The floodway is where the water is likely to be deepest and fastest, and is considered the zone of highest
flood hazard. As specifically defined by FEMA (44 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 59.1[d]), a floodway is
the channel of a river or other watercourse, and the adjacent land areas, that must be reserved to convey and
discharge floodwaters. This area within the floodplain should be kept free of all obstructions to allow floodwaters
to flow freely downstream. Therefore, development in or modification of a floodway is usually prohibited. The
flood fringe is a zone of floodwater storage where water moves slowly or is ponded during flooding.
Development within the flood fringe is permitted by FEMA as long as the resulting water-surface profile of the
100-year flood is not increased by more than one foot at any location.
Floodplain Boundaries and Water Elevations
The boundaries of the 100-year floodplain and estimated water-surface elevations and floodway boundaries in the
study area (Exhibit 3.8-14) are from FEMA’s 2008 Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FEMA 2008a, 2008b, 2008c).
This regulatory floodplain is used by FEMA and CSLT in implementing floodplain development regulations. The
mapping reflects revisions to the 1978 FIRM following land use changes in and around the study area, including
improvements to the U.S. 50 bridges at the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek crossings, additional urban
development, record peak flood events, and restoration of the LWS Restoration Area. Additionally, a Letter of
Map Revision (LOMR) was prepared in 2009 on the basis of updated topographic information for the Tahoe Keys
and Lake Tallac area (FEMA 2009). The LOMR revised flood zone mapping in the northwest corner of the study
area but did not revise the base flood elevations.
Nearly all of the study area is in the 100-year floodplain, except the uplands adjacent to the Highland Woods
subdivision, between Cove East Beach and the Sailing Lagoon, and along the margins of the Tahoe Keys Marina
(Exhibit 3.8-14). The Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek channels, adjacent areas, and the shared floodplain in
the central meadow are the designated floodway. The FEMA base flood elevations in the Upper Truckee River
marsh range from approximately 6,243 feet NGVD (6,247 feet NAVD [North American Vertical Datum], used by
FEMA) at the U.S. 50 crossing, to approximately 6,230 feet NGVD (6,234 feet NAVD) near the mouth of the
river.
Some residential areas adjacent to the study area (a couple of streets in Tahoe Island and some lots in Sky
Meadows) are within the floodplain fringe west of the Upper Truckee River. A few lots in Al Tahoe (along
El Dorado Avenue, Edgewood Circle, and Lilly Avenue) are along the edge of the regulatory floodplain east of
Trout Creek (Exhibit 3.8-14).

Flood Profiles for the Upper Truckee River
Hydraulic modeling has been performed for the study area to estimate flood boundaries and elevations, using the
USACE Hydraulic Engineering Center’s River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model (Version 3.1.2) in
combination with geographic information system (GIS) applications (ArcView and HEC-GeoRAS) (Conservancy
2003, Conservancy and DGS 2005).This modeling routed the large and assumed concurrent peak-flow
hydrographs for both the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek through the study area, and included the effects of
changing floodplain storage on resulting water surface elevations. The worst-case analysis assumed a high lake
level (6,229 feet). The modeled flood hydrographs spanned the 5-year to 100-year events, and thus covered the
range of flows that are likely to be associated with flood hazards.
The flood model was calibrated using field markings in Sky Meadows and Colorado Court from the January 1997
event (Conservancy and DGS 2005:6-10, 6-11). Photographs, homeowners’ recollections, and remaining flood
debris/damage marks were used to field-survey water levels from the 1997 event. (The survey occurred in 2000.)
Simulated water surface elevations were generated by model runs that used the range of estimated peak flow for
the 1997 event. Comparison of the field-surveyed water surface data to the simulated elevations supported
calibration of the model (Table 3.8-4).

The calibrated results of the hydraulic modeling include profiles of the existing channel bed, banks, and
floodwater surfaces of the Upper Truckee River (Exhibit 3.8-15). As discussed above, the channel’s capacity is
large enough to contain the 5-year event in the upstream portion of the study area between U.S. 50 and the “big
bend.” The 5-year floodwater surface is about equal to the bank heights from the “big bend” to just upstream of
the Colorado Avenue outfall. Downstream of this area, the 5-year water surface is higher than the east bank and
higher than the west bank in some short reaches, including the restored LWS wetland. As expected, the 100-year
water surface elevation exceeds the bank heights throughout the project reach, with the exception of the reserved
fill “islands” along the restored LWS wetlands.
Seismically Generated Waves
Seismic shaking during earthquakes can cause waves to form within open bodies of water. The two major types of
seismically generated waves are tsunamis and seiches.
Tsunamis are waves generated by the displacement of a large volume of water and thus occur only in large water
bodies such as oceans, bays, or large lakes. Displacements of water can be caused by several phenomena
(including subaqueous landsliding or explosions), but the most common are submarine displacements of the
earth’s crust that result from earthquakes.

A seiche is a wave that oscillates in a lake, bay, or gulf for a few minutes to a few hours as a result of seismic or
atmospheric disturbances. Small seiches are almost always present on larger lakes; the frequency of the oscillation
is determined by the size of the body, its depth and contours, and the water temperature. Larger seiches can be
caused by nearby or distant earthquakes and occur when the wave signature of the seismic waves is resonant with
the natural period (controlled by basin geometry) of the lake.
Recent investigations of the tectonic and seismic conditions within the Lake Tahoe region indicate the potential
for moderate to large earthquakes that may generate strong to very strong seismic shaking in the study area. (See
Section 3.6, “Geology and Soils, Mineral Resources, and Land Capability and Coverage.”) The West Tahoe and
North Tahoe–Incline Village Faults are considered active and capable of generating magnitude (M) 7 or greater
earthquakes (Schweickert et al. 2004). Another important seismic source in the vicinity of the study area is the
Genoa Fault. This fault, which forms the eastern boundary of the Carson Range, is considered capable of
generating large earthquakes (M 7.2 to 7.5). The probability of an M 7 earthquake occurring within the next 50
years in the South Lake Tahoe area has been estimated by the Nevada Earthquake Safety Council to be between
10 and 12 percent (NESC 2007).
Occurrence of such seismic events may result in the formation of tsunamis within Lake Tahoe. The amplitudes
(i.e., wave heights) of these seismically induced waves are expected to be on the order of 3–10 meters (10–30
feet). Additionally, the earthquakes may generate large seiches within the lake for hours after the events (Ichinose
et al. 2000).

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA
For this analysis, significance criteria are based on the checklist presented in Appendix G of the State CEQA
Guidelines; the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist; factual or scientific information and data; and regulatory
standards of federal, state, and local agencies. Below are outlined the significance criteria for CEQA, NEPA, and
TRPA. Each agency assigns significance to its criteria in different ways. For this document an impact is
considered to be a physical change in the environment and is considered significant under TRPA and CEQA and
adverse under NEPA, if the conditions described below would occur.
CEQA Criteria
Under CEQA, an alternative was determined to result in a significant effect related to hydrology if it would:
►

substantially deplete groundwater supplies or interfere substantially with groundwater recharge such that there
would be a net deficit in aquifer volume or a lowering of the local groundwater table level (e.g., the
production rate of preexisting nearby wells would drop to a level that would not support existing land uses or
planned uses for which permits have been granted) (CEQA 1);

►

substantially alter the existing drainage pattern of the site or area, including through the alteration of the
course of a stream or river, in a manner that would result in substantial erosion or siltation on- or off-site
(CEQA 2);

►

substantially alter the existing drainage pattern of the site or area, including through the alteration of the
course of a stream or river, or substantially increase the rate or amount of surface runoff in a manner that
would result in flooding on- or off-site (CEQA 3);

►

create or contribute runoff water that would exceed the capacity of existing or planned stormwater drainage
systems or provide substantial additional sources of polluted runoff (CEQA 4);

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Hydrology and Flooding

3.8-32

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

►

place housing within a 100-year flood hazard area as mapped on a federal flood hazard boundary or FIRM or
other flood hazard delineation map (CEQA 5);

►

place within a 100-year flood hazard area structures that would impede or redirect flood flows (CEQA 6);

►

expose people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury, or death involving flooding, including flooding
as a result of the failure of a levee or dam (CEQA 7); or

►

expose people or structures to a significant risk of inundation by seiche, tsunami, or mudflow (CEQA 8).

NEPA Criteria
An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the
environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the proposed action. Under NEPA, the significance
of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account
under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are
encompassed by the CEQA criteria used for this analysis. NEPA requires documentation and discussion of any
beneficial effects of a project in addition to its negative impacts. Where appropriate, these beneficial effects are
discussed and called out specifically for the purposes of NEPA in the following impact analysis.
TRPA Criteria
Based on TRPA’s Initial Environmental Checklist, an alternative would result in a significant impact for
hydrology and flooding if it would result in any of the following:
►

changes in currents, or the course or direction of water movements (TRPA 1);

►

changes in absorption rates, drainage patterns, or the rate and amount of surface water runoff so that a 20­
year, 1-hour storm runoff (approximately one inch per hour) cannot be contained on the site (TRPA 2);

►

alterations to the course or flow of 100-year floodwaters (TRPA 3);

►

change in the amount of surface water in any water body (TRPA 4);

►

alteration of the direction or rate of flow of groundwater (TRPA 5);

►

change in the quantity of groundwater, either through direct additions or withdrawals, or through interception
of an aquifer by cuts or excavations (TRPA 6);

►

substantial reduction in the amount of water otherwise available for public water supplies (TRPA 7); or

►

exposure of people or property to water-related hazards such as flooding and/or wave action from 100-year
storm occurrence or seiches (TRPA 8).

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
The impact analysis examines the effects of each alternative in the short term and long term for each issue and
topic listed above. Temporary effects are those that could occur over hours, days, or weeks during the active
construction phase. Because the river system is expected to experience adjustments after construction, the analysis
of temporary effects also looks at the potential for interim effects during construction or the first three–five years
after construction (assuming that streamflows are at least average), or until the first moderately large flood event
(approximately ten-year peak flow).

A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was used in the impact analysis. The analysis was
performed by a team of hydrologists/geomorphologists experienced in river restoration generally and the Tahoe
Basin environment specifically. Information about the study area and vicinity and the analysts’ professional
experience on similar projects has been incorporated into the analysis of the river system’s history, existing
conditions, likely future conditions, and conditions expected under each action alternative. Groundwater
dewatering impacts are described in Section 3.9, “Geomorphology and Water Quality.”
The results of hydraulic modeling of the study area and the initial alternatives, completed by ENTRIX (2006), are
incorporated into this impact analysis. These results provide information about water surface elevations,
boundaries of the inundation area, flow depths, and average velocity, allowing a comparison between existing
conditions and a restored-channel alternative.
The effects of climate change on future hydrology have been incorporated into the evaluation of the No­
Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5). However, even the most geographically and temporally focused
available forecasts of climate change effects on hydrologic parameters (Tetra Tech 2007) are relatively variable
and substantially uncertain. Therefore, the possible influences of various climate change scenarios, not just the
core/central scenario, are considered in this analysis. Because of the degree of uncertainty and because the
influences vary by scenario, the statements are expressed only in qualitative terms.

EFFECTS NOT DISCUSSED FURTHER IN THIS EIR/EIS/EIS
Placing Housing within a 100-Year Flood Hazard Area (CEQA 5)—The proposed alternatives would not
place any new housing or buildings within the existing FEMA flood hazard area; therefore, no impact related to
placing housing within a 100-year flood hazard area would occur. Other possible changes related to flooding
hazards to existing housing are fully discussed below.
Failure of a Levee or Dam (CEQA 7, in part)—The study area is not within an identified dam-failure
inundation zone or near any constructed levees; therefore, no flood hazard related to failure of a levee or dam
would occur. Other possible changes related to flooding are fully discussed below.
Landslide or Mudflow Risks (CEQA 8, in part)—The study area is located within an area of relatively gentle
topography within the alluvial valley of the Upper Truckee River. The potential for landslides or mudflows within
this setting is low. Slope failures are restricted to small rotational slides or slumps along the river banks resulting
from erosion processes.
Short-Term Dewatering of Surface Water Features (TRPA 4, in part)—Major construction activities would
require temporary dewatering or bypassing of work areas along the Upper Truckee River, the Sailing Lagoon, and
other surface water within the study area. Although these activities may result in temporary changes to the amount
of water in the surface water features of the study area, they would not result in any long-term changes to surface
water. Hydrologic effects would be less than significant. Temporary dewatering and water diversion effects on
aquatic biological resources are discussed in Section 3.5, “Fisheries.”

3.8-1
(Alt. 1)

Increased Runoff Volumes and Peak Flows. (CEQA 3, 4; TRPA 1, 2) Implementing Alternative 1 would
require construction of impervious surfaces at several discrete and dispersed locations within the study area
for trails, viewpoints, observation areas, boardwalks, and kiosks. As described in Environmental Commitment
11, permanent stormwater detention features or infiltration systems and other BMPs would be incorporated into
the final design to accommodate all 20-year, 1-hour storm runoff without erosion. This impact would be less
than significant.

New facilities constructed at several discrete and dispersed locations under Alternative 1—a parking lot, new
trails, kiosks, viewpoints and observation areas, a boardwalk, and a pedestrian bridge—would include impervious
or partially pervious surfaces. Constructing these features would incrementally and locally change runoff flow
volumes and direction. However, implementing Alternative 1 would also involve conversion of existing
impervious areas, including the Tahoe Keys Property Owners Association (TKPOA) Corporation Yard and its
access road.
Changes in land coverage are analyzed in Impact 3.6-3 (Alt. 1) in Section 3.6, “Geology and Soils, Mineral
Resources, and Land Capability and Coverage.” As stated in Impact 3.6-3 (Alt. 1), the proposed coverage is less
than the allowable coverage in the study area. For areas outside the litigation parcels coverage relocation would be
completed at a 1:1 ratio, as allowed for this type of project by the TRPA Code. The hydrologic changes resulting
from construction of impervious coverage would be minimized.
Construction under Alternative 1 would modify the type of impervious surfaces on portions of the site from soft
coverage (compacted soil) to hard coverage (e.g., asphalt, boardwalks). However, if permanent BMPs were
installed for the proposed facilities, the 20-year, 1-hour storm runoff from these locations could still be contained.
Compliance with stormwater regulations would require BMPs, but Alternative 1 does not specify the design or
location of BMPs for the proposed facilities. Therefore, runoff volumes and peak flows could change
incrementally on portions of the site.
However, implementing Environmental Commitment (EC) 11, “Incorporate Effective Permanent Stormwater
Best Management Practices,” described in Table 2-6 in Chapter 2, would ensure that the final project design
would include stormwater detention features or infiltration systems for runoff from areas of proposed impervious
surfaces (i.e., pavement, buildings, laid stone, bridge deck). These detention or infiltration facilities would be
sized to accommodate all 20-year, 1-hour storm runoff from each developed portion of the site. In addition, the
final design of partially impervious surfaces (i.e., trails, boardwalks) would incorporate materials and methods to
minimize changes to existing infiltration capacity. The detention or infiltration facilities and the partially
impervious surfaces would include features to convey runoff safely to discharge points without erosion, and they
would be maintained over the life of the project. These measures would reduce the effect of the incremental
increase in runoff that may result from constructing impervious surfaces. This impact would be less than
significant.
IMPACT
3.8-2
(Alt. 1)

Effects on Channels from Reconfiguration of Stream Channels and Lagoon Surface Water Features.
(NEPA) Implementing Alternative 1 would move portions of the Upper Truckee River channel, reconnect the
Sailing Lagoon with the river, and reconstruct the East Barton Lagoon, which would reconfigure the study
area’s drainage patterns. The change to drainage patterns would reestablish the site’s naturally occurring
surface water features and hydrologic/hydraulic processes. This impact would be beneficial.

Implementing Alternative 1 would involve directly modifying surface water features in the study area to
counteract and/or compensate for past actions and the degraded existing condition. These modifications would
include reconfiguring two lagoons to restore natural hydrologic function in both lagoon areas. In addition,
constructing new channel features would increase floodplain connectivity and improve floodplain processes.
Relocating the low-flow channel would affect internal drainage patterns on this portion of the site, but would not
substantially affect off-site drainage patterns or the quantity of water in surface water features.
The relocation of the river’s low-flow channel sections that would occur under Alternative 1 is within the range of
historic locations on-site, and the changes to drainage patterns would not affect off-site drainage or the amount of
water in any surface water body. Reconnecting the Sailing Lagoon to the river and reconstructing the East Barton
Lagoon would reestablish surface water features and drainage patterns in the study area that occurred historically
and would not adversely affect off-site drainage or the amount of water in any off-site water bodies. Therefore,
this impact would be beneficial.

IMPACT
3.8-3
(Alt. 1)

Modified 100-Year Flood Flow Directions or Floodplain Boundaries. (CEQA 7; TRPA 3, 8) Implementing
Alternative 1 would decrease the channel capacity, raise the streambed elevation, lower the streambank
heights and lengthen the channel, but would also enlarge floodplain storage because fill would be excavated in
some areas of the FEMA regulatory floodway or floodplain. As a net result, the boundaries and depth of
flooding in the 100-year flood hazard area would not increase in the study area. However, constructing the
bridge and boardwalk across the river and marsh could locally obstruct flood flow and increase flood levels and
flood hazards. The final design of the bridge and boardwalk would be determined through iterative modeling
and review by multiple agencies to ensure that the extent or elevation of the 100-year special flood hazard
area as designated by FEMA would not be adversely modified. This impact would be less than significant.

Implementing Alternative 1 would decrease the low-flow channel capacity, directly raise the streambed elevation,
lower streambank heights, and increase the length of the Upper Truckee River channel in the study area to
beneficially increase the frequency and extent of overbanking onto the floodplain under low to moderate flood
events (i.e., 2-year and 5-year events). Proposed changes include constructing grade control structures to promote
bed aggradation, constructing geomorphically sized channels, and enlarging floodplain storage by removing fill
(approximately 23,000 cubic yards).
A hydraulic analysis of the study area was conducted to estimate potential changes in floodwater surface
elevations, flows, and floodplain boundaries for the 100-year flood under Alternatives 1, 2, 3, and 4 (Conservancy
and DGS 2005). The results of the modeling indicate that the water surface elevation for the 100-year event under
Alternative 1 would be the same as or lower than the existing 100-year water surface (labeled as ‘original’ in the
graphic). Based on existing topography at the floodplain margins, increased flood storage created by Alternative 1
would generally reduce the width of the flood area of the 100-year flood fringe. The proposed restoration efforts
described above would not raise floodwater surfaces for the 100-year flood event within the study area, nor would
they increase flood hazards in the surrounding area.
However, the proposed bridge upstream of the mouth of the Upper Truckee River (River Station [RS] 10+00) and
the raised boardwalk across the marsh were not evaluated in the hydraulic modeling. Bridge footings and
abutments and boardwalk supports could potentially obstruct flow, causing incremental increases in flood
elevation. The designated floodway in the study area includes broad areas of the lower marsh, as well as the
channels of the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek (Exhibit 3.8-14). The elements of the final design of the
proposed bridge and boardwalk would ensure that these structures would not obstruct flood flows, to the degree
that any effective increase in the elevation of the 100-year event would occur in the study area. The final design
would be supported by a hydraulic analysis that would evaluate the potential for substantial changes to flooding
hazards and littoral processes. Design elements (e.g., deck height, locations of bridge or boardwalk supports, and
cross-sectional areas of those supports) would be adjusted to ensure that flow capacity through the structures
would be sufficient to pass the 100-year event without increasing the effective flood elevation. The final design
would be submitted to CSLT for review and approval. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.8-4
(Alt. 1)

Increased Overbank Flooding for Small Streamflow Events. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 1 would
decrease the channel capacity, raise the streambed elevation, and lower the streambank heights to enlarge
the area of overbank flooding for small (760-cfs) streamflow events within the study area by about 11 acres.
This effect would reestablish natural connections between the low-flow channel and the floodplain/marsh
surface. This impact would be beneficial.

The design of Alternative 1 provides for increased overbank flows during relatively frequent, small flood events
(i.e., the 2-year event). Implementing Alternative 1 would decrease the Upper Truckee River’s channel capacity,
raise the bed elevation, lower bank heights, and increase the length of the channel, thus enlarging the portion of
the study area inundated under the existing 2-year return interval flow (e.g., 760 cfs). The existing area of
inundation during a 2-year event is about 64 acres (see Table 3.8-5); the channel and floodplain modifications
proposed by Alternative 1 would increase this area to about 74 acres. The increase in inundation is proposed to

improve the connectivity of the floodplain and marsh surface to the river channel. More frequent and expanded
inundation would benefit riparian and marsh wildlife habitat and vegetation. The expanded inundation area would
not include any existing or proposed structures.

In the long term, the watershed’s response to climate change could reduce typical streamflows and the magnitude
of the peak streamflow expected frequently (i.e., every couple of years). Implementing Alternative 1 would
improve overbanking at specific streamflow magnitudes, but watershed hydrology shifts caused by climate
change might reduce the frequency with which those flows would occur. The uncertain but possible hydrologic
effects of climate change could partially offset the benefits of Alternative 1. Still, Alternative 1 would reestablish
natural hydrologic/hydraulic processes and result in an improvement relative to existing conditions. Therefore,
this impact would be beneficial.
IMPACT
3.8-5
(Alt. 1)

Modified Groundwater Levels and Flow Patterns. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 1 would modify the size,
shape, and location of the Upper Truckee River and change the surface connections and subsurface
conditions around the channels and lagoons, which could change groundwater levels and flow patterns. This
effect would partially counteract the historic effects on groundwater levels and flow patterns on the west side of
the study area caused by dredging of the Tahoe Keys waterways. This impact would be beneficial.

Implementing Alternative 1 would involve directly raising channel bed elevations and backfilling existing incised
channels, which would allow for higher groundwater levels and better groundwater continuity across the study
area. In addition, the stream channels would be modified to increase overbank flows across the floodplain, which
would enhance opportunities for groundwater recharge within the study area. These actions would not directly
counteract the historic effects on groundwater levels and flow patterns on the west side of the study area caused
by dredging of the Tahoe Keys waterways, which would remain in place. However, the actions would restore
groundwater storage opportunities and flow patterns previously altered by dredging and straightening of the
Upper Truckee River channel and by the river’s geomorphic adjustments to watershed disturbances (i.e., incision
and widening).
Alternative 1 would keep the active Upper Truckee River channel close to the existing alignment, near the
previously dredged waterways of the Tahoe Keys. Implementing this alternative would not effectively change the
groundwater loss that occurs toward those artificial channels during low lake stands under existing conditions.
This would result in an improvement relative to existing conditions. Therefore, this impact would be beneficial.
IMPACT
3.8-6
(Alt. 1)

Exposure to Seismically Generated Wave Hazards. (CEQA 8, TRPA 8) Alternative 1 proposes recreation
improvements within the study area that could be damaged by seismically generated waves that could develop
in Lake Tahoe. The most important hazard would be presented by a tsunami caused by a large local
earthquake, rather than by seiche waves of varied sources. The potential for exposure of people or structures
to the effects of a tsunami would be low. This impact would be less than significant.

Alternative 1 proposes the development of recreational facilities within and at the margins of the Upper Truckee
Marsh. The area is adjacent and graded to Lake Tahoe. The topography throughout the study area is relatively flat
to gently sloping. The results of recent evaluations of seismic hazards indicate that faults within or near the Tahoe

Basin are capable of generating large earthquakes (NESC 2007). The occurrence of such earthquakes could result
in the development of tsunamis with amplitudes of 10–30 feet (Ichinose 2000). A tsunami could also be generated
in Lake Tahoe if a large landslide were to occur within or adjacent to the lake.
No accurate estimates are available to indicate the probability of a tsunami or the tsunami runup height at the
study area. However, if a tsunami of this magnitude were to occur, it would likely overtop the barrier beach berm
along the northern margin of the site and inundate much of the study area. The improvements most vulnerable to
damage by a tsunami are the boardwalk proposed for the northern margin, the foot bridge over the river channel,
the restored Sailing Lagoon, and the dune restoration area at Cove East Beach. Most other improvements would
be inundated and may be damaged by only the largest of the estimated range of tsunamis. Visitors at the study
area could be injured during inundation by a tsunami.
A variety of conditions, including nearby and distant earthquakes, could result in the development of seiches in
Lake Tahoe. The amplitude (size) of possible seiches would vary, but no condition would be expected to generate
seiches of the size of estimated tsunamis, as described above. Alternative 1 does not propose the construction of
structures for human occupation, limiting the duration of potential human exposure to tsunami risks.
Project components would be constructed in an area that already supports urban development and recreational
facilities, including residential housing and a marina, and users of the public-access facilities are expected to be
people who already reside or recreate in the Tahoe Basin. Therefore, constructing the proposed improvements
would not expose additional people to tsunami hazards. Furthermore, there is no way of knowing whether a
tsunami with enough force to damage project improvements or to present a safety hazard to recreational users
would ever be generated during the lifetime of the project facilities. The potential damage to the improvements
(i.e., flooding and erosion) could be repaired. Because of the low probability of a tsunami occurring in Lake
Tahoe, the relatively low human use of the study area, and the reparability of expected damage, this impact would
be less than significant.
Alternative 2: New Channel—West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure)
IMPACT
3.8-1
(Alt. 2)

Increased Runoff Volumes and Peak Flows. (CEQA 3, 4; TRPA 1, 2) Implementing Alternative 2 would
require construction of impervious surfaces at several discrete and dispersed locations within the study area
for trails, fishing access areas, and viewpoints. As described in Environmental Commitment 11, permanent
stormwater detention features or infiltration systems and other BMPs would be incorporated into the final
design to accommodate all 20-year, 1-hour storm runoff without erosion. This impact would be less than
significant.

This impact would be similar to Impact 3.8-1 (Alt. 1) but of smaller extent and magnitude, as described below.
Implementing Alternative 2 would require construction of impervious surfaces at several discrete and dispersed
locations within the study area for new trails, fishing access areas, and viewpoints. However, construction of these
surfaces would be offset by the restoration of existing trails and removal of impervious cover and compacted fill
within the TKPOA Corporation Yard.
Changes in land coverage are analyzed in Impact 3.6-3 (Alt. 2) in Section 3.6, “Geology and Soils, Mineral
Resources, and Land Capability and Coverage.” As stated in Impact 3.6-3 (Alt. 2), the proposed coverage is less
than the allowable coverage in the study area. For areas outside the litigation parcels coverage relocation would be
completed at a 1:1 ratio and therefore would comply with the TRPA Code.
The features of Alternative 2 would increase the volume of runoff generated within portions of the study area and
would locally redirect or increase peak flows. These runoff changes would occur in only small portions of the
study area, and it is unlikely that increased flow volumes and peaks would be released off-site (e.g., into the storm
drainage system and ultimately into Lake Tahoe).

As described for Alternative 1, EC 11 (Table 2-6) would be implemented. This environmental commitment would
involve installing permanent BMPs, stormwater detention features, or infiltration systems that would convey
runoff safely to discharge points and would be maintained over the life of the project. These measures would
reduce the effect of the incremental increase in runoff that may result from constructing impervious surfaces as
part of Alternative 2. This impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.8-2
(Alt. 2)

Effects on Channels from Reconfiguration of Stream Channels and Lagoon Surface Water Features.
(NEPA) Implementing Alternative 2 would move portions of the Upper Truckee River channel, reconnect the
Sailing Lagoon with the river, and reconstruct the East Barton Lagoon, which would reconfigure the study
area’s drainage patterns. The change to drainage patterns would reestablish the site’s naturally occurring
surface water features and hydrologic/hydraulic processes. This impact would be beneficial.

Implementing Alternative 2 would involve directly modifying surface water features in the study area to
counteract and/or compensate for past actions and the degraded existing condition. Alternative 2 would also make
the same changes to the surface water lagoons as Alternative 1 (see Impact 3.8-2 [Alt. 1]).
In addition, new channel features would be constructed and some of the existing floodplain areas would be
modified to conditions similar to those that existed historically in portions of the site. These measures would
improve the degraded surface water functions and values by restoring floodplain processes to large areas of the
existing terrace surface.
Alternative 2 would also involve constructing about 8,420 feet of sinuous single-thread channel to replace the
degraded existing channel (between RS 21+00 and RS 96+00) and the straightened reach adjacent to the LWS
Wetlands Restoration Project area. This would move the low-flow channel up to 500 feet to the west of its
existing location between RS 21+00 and 39+00, and up to 500 feet to the east between RS 39 +00 and 96+00.
However, these relocations would still be within the range of location(s) of the positions of historically active
low-flow channel(s). Relocating the low-flow channel would affect internal drainage patterns on this portion of
the site, but would not affect off-site drainage patterns or the quantity of water in surface water features.
Also, Alternative 2 would involve reconfiguring the previously dredged mouth of the Upper Truckee River by
constructing approximately 400 feet of new channel downstream of RS 96+00 and a new, smaller, higher
elevation mouth. This would move the low-flow channel and river mouth as much as 200 feet west of its existing
location, although it would still be within the range of location(s) of the historically active low-flow channel(s)
and mouth. Relocating the low-flow channel would affect internal drainage patterns on this portion of the site, but
would not affect off-site drainage patterns or the quantity of water in surface water features.
Relocating the river mouth under this alternative would modify the drainage patterns along the beach ridge and
lake shoreline because it would move the river’s discharge point to the new location. At times when the lake level
is between the median elevation (6,226 feet NGVD) and existing river-mouth elevation (6,222 feet NGVD), the
relocated, higher-elevation river mouth would discharge less water from the river to Lake Tahoe. The amount of
river water discharged to the lake would not change when the lake level is below the existing river mouth or
above the median elevation. The modified river mouth would retain proportionally more surface water within the
lagoon and marsh system during moderately low lake level conditions (median to low) than under the existing
dredged-mouth condition. Although these drainage patterns differ from the existing condition, they are within the
range of historic conditions and would be typical of a river mouth within a naturally functioning barrier beach
system. The proposed reduction of the capacity and elevation of the river mouth and improved water quality (i.e.,
reduction of transport of fine sediment to the littoral zone) would generally improve littoral processes by returning
the river-lake conditions to a more natural configuration.
Alternative 2 would reestablish the same connection between the Sailing Lagoon and the Upper Truckee River
near the river mouth as Alternative 1. Alternative 2 would also result in reconstruction of a back-beach lagoon
behind East Barton Beach as described for Alternative 1.

Relocation of the river’s low-flow channel sections as described above would present conditions falling within the
range of historic conditions on-site. The changes to drainage patterns would not affect off-site drainage or the
amount of water in any surface water body. Reconnecting the Sailing Lagoon to the river and reconstructing the
East Barton Lagoon would reestablish surface water features and drainage patterns in the study area that occurred
historically and would not adversely affect off-site drainage or the amount of water in any off-site water bodies.
Therefore, this impact would be beneficial.

Modified 100-Year Flood Flow Directions or Floodplain Boundaries. (CEQA 7; TRPA 3, 8) Implementing
Alternative 2 would decrease the channel capacity, raise the streambed elevation, lower the streambank
heights, and modify flow routes, but would enlarge floodplain storage because fill would be excavated in some
areas within the FEMA regulatory floodway or floodplain. As a net result, the extent or elevation of the 100-year
special flood hazard area as designated by FEMA would not be adversely modified. This impact would be less
than significant.

Implementing Alternative 2 would decrease the low-flow channel capacity, directly raise the streambed elevation,
lower streambank elevations and increase the length of the Upper Truckee River channel in the study area.
Proposed actions that would decrease existing floodplain storage would include filling abandoned channels and
reducing the mouth of the river. These losses in floodplain storage would be offset by other actions proposed by
Alternative 2, including creating areas of lowered floodplain along some of the new channels and removing fill at
the LWS Restoration Area and the TKPOA Corporation Yard and behind East Barton Beach. This alternative
would also reconnect the Sailing Lagoon to Upper Truckee River flows.
A hydraulic analysis of the study area was conducted to estimate potential changes in floodwater surface
elevations, flows, and floodplain boundaries for the 100-year flood under Alternative 2 (Conservancy and DGS
2005). The results of the modeling indicate that the water surface elevation for the 100-year event (7,650 cfs)
under Alternative 2 would generally be the same as or lower than the existing 100-year water surface within the
study area, nor would the flood boundary enlarge or flood hazards increase in the surrounding area. Therefore,
this impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.8-4
(Alt. 2)

Increased Overbank Flooding for Small Streamflow Events. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 2 would
decrease the channel capacity, raise the streambed elevation, and lower the streambank heights to enlarge
the area of overbank flooding for small (760-cfs) streamflow events within the study area by 61 acres. This
effect would reestablish natural connections between the low-flow channel and the floodplain/marsh surface.
This impact would be beneficial.

Implementing Alternative 2 would decrease the Upper Truckee River’s channel capacity, raise the bed elevation,
lower the streambank heights, and increase the length of the channel, thus enlarging the portion of the study area
inundated under the existing 2-year return interval flow (e.g., 760 cfs) (Table 3.8-5). However, the watershed’s
response to climate change could reduce typical streamflows and the magnitude of the peak streamflow expected
frequently (i.e., every couple of years). Implementing Alternative 2 would improve overbanking at specific
streamflow magnitudes, but watershed hydrology shifts caused by climate change might reduce the frequency
with which those flows would occur. The uncertain but possible hydrologic effects of climate change could
partially offset the benefits of Alternative 2. Still, the channel modifications would improve connections between
the low-flow channel and the floodplain and marsh surface, reestablishing natural hydrologic/hydraulic processes,
which would result in a substantial improvement relative to existing conditions. Therefore, this impact would be
beneficial.

Modified Groundwater Levels and Flow Patterns. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 2 would modify the size,
shape, and location of the Upper Truckee River and change the surface connections and subsurface
conditions around the channels and lagoons, which could change groundwater levels and flow patterns. This
effect would partially counteract the historic effects on groundwater levels and flow patterns on the west side of
the study area caused by dredging of the Tahoe Keys waterways. This impact would be beneficial.

Implementing Alternative 2 would involve directly raising channel bed elevations and backfilling existing incised
channels. These actions would be similar to but more extensive than actions that would occur under Alternative 1.
Also like Alternative 1, this alternative would additionally involve modifying the stream channels to increase
overbank flows across the floodplain, but the modification would be more extensive than under Alternative 1.
These actions would not directly counteract the effects on groundwater levels and flow patterns on the west side
of the study area caused by dredging of the Tahoe Keys waterways, which would remain in place. However, the
actions would restore groundwater storage opportunities and flow patterns previously altered by dredging and
straightening of the Upper Truckee River channel and by the river’s geomorphic adjustments to watershed
disturbances (i.e., incision and widening).
Alternative 2 would keep the active Upper Truckee River channel close to the existing alignment, near the
previously dredged waterways of the Tahoe Keys. Implementing this alternative would not worsen the
groundwater loss that occurs toward those artificial channels during low lake stands under existing conditions.
This would result in an improvement relative to existing conditions. This impact would be beneficial.
IMPACT

(Alt. 2)

Exposure to Seismically Generated Wave Hazards. (CEQA 8, TRPA 8) Alternative 2 proposes
improvements within the study area that could be damaged by seismically generated waves that could develop
in Lake Tahoe. The most important hazard would be presented by a tsunami caused by a large local
earthquake, rather than by seiche waves of varied sources. The potential for exposure of people or structures
to the effects of a tsunami would be low. This impact would be less than significant.

Alternative 2 proposes the development of recreational facilities within and at the margins of the Upper Truckee
Marsh. The area is adjacent and graded to Lake Tahoe and is exposed to inundation when large waves develop on
the lake, as described above in Impact 3.8-6 (Alt. 1). The proposed improvements most vulnerable to damage by a
tsunami are the reclaimed Sailing Lagoon and the dune restoration area (and facilities) at Cove East Beach.
Because of the low probability of a tsunami occurring in Lake Tahoe, the relatively low human use of the study
area (i.e., no proposed structures for human occupation), and the reparability of expected damage, this impact
would be less than significant.

IMPACT

(Alt. 3)

Increased Runoff Volumes and Peak Flows. (CEQA 3, 4; TRPA 1, 2) Implementing Alternative 3 would
require construction of impervious surfaces at several discrete and dispersed locations within the study area
for trails, viewpoints, observation areas, fishing access areas, boardwalks, and a kiosk and would
incrementally modify the drainage pattern. As described in Environmental Commitment 11, permanent
stormwater detention features or infiltration systems and other BMPs would be incorporated into the final
design to accommodate all 20-year, 1-hour storm runoff without erosion. This impact would be less than
significant.

This impact would be similar to Impact 3.8-1 (Alt. 1), but of smaller extent and magnitude. Under Alternative 3,
new foot and bike trails, six viewpoints, one observation area, a fishing access area, and a kiosk would create new
impervious areas. However, Alternative 3 would also include activities and features that would decrease the
volume of runoff or peak flows generated within portions of the study area, including restoration of existing trails
and the TKPOA Corporation Yard and its access road.

Changes in land coverage are analyzed in Impact 3.6-3 (Alt. 3) in Section 3.6, “Geology and Soils, Mineral

than the allowable coverage in the study area. For areas outside the litigation parcels coverage relocation would be
completed at a 1:1 ratio and therefore would comply with the TRPA Code.
The features of Alternative 3 could increase the volume of runoff generated within portions of the study area and
could locally redirect or increase peak flows. These runoff changes would occur only in portions of the study area,
but increased flow volumes and peaks could be released off-site (e.g., into the storm drainage system and
ultimately into Lake Tahoe).

IMPACT
3.8-2
(Alt. 3)

Effects on Channels from Reconfiguration of Stream Channels and Lagoon Surface Water Features.
(CEQA 2; TRPA 1, 4) Implementing Alternative 3 would move portions of the Upper Truckee River channel
and reconnect the Sailing Lagoon with the river, which would reconfigure the study area’s drainage patterns to
have both the river and Trout Creek flows in the middle of the marsh. The change to drainage patterns would
reestablish the site’s naturally occurring surface water features and hydrologic/hydraulic processes, and the
project design would incorporate measures to protect the lower reach of Trout Creek from local erosive effects
of increased flow. However, adjustments to the river mouth locations and duration of active flow through the
beach may change the size of the Trout Creek lagoon and/or beach opening. Still, the changes would be within
the range of natural conditions. This impact would be less than significant.

Implementing Alternative 3 would involve directly modifying surface water features in the study area to
counteract and/or compensate for past actions and the degraded existing condition. Alternative 3 would connect
the main channel with the network of small remnant channel sections in the center of the study area through two
direct measures.
First, the approximately 1,910-foot-long eastside channel of the Upper Truckee River channel between RS 17+00
and RS 29+00 would be reestablished as the low-flow channel to create a longer, more sinuous channel. This
would move the low-flow channel as much as 200 feet to the east of its existing location, although the low-flow
channel would still be within the range of location(s) of the historically active low-flow channel(s). Second, a
single-thread pilot channel would be constructed, extending from RS 29+00 about 1,500 feet into the middle of
the study area. This would move the low-flow channel as much as 400 feet to the east of its existing location,
although the pilot channel would still be within the range of location(s) of the historically active low-flow
channel(s).
Alternative 3 would also involve replacing the degraded existing channel and the straightened reach adjacent to
the LWS Wetlands Restoration Project area between RS 28+00 and RS 96+00 with the reoccupied channel(s) in
the middle of the study area. However, the design and construction would not dictate the location of the river’s
low-flow channel(s) through the middle of the marsh, because several existing topographic lows and channel
fragments might be reoccupied by the river over time. Natural processes would determine the eventual location of
the channel(s) downstream of the pilot channel. This could move the low-flow channel as much as 1,700 feet to
the east of its existing location between RS 39 +00 and RS 96+00.
Also, Alternative 3 would involve modifying the previously dredged mouth of the Upper Truckee River by
constructing a hardened grade control at RS 99+00 with a minimum elevation of 6,222.0 feet NGVD and
installing biotechnical measures (e.g., willow stakings) to narrow the channel and to encourage sediment
deposition. This would not relocate the existing river mouth, but would reinforce its existing vertical and lateral

position. The proposed changes to the river mouth under Alternative 3 would not be expected to change drainage
patterns. Alternative 3 (as with Alternatives 1 and 2) would also reestablish the same hydrologic connection
between the Sailing Lagoon and the Upper Truckee River near the river mouth.
The relocations of the river’s low-flow channel sections described above are within the range of historic locations
on-site, but constitute a major change relative to conditions that have existed for more than 90 years.
Reconnecting the Sailing Lagoon to the river would reestablish surface water features and drainage patterns
within the study area that occurred historically and would not adversely affect off-site drainage or the amount of
water in any off-site water bodies. The changes to the drainage pattern in the middle of the marsh, though
confined to locations within the study area, would increase the amount of water in the downstream reaches of
Trout Creek and its lagoon. They also could potentially affect the location or frequency of discharge from Trout
Creek to the lake through the barrier beach. These effects could modify the hydraulics of the Trout Creek lagoon
and flow directions along the local shore, and could indirectly affect beach erosion or beach habitat.
Redirecting the low-flow channel(s) to the middle of the study area under Alternative 3 would increase flows in
the downstream reach of Trout Creek. The relative increase in flows would be largest for low and moderate
events, but increases would occur even during large events. For some flow events, more surface water could be
conveyed to the Trout Creek lagoon and more flow could be directed at the Trout Creek portion of the barrier
beach than under existing conditions. Although this condition would still be within the range of conditions that
may have existed naturally, it would be a major change relative to conditions that have existed for at least 90
years. This would alter the amount of surface water within portions of the study area, although it would not alter
the amount of water discharged from the study area to Lake Tahoe. It could alter the hydraulic forces on the
portion of the beach ridge along the Trout Creek lagoon during moderate flood events.
Alternative 4 would involve constructing channel stabilization on Trout Creek (RS 66+00 to RS 95+00) and a
lateral grade control structure at the existing confluence of Trout Creek and the Upper Truckee River (RS 96+00)
in anticipation of possible increased flows. The design would be vertically stable up to the 100-year peak flows,
assuming combined peaks of Trout Creek and the Upper Truckee River, and the bank stabilization would be
designed to be stable up to the 25-year peak flows.
Therefore, although permanent changes to drainage patterns and surface water features could occur, the long-term
reconfigurations after implementation of Alternative 3 would be within the range of previously occurring natural
patterns. This impact would be less than significant.

Modified 100-Year Flood Flow Directions or Floodplain Boundaries. (CEQA 7; TRPA 3, 8) Implementing
Alternative 3 would decrease the channel capacity, raise the streambed elevation, lower the streambank
heights, and modify flow routes (adding and reconnecting channel length), but would enlarge floodplain storage
because fill would be excavated in some areas within the FEMA regulatory floodway or floodplain. As a net
result, the extent or elevation of the 100-flood hazard area as designated by FEMA would not be adversely
modified. This impact would be less than significant.

Implementing Alternative 3 would decrease the low-flow channel capacity, directly raise the streambed elevation,
and increase the length of the Upper Truckee River channel in the study area through both active and passive
restoration. Under the alternative, about 3,300 feet of new, geomorphically sized channel would be constructed
and 1,500 feet of existing secondary channel would be reshaped, creating new floodplain storage. Also, additional
storage would be added by creating lowered floodplains along segments of the new and existing low-flow channel
and removing fill at the LWS Restoration Area and the TKPOA Corporation Yard. However, backfilling
abandoned channels would decrease storage.
A hydraulic analysis of the study area was conducted to estimate potential changes in floodwater surface
elevations, flows, and floodplain boundaries for the 100-year flood under Alternative 3 Conservancy and DGS
2005. The results of the modeling indicate that the water surface elevation for the 100-year event (7,650 cfs)

under Alternative 3 would be the same as or lower than the existing 100-year water surface at most cross sections.
These changes would not be associated with any expansion of the 100-year flood hazard zone and would not
cause inundation of any existing structures during the 100-year event. Therefore, this impact would be less than
significant.

Increased Overbank Flooding for Small Streamflow Events. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 3 would
decrease the channel capacity, raise the streambed elevation, and lower the streambank heights to enlarge
the area of overbank flooding for small (760-cfs) streamflow events within the study area by 91 acres. This
effect would reestablish natural connections between the low-flow channel and the floodplain/marsh surface.
This impact would be beneficial.

Implementing Alternative 3 would decrease the Upper Truckee River’s channel capacity, increase the length of
the channel, and enlarge the portion of the study area inundated under the existing 2-year return interval flow
(e.g., 760 cfs) (Table 3.8-5). However, the watershed’s response to climate change could reduce typical
streamflows and the magnitude of the peak streamflow expected frequently (i.e., every couple of years).
Implementing Alternative 3 would improve overbanking at specific streamflow magnitudes, but watershed
hydrology shifts caused by climate change might reduce the frequency with which those flows would occur. The
uncertain but possible hydrologic effects of climate change could partially offset the benefits of Alternative 3.
Still, the channel modifications would improve connections between the low-flow channel and the floodplain and
marsh surface, reestablishing natural hydrologic/hydraulic processes, which would result in a substantial
improvement relative to existing conditions. Therefore, this impact would be beneficial.

Modified Groundwater Levels and Flow Patterns. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 3 would modify the size,
shape, and location of the Upper Truckee River and change the surface connections and subsurface
conditions around the channels and lagoons which could change groundwater levels and flow patterns. This
effect would partially counteract the historic effects on groundwater levels and flow patterns on the west side of
the study area caused by dredging of the Tahoe Keys waterways. This impact would be beneficial.

Like Alternative 1, Alternative 3 would involve directly raising channel bed elevations and backfilling existing
incised channels, but these actions would be more extensive than under Alternative 1. Also like Alternative 1, this
alternative would additionally involve modifying the stream channels to increase overbank flows across the
floodplain, but the modification would be more extensive than under Alternative 1. These actions would not
directly counteract the effects on groundwater levels and flow patterns on the west side of the study area caused
by dredging of the Tahoe Keys waterways, which would remain in place. However, the actions would restore
groundwater storage opportunities and flow patterns previously altered by dredging and straightening of the
Upper Truckee River channel and by the river’s geomorphic adjustments to watershed disturbances (i.e., incision
and widening).
Alternative 3 would move the active Upper Truckee River channel to the east from its existing alignment, farther
from the previously dredged waterways of the Tahoe Keys. Construction of the keys channels essentially moved
the natural discharge boundary (i.e., the lake margin) closer to the location of the present Upper Truckee River
channel. Under this alternative, the channel would be moved away from the discharge boundary. Relocating the
channel would increase the separation of the river from the discharge boundary. Theoretically, the increased
separation would lengthen the groundwater flow paths (and reduce the groundwater gradients) between the river
and the Tahoe Keys when the river acts as a recharge boundary (i.e., during periods when the surface flow
elevation in the river is higher than the groundwater table). Under this condition, more of the water recharging
from the river would be retained in the marsh area (or retained longer). Although difficult to quantify, this effect
is expected to promote or prolong seasonal high-groundwater conditions in the marsh. Therefore, expected
changes to groundwater conditions under Alternative 3 would result in an improvement relative to existing
conditions. This impact would be beneficial.

fishing access areas, boardwalks, and a kiosk. As described in Environmental Commitment 11, permanent
stormwater detention features or infiltration systems and other BMPs would be incorporated into the final
design to accommodate all 20-year, 1-hour storm runoff without erosion. This impact would be less than
significant.

This impact would be similar to Impact 3.8-1 (Alt. 1), but of smaller extent and magnitude. Construction of new
trails, viewpoints, observation areas, and a kiosk would require placement of new impervious or partially pervious
surfaces within the study area. The affected areas are generally small relative to the size of the overall study area.
Changes in land coverage are analyzed in Impact 3.6-3 (Alt. 4) in Section 3.6, “Geology and Soils, Mineral
Resources, and Land Capability and Coverage.” As stated in Impact 3.6-3 (Alt. 4), the proposed coverage is less
than the allowable coverage in the study area. For areas outside the litigation parcels coverage relocation would be

The features of Alternative 4 would increase the volume of runoff generated within portions of the study area and
would locally redirect or increase peak flows. These runoff changes would occur only in portions of the study
area, but increased flow volumes and peaks could be released off-site (e.g., into the storm drainage system and
ultimately into Lake Tahoe).
Alternative 4 would also involve restoring about 123,000 square feet of existing informal trails lying on
compacted soils. The soils would be decompacted and native vegetation would be reestablished. This would
increase infiltration and would reduce runoff volumes and peak flows generated along the informal trails.
As described for Alternative 1, EC 11 (Table 2-6) would be implemented. This environmental commitment would
involve installing permanent BMPs, stormwater detention features, or infiltration systems that would convey
runoff, and maintaining them over the life of the project. These measures would reduce the effect of the
incremental increase in runoff that may result from constructing impervious surfaces as part of Alternative 4. This
impact would be less than significant.

Effects on Channels from Reconfiguration of Stream Channels and Lagoon Surface Water Features.

patterns would reestablish naturally occurring surface water features and hydrologic/hydraulic processes on
the portion of the site located along the Upper Truckee River corridor. Therefore, this impact would be
beneficial.

Implementing Alternative 4 would involve directly modifying surface water features in the study area to
counteract and/or compensate for past actions and the degraded existing condition. Alternative 4 would modify
the existing channel’s shape and size and create an active floodplain below the existing terrace along the Upper
Truckee River. Implementing this alternative would cause only minor changes to internal drainage patterns and is
not expected to generate changes in either off-site drainage patterns or the quantity of water in any surface water
feature.
The reconfigured Upper Truckee River low-flow channel and overbanking floodplain would be within the range
of historic locations on-site. The reconfiguration would improve channel stability and reestablish natural
hydrologic/hydraulic processes (i.e., overbanking) on a portion of the site without causing indirect adverse effects.
Therefore, this impact would be beneficial.

Modified 100-Year Flood Flow Directions or Floodplain Boundaries. (CEQA 7; TRPA 3, 8) Implementing
Alternative 4 would not modify the river channel elevation, but would make minor changes to the size and
capacity of the low-flow channel and would increase floodplain storage because an inset floodplain would be
excavated and fill would be removed in some areas within the FEMA regulatory floodway or floodplain. As a
net result, the extent or elevation of the 100-year special flood hazard area as designated by FEMA would not
be adversely modified. This impact would be less than significant.

Implementing Alternative 4 would directly reestablish a narrow but functional floodplain along the single-thread,
degraded existing channel (RS 0+00 to RS 67+00) inset into the surrounding terrace. Local cut and fill would be
used to improve sinuosity and bed diversity in the straightened reach (RS 67+00 to RS 93+00).These proposed
changes have been designed to beneficially increase the frequency and extent of overbanking onto the floodplain
under low to moderate flood events (i.e., the 2-year and 5-year events).
Implementing this alternative would not raise the streambed elevation or increase the channel length of the Upper
Truckee River, but it would decrease the capacity of the river’s active channel in the study area. A hydraulic
analysis of the study area was conducted to estimate potential changes in floodwater surface elevations, flows,
and floodplain boundaries for the 100-year flood under Alternative 4 (Conservancy and DGS 2005). The results
of the modeling indicate that the water surface elevation for the 100-year event (7,650 cfs) under Alternative 4
would be the same as or lower than the existing 100-year water surface at all cross sections. The results reflect the
increased floodplain storage formed by creation of inset floodplains and other excavation proposed by the
alternative. These changes would not produce any expansion of the 100-year flood hazard zone and would not
cause any existing structures to be inundated during the 100-year event. Therefore, this impact would be less than
significant.

(Alt. 4)

Increased Overbank Flooding for Small Streamflow Events. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 4 would
decrease the channel capacity and lower the streambank heights to enlarge the area of overbank flooding for
small (760-cfs) streamflow events within the study area by about 17 acres. This effect would reestablish natural
connections between the low-flow channel and an active floodplain surface. Therefore, this impact would be
beneficial.

Implementing Alternative 4 would decrease the Upper Truckee River’s channel capacity and enlarge the portion
of the study area inundated under the existing 2-year return interval flow (e.g., 760 cfs) (Table 3.8-5). However,
the watershed’s response to climate change could reduce typical streamflows and reduce the magnitude of the
peak streamflow expected frequently (i.e., every couple of years). Implementing Alternative 4 would improve
overbanking at specific streamflow magnitudes, but watershed hydrology shifts caused by climate change might
reduce the frequency with which those flows would occur. The uncertain but possible hydrologic effects of
climate change could partially offset the benefits of Alternative 4. Still, the channel modifications would
reestablish natural hydrologic/hydraulic processes along the existing Upper Truckee River alignment, which
would still result in an improvement relative to existing conditions. Therefore, this impact would be beneficial.
IMPACT
3.8-5
(Alt. 4)

Modified Groundwater Levels and Flow Patterns. (CEQA 1; TRPA 5, 6) Implementing Alternative 4 would
not modify the size, shape, and location of the Upper Truckee River or change the surface connections and
subsurface conditions around the channels and lagoons. However, this alternative would involve excavating an
inset floodplain, which would result in minor and localized changes to groundwater levels and flow patterns.
This impact would be less than significant.

Alternative 4 would not involve raising the streambed elevation but would involve excavating a widened inset
floodplain throughout the study area. The length and elevation of the boundary between the groundwater level in
the unconfined aquifer and the surface water would not increase or decrease substantially. Therefore, a substantial
change to the channel’s function as a seasonal groundwater discharge or recharge boundary would be unlikely.
Although Alternative 4 would not lower groundwater levels beneath the stream, it would not raise the streambed
and groundwater, nor would it improve groundwater connectivity across the site (as under Alternatives 1, 2, and
3). The enlarged inset floodplain could move groundwater flow paths and the locations where groundwater might
discharge to surface water.
Removing marsh sediments to create the inset floodplain would also reduce the available groundwater storage in
the marsh, but only during periods of high groundwater levels. During such periods, the intersection of the
groundwater table with the active floodplain would move outward from the channel and groundwater may
discharge onto the surface of the inset floodplain, rather than directly into the channel. This condition would be
transitory; the groundwater boundary would eventually fluctuate as groundwater levels and streamflow elevations
change. Minor amounts of groundwater on the inset floodplain’s surface may evaporate. This effect would be
similar to the result of channel widening in response to past disturbance that may occur both under existing
conditions and under future conditions with the No-Project/No-Action Alternative. Construction of Alternative 4
would mimic a possible future geomorphic state with an active floodplain inset within a widened stream corridor.
This would result in groundwater levels and flow paths that are similar to those expected under the No­
Project/No-Action Alternative, which could be worse than the existing condition.
Alternative 4 could result in future modifications of groundwater levels and patterns of flow in the study area, but
the potential changes would be similar to those that would occur under existing conditions and the No-Project/NoAction Alternative. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.8-6
(Alt. 4)

Exposure to Seismically Generated Wave Hazards. (CEQA 8, TRPA 8) Alternative 4 proposes
improvements within the study area that could be damaged by seismically generated waves that could develop
in Lake Tahoe. The most important hazard would be presented by a tsunami caused by a large local
earthquake, rather than by seiche waves of varied sources. The potential for exposure of people or structures
to the effects of a tsunami would be low. This impact would be less than significant.

Alternative 4 proposes the development of recreational facilities at the margins of the Upper Truckee Marsh. The
area is adjacent and graded to Lake Tahoe and is exposed to inundation when large waves develop on the lake, as
described above in Impact 3.8-6 (Alt. 1). The proposed improvements potentially vulnerable to damage by the

largest of estimated tsunamis are trails, viewing areas, and the self-service visitors center restoration (and
facilities) at Cove East Beach. Because of the low probability of a tsunami occurring in Lake Tahoe, the relatively
low human use of the study area (i.e., no proposed structures for human occupation), and the reparability of
expected damage to any proposed structures, this impact would be less than significant.
Alternative 5: No-Project/No-Action
No-Project/No-Action Future Effects of Climate Change
Analysis of the potential impacts of the No-Project/No-Action Alternative considers the potential environmental
effects that may occur within the study area should none of the action alternatives (Alternative 1, 2, 3, or 4) be
implemented. The analysis assumes that no purposeful (i.e., built) changes to the channel of the Upper Truckee
River or Trout Creek or to other hydrologic resources would occur in the study area. Although no human-made
changes would be expected, the effects of global climate change may substantially affect the hydrology of the
area. Recent research has documented expected substantial changes in California’s climate, including changes
within the northern Sierra Nevada and the Tahoe Basin (Moser et al. 2009). Climate change could affect
hydrology and flood conditions in the study area.
The project is intended to function as a relatively self-sustaining system that is subject to the unregulated
streamflows of the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek. The designs of the project alternatives have been
guided by historic data sets and by current field conditions that reflect historic geomorphic adjustments to natural
factors and human disturbance. However, the project’s life span is long (more than 25 years), which increases the
likelihood that the effects of global climate change could alter hydrologic conditions over the life of the project.
Therefore, public review of and agency decisions about the project alternatives would benefit from an analysis of
whether (and to what extent) climate change is expected to affect the project’s performance, benefits, or adverse
impacts. No formal federal, state, or TRPA policies currently require or specify an approach to such an analysis,
but climate change effects need to be considered.
Current long-term planning efforts for the Tahoe Basin are considering the potential effects of climate change
either via sensitivity analyses or in approaches to adaptive management, or both. Furthermore, the increase in
reported climate change effects by various media and widening application of climate change considerations in
resource management decisions indicate that laypersons, regulators, and managers alike will seek information
about the effects of climate change on the project’s outcome.
Data resources regarding the causes and consequences of global climate change are abundant; these resources
range widely in their geographic scope and applicability to the analysis of the project. This analysis focuses on the
anticipated consequences of climate change on physical environmental conditions in the next 50 years in the
western United States, and more specifically, in the mountainous areas of California. In the last decade or so, a
few studies have looked at potential climate change effects on surface-water and groundwater hydrology, water
resource issues, or forest response for the Sierra Nevada or the Lake Tahoe region, or both (Jeton et al. 1996;
Knowles and Cayan 2007). These evaluations provide information about possible changes in water inputs to the
project’s study area (e.g., earlier seasonal snowmelt, increased winter precipitation from snow to rain, and
increased streamflow).
Effects of climate change documented by these recent studies include increasing average water temperatures in
Lake Tahoe and increased thermal stability and resistance to mixing within the lake (Coats et al. 2006; TERC
2009). Some studies have focused on the response of Lake Tahoe to climate change (e.g., Coats et al. 2006), but
have not commented directly on expected changes in tributary rivers. However, regional studies for the Sierra
Nevada suggest that under expected climate change, higher snowlines will probably increase the frequency and
magnitude of flooding and floods (as larger portions of mountain watersheds may be exposed to rainfall rather
than snow) (Dettinger et al. 2009).

The most useful data specific to the Lake Tahoe region are those compiled and generated by Tetra Tech (2007).
Using regional (within California) projections of climate change (Dettinger 2004; Cayan et al. 2006), Tetra Tech
(2007) explored the effects of climate change on the overall hydrologic response of the watershed in relation to
the total maximum daily load watershed model of pollutant loadings to Lake Tahoe. The studies used somewhat
different modeling, downscaling, and meta-analysis approaches, but for the Tahoe Basin, they had close
agreement on modeled, representative changes. Further, Dettinger (2004) provided predictions for time intervals
of interest (ca. 2050).
The central estimate for temperature and precipitation changes from the Cayan et al. (2006) paper and the
Dettinger (2004) paper formed the basis of Tetra Tech’s Central Projection model scenario: warming of 2 degrees
Celsius (°C) and a ten percent decrease in total precipitation by midcentury. Additional modeling scenarios were
formulated by Tetra Tech (2007), using temperature increases of one standard deviation on either side of that
central estimate (1°C and 3°C increases above current temperatures) and precipitation changes of one standard
deviation above and below the central estimate (-25 percent and +15 percent of today’s total precipitation, as well
as a no change from today’s precipitation).
Tetra Tech simulated baseline (existing) and the various climate change scenarios for a 15-year model evaluation
period (1990 through 2004) by applying the percent changes in temperature and precipitation uniformly to the
historic weather data sets. Simulations with the spatially discrete and temporally detailed Tetra Tech model (with
184 subwatersheds, 20 land uses, and hourly time steps for the 15-year period) provide information about the
range of conditions that could occur throughout Lake Tahoe watersheds in terms of total precipitation, air
temperature and snowpack, and water yield from snow, as well as total outflow to streams (surface runoff and
base flow). An analysis of annualized daily snowpack from the model results is also provided by Tetra Tech
(2007), which indicates the range of likely changes in snowpack depth, snow accumulation/melt season, and
timing shifts.
The following analysis of the potential impacts of the No-Project/No-Action Alternative considers the potential
for the hydrologic conditions in the study area to adjust in response to possible climatic changes.
IMPACT
3.8-1
(Alt. 5)

Increased Runoff Volumes and Peak Flows. (CEQA 3, 4; TRPA 1, 2) Implementing Alternative 5 would not
increase impervious surfaces within the study area. Therefore, no impact would occur.

Existing adverse conditions related to runoff volumes and peak-flow magnitudes could worsen under the No­
Project/No-Action Alternative. Alternative 5 would not directly modify runoff volumes or peak flows generated
on the site. In the absence of other future actions, runoff characteristics under the No-Project/No-Action
Alternative, in the absence of other future actions, would largely be controlled by climate change influences on
hydrology and the associated vegetation responses and interactions. The effects of climate change would modify
runoff volumes and peak flow, but there is uncertainty about the change in precipitation that, in combination with
various temperature projections, could produce a range of runoff responses. The climate change analysis
conducted by Tetra Tech (2007) indicates that mean runoff flows would increase in fall and winter but would
decrease in spring and summer. In most climate change scenarios, mean flows and total annual runoff are similar
to or less than existing flows and runoff; however, peak flows, from rainstorms and rain-on-snow events, could be
similar to or worse than existing peak flows. Implementing the No-Project/No-Action Alternative would not
modify the historical increase of impervious surfaces, degraded soil and vegetation cover properties, and their
runoff generation and peak-flow conditions.
The above features of Alternative 5 would not measurably change the volume of runoff generated within the study
area, nor would they redirect or increase peak flows. Flow volumes and peaks released off-site (e.g., to the storm
drainage system and the lake) would not be expected to increase. Therefore, no adverse impacts on runoff

volumes and peak flows in the study area would result and no off-site effects would occur. No impact would
occur.
IMPACT
3.8-2
(Alt. 5)

Effects on Channels from Reconfiguration of Stream Channels and Lagoon Surface Water Features.
(CEQA 2; TRPA 1, 4) Implementing Alternative 5 would not directly modify the low-flow channel or lagoon
areas in the study area. Therefore, no impact would occur.

Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek channels in the study area
would undergo changes as they continue to respond to past disturbances. The progressive geomorphic adjustment
along the Upper Truckee River would likely be primarily in the form of streambank erosion and widening. The
trend of streambed erosion in the lower reach of Trout Creek also is expected to progress. Channel instability
would decrease over time and sediment yields from channel erosion would decrease. Stabilized sediment deposits
or inset floodplains would be expected to form along the widened stream corridor of the Upper Truckee River, at
least upstream of Lake Tahoe’s backwater effect. However, these natural geomorphic adjustments would not
reconnect the incised channels to the historic floodplain, maintain or increase overbank flows onto the floodplain,
raise or maintain groundwater levels, or otherwise restore the degraded ecosystem functions of the stream
channels.
Future channel processes and conditions under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative are generally expected to
follow a predictable trend based on geomorphic channel-evolution models. However, such processes and
conditions could be altered by the effects of climate change, which would likely exacerbate some of the existing
degraded condition and function of the surface water features. Increased rainfall as a proportion of total
precipitation, increased runoff during winter, decreased snow-water equivalent, and decreased spring/summer
runoff are all likely to limit the rate of natural recovery within the incised channel systems, further reduce
overbank flows, and lower groundwater levels that can support floodplain wetlands.
No proposed actions or natural processes occurring under Alternative 5 would provide “recovery” from the past
direct disturbances within the study area, such as dredging and filling of surface water bodies. For example, the
fill that separates the Sailing Lagoon from the Upper Truckee River would likely remain and the historical
maintenance of the navigation channels would continue. Surface water in the Tahoe Keys Marina and Tahoe Keys
channels would continue to circulate with the water in the Sailing Lagoon, and both would remain directly
connected to Lake Tahoe via the East Channel. The physical features would be similar to existing features, but
their hydrology would be altered by climate change, potentially exacerbating existing flow and water quality
problems in the constructed channels.
Uncertainty exists about whether total precipitation is more likely to decrease or to increase as a result of climate
change; however, the net effect of changes in precipitation and average temperature, with continued year-to-year
and decadal variation (e.g., flood and drought cycles), may reduce total runoff to Lake Tahoe. Should this
reduction occur, the proportion of time when the lake is below historic median elevations may increase.
Correspondingly, lower water levels in the Sailing Lagoon and connected Tahoe Keys navigation channels would
result, thus worsening circulation, temperature, and related water quality problems in those water bodies.
Implementing Alternative 5 would not directly change the location or size of the channels, lagoons, or other
topographic features that would affect drainage within the study area. Therefore, no impact would occur.
IMPACT
3.8-3
(Alt. 5)

Modified 100-Year Flood Flow Directions or Floodplain Boundaries. (CEQA 7; TRPA 3, 8) Implementing
Alternative 5 would not directly modify the existing channel, floodplain, fill materials, the lagoon configuration,
or the river mouth. No direct or indirect modifications to the 100-year flow directions or floodplain boundaries
would be expected, and the existing flood hazards would remain. This impact would be less than significant.

Several past actions along the Upper Truckee River corridor have modified the 100-year floodplain boundaries,
storage capacity, and/or flow directions: placement of fill for road crossings and other transportation facilities
(e.g., U.S. 50 road fills, City of South Lake Tahoe Airport); placement of fill and/or structures for residential,
commercial, or other uses (e.g., Tahoe Island area, Elks Club, Grocery Outlet, Carrows); and/or removal of
floodplain area by levee protection for residential, commercial, or other uses (e.g., Tahoe Keys). Most of these
actions occurred several decades ago, before floodplain management regulations took effect. However, the result
of historic actions has been to degrade both the storage capacity of the 100-year floodplain and the flow routes in
the study area and upstream along the Upper Truckee River relative to natural conditions. Floodplain capacity and
flow routes in specific reaches affect those in adjacent reaches, and for the 100-year event these effects have
influences in both upstream and downstream directions.
Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, the topography and physical characteristics of the existing
floodplain and channel in the study area would not be modified directly. Continued geomorphic adjustments to
past disturbance might enlarge the incised channel along various reaches of the Upper Truckee River, but not
increase total floodplain capacity for the 100-year flood. Therefore, the degraded existing capacity of the 100-year
floodplain and flow routes would remain.
Implementing Alternative 5 would not directly modify the existing channel, floodplain, or fill materials, or the
configuration of the Sailing Lagoon. The alternative would not raise the streambed elevation, increase the channel
length, or decrease the channel capacity of the Upper Truckee River channel within the study area. Unlike the
other alternatives, under Alternative 5 the floodplain would not be enlarged by direct removal of fill, excavation
of inset floodplain features, or reconnection of lagoons in the study area to the active floodplain. Alternative 5
would not modify the river mouth’s location, elevation, or capacity.
Therefore, the 100-year flow directions and floodplain boundaries would not be directly modified under
Alternative 5. The 100-year water surface profile would remain as simulated for existing conditions (Exhibit
3.8-15). Land uses along the margins of the study area would remain subject to existing flood hazards. In response
to global climate change, future watershed hydrology may increase the 100-year return interval peak streamflow
to a magnitude greater than the existing value (7,650 cfs) that has been calculated from the recorded conditions
over the last several decades. This impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.8-4
(Alt. 5)

Increased Overbank Flooding for Small Streamflow Events. (CEQA 3, TRPA 1) Implementing Alternative 5
would not change channel capacity, streambed elevation and streambank heights, or the area of overbank
flooding for small to moderate streamflow events within the study area. The existing degraded conditions would
persist. This impact would be less than significant.

Past actions enlarged the capacity of stream channels in the study area and upstream on the Upper Truckee River
and Trout Creek. The existing stream channels are now oversized both because direct actions have occurred (e.g.,
straightening, dredging, or adding levees) and because the channels have responded indirectly to watershed
hydrology and/or the direct disturbances (e.g., through streambed and streambank erosion).
The enlarged channel capacities reduce opportunities for normal overbank flows (flows onto the floodplain)
during frequent, small-magnitude streamflow events. Under natural conditions, overbank flows are typically
expected on functioning streams every couple of years, lasting for a few days up to a couple of weeks. However,
under existing conditions in the study area and along long sections of the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek
(except where previous restoration projects have been implemented), the channels are so large that flows only
reach the top of bank every five–ten years. Given the channels’ present conditions and capacities, overbank
flooding does not happen in the study area during frequent, small streamflow events (i.e., streamflows of 760 cfs
recurring every two years). Limited overbanking in particular reaches can reduce floodplain connectivity in
adjacent downstream reaches, but does not have substantial effects in the upstream direction.

This degraded condition negatively affects channel stability. The reduced stability, in turn, increases sediment
pollutant sources (i.e., sediment produced by erosion). It also negatively limits overbank processes and
groundwater support for sediment and nutrient storage that would occur on a functioning active floodplain.
Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek channels in the study area
would undergo continued progressive geomorphic adjustments in response to past disturbances. The primary
adjustments would be streambank erosion and widening along the river and streambed erosion in the creek’s
lower reach. These changes would further enlarge the channels, thus worsening the existing degraded condition
relative to overbanking.
Future channel processes and conditions are generally expected to follow a predictable trend based on geomorphic
channel-evolution models. Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, the potential for frequent overbanking at
a given streamflow magnitude (e.g., 760 cfs, the existing 2-year return interval flow) would be similar to the
existing potential. However, channel processes and conditions could be altered by the effects of climate change.
Precipitation changes, reductions in the percentage of precipitation falling as snow, and temperature increases
caused by climate change would likely reduce mean streamflows, average annual runoff, and the magnitude of
peak streamflow expected frequently (every two–five years). Therefore, climate change could exacerbate the
existing degraded condition by further reducing the frequency with which the existing design overbank flow (760
cfs) would occur in the study area.
In addition, the watershed’s response to climate change could reduce typical streamflows and the frequency with
which the proposed design overbank flow (760 cfs) would occur in the study area. Therefore, under the No­
Project/No-Action Alternative, the opportunity for frequent overbanking in the study area and along upstream
reaches could be further degraded beyond the existing condition.
However, implementing Alternative 5 would not result in any actions that would change existing conditions relative
to the potential for or frequency of overbanking events. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.8-5
(Alt. 5)

Modified Groundwater Levels and Flow Patterns. (CEQA 1; TRPA 5, 6) Implementing Alternative 5 would not
modify the size, shape, and location of the Upper Truckee River or change the surface connections and
subsurface conditions around the channels and lagoons. The existing degraded condition would persist. This
impact would be less than significant.

Groundwater levels and flow patterns upstream along the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek have been altered
historically by watershed-scale hydrologic changes, stream channel incision, and extraction of groundwater for water
supply. These actions generally lowered groundwater levels as stream channels progressively incised. In areas of
groundwater pumping, the actions modified groundwater flow rates, even reversing flows in areas with excessive
extraction.
Groundwater conditions in the study area also have been affected by dredging of the Tahoe Keys waterways and the
most downstream reach of the Upper Truckee River. Dredging and construction of the waterways at Tahoe Keys
essentially moved the surface water/groundwater contact zone inland from the natural shoreline. As a result,
groundwater rises along the west margin of the study area when the lake level is high, but is depleted rapidly when
the lake level is low. This response may also indicate that the excavated channels have intercepted zones of
relatively high hydraulic conductivity (e.g., Upper Truckee River channel deposits).
Along the incised stream channels throughout the watershed or dredged waterways near Lake Tahoe, groundwater
flow paths may be interrupted when the surface water levels are low, and more groundwater is released to the
surface water body than under natural conditions. The resulting lowered groundwater levels would reduce the total
volume of groundwater storage and the rate and volume of groundwater discharge to the channel. Groundwater
discharge helps to moderate variations in surface water flow, particularly during periods of reduced streamflow.

California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

These conditions also would impair ecosystem values because lowered groundwater levels would reduce the amount
of groundwater available near the surface to support high soil moisture in meadows and marshes.
Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek channels in the study area
would continue to change as they respond to past disturbances. These natural geomorphic adjustments would not
reverse or improve the degraded groundwater conditions, however. Groundwater levels could decline further in
locations where future channel incision or channel widening is likely to occur as part of natural geomorphic
evolution.
The effects of climate change would likely exacerbate some of the existing degraded condition and function of the
groundwater levels and patterns. Increased seasonality of runoff, reduced snowpack, and possibly decreased total
runoff would likely reduce groundwater recharge within the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek watersheds. This
reduction would cause groundwater volumes and flows to decrease throughout the Upper Truckee River and Trout
Creek systems. If decreases in total runoff to Lake Tahoe were to increase the proportion of time that the lake is
below historic median elevations, then surface water levels in the lake, the Sailing Lagoon, and the connected Tahoe
Keys navigation channels would also be lowered. This could increase the rate of groundwater flow and total
groundwater discharge along the north and west margins of the study area, further reducing groundwater support for
the meadow and marsh.
Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, groundwater levels or flows in the study area would remain degraded
relative to natural conditions. The geomorphic response to past actions would continue and locally worsen existing
groundwater conditions as channels continue to incise and/or widen. Climate change may exacerbate existing
degraded conditions. Therefore, under Alternative 5, the degraded existing groundwater levels and flow patterns
would persist and possibly worsen as geomorphic response continues. This impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.8-6
(Alt. 5)

Exposure to Seismically Generated Wave Hazards. (CEQA 8, TRPA 8) Implementing Alternative 5 would not
result in construction of any improvements within the study area that could be damaged by seismically generated
waves that could develop in Lake Tahoe. The effects of large waves would not change risks to people or
structures relative to existing conditions. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

The flat to gently northward-sloping topography of the study area presents the hazard of inundation during the
development of large waves on Lake Tahoe. Potential tsunamis or large seiches (see Impact 3.8-6 [Alt. 1]) may
inundate much of the study area. No new improvements would be constructed under the No-Project/No-Action
Alternative. Therefore, the risk of damage to improvements posed by inundation by large waves would not change
relative to existing conditions. However, the study area currently includes informal trail networks used by the public
for recreation, as well as minor improvements that include fencing. Possible damage or injury from tsunamis would
be continuing hazards. This impact would be less than significant.

GEOMORPHOLOGY AND WATER QUALITY

This section presents the regulatory setting for geomorphology and water quality, describes the existing
conditions in the study area related to geomorphology and water quality, and evaluates potentially adverse
environmental impacts related to erosion, sedimentation, and deposition associated with project implementation.
The analysis of geomorphology and water quality is based on information obtained through review of academic
research and available information published by federal, state, and local agencies, primarily the Final Report:
Upper Truckee River Upper Reach Environmental Assessment (SH&G 2004a), the Amendment Report: Upper
Truckee River Upper Reach Reclamation Project (SH&G 2004b), and the Riparian Ecosystem Restoration
Feasibility Report associated with the Upper Truckee River Restoration Project (River Run Consulting 2006). The
examination of geomorphology is also based on the preliminary engineering schematic designs prepared for the
alternatives. For a discussion of other water resource issues, refer to Section 3.8, “Hydrology and Flooding.”
Cumulative geomorphology and water quality impacts are addressed in Section 3.18, “Cumulative Impacts.”

3.9.1

AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

REGULATORY SETTING
Federal
The following federal laws and regulations related to geomorphology and water quality are relevant to the
proposed alternatives and described in detail in Chapter 5, “Compliance, Consultation, and Coordination”:
►

Clean Water Act (CWA)
• Section 401
• Section 402
• Section 404

►

Safe Drinking Water Act

State
The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (California Water Code Section 13000 et seq.) requires
establishment of water quality objectives and standards to protect water quality for beneficial uses. This act is
implemented by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) and nine regional water quality control
boards (RWQCBs), which are responsible for preserving California’s water quality. The SWRCB protects water
quality by setting statewide policy, coordinating and supporting RWQCB efforts, and reviewing petitions that
contest RWQCB actions. The RWQCBs issue waste discharge permits, take enforcement action against violators,
and monitor water quality for the protection of waters in their specified regions. The SWRCB and the RWQCBs
jointly administer federal and state laws related to water quality in coordination with the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).
The study area is under the jurisdiction of the Lahontan RWQCB. The Lahontan RWQCB administers CWA
Section 401 water quality certifications in conjunction with USACE’s CWA Section 404 permit. In addition, the
Lahontan RWQCB regulates discharge of stormwater from construction projects (as well as municipal and
industrial stormwater) under the CWA Section 402 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit program. Because the project would disturb more than one acre of land, the Conservancy would need to
obtain and comply with the Lahontan RWQCB’s NPDES General Permit Number CAG616002 for discharge of
stormwater runoff associated with construction activity. The SWRCB adopted a new statewide NPDES
Construction General Permit Order 2009-0009-DWQ on September 2, 2009, that became effective July 1, 2010
(SWRCB 2010). This General Permit imposes more minimum best management practices (BMPs) and establishes

subject to narrative effluent limitations. Risk Level 2 dischargers are subject to technology-based numeric action
levels (NALs) for pH and turbidity. Risk Level 3 dischargers are subject to NALs and numeric effluent limitations
(NELs). Certain sites must develop and implement a storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) and rain
event action plan and all projects must perform effluent monitoring and reporting, along with receiving water
monitoring and reporting for some Risk level 3 sites. Key personnel (e.g., SWPPP preparers, inspectors) must
have certifications to ensure that they are qualified to design and evaluate project specifications that will meet the
requirements. For projects commencing on or after July 1, 2010, the applicant must electronically submit several
permit registration documents before commencement of construction activities: the notice of intent, risk
assessment, postconstruction calculations, a site map, the SWPPP, a signed certification statement by the legally
responsible person, and the first annual fee. The Lahontan RWQCB is responsible for enforcing the new statewide
General Permit in its region and is updating its regional General Permit for construction stormwater discharges
within the Lake Tahoe Hydrologic Unit (HU) to be as least as stringent as the statewide permit (Amorfini, pers.
comm., 2010).
The Water Quality Control Plan for the Lahontan Region (Basin Plan), adopted March 31, 1995, and as amended,
identifies the beneficial uses, water quality objectives, numerical standards, and waste discharge prohibitions for
surface water and groundwater in the California portion of the Tahoe Basin (Lahontan RWQCB 1995:1-1).
Table 3.9-1 summarizes the applicable environmental issues related to this project that are covered under the
Basin Plan. BMPs are defined as “[m]ethods, measures or practices selected by an agency to meet its non-point
source control needs. BMPs include, but are not limited to, structural and nonstructural controls and operation and
maintenance procedures. BMPs can be applied before, during, and after pollution-producing activities to reduce or
eliminate the introduction of pollutants into receiving waters” (Lahontan RWQCB 1995:5.3-1). Stream
Environment Zones (SEZs) are wetland and riparian areas designated by TRPA and the Lahontan RWQCB
through specific criteria using designated water, soil, and vegetation indicators (Lahontan RWQCB 1995:5.7-2).
The Basin Plan incorporates water quality thresholds, programs, and regulations as developed and implemented
by TRPA along with federal and state regulations. The project would be required to meet the provisions of the
Basin Plan for the protection and enhancement of Lake Tahoe.
The Basin Plan lists water quality objectives for all surface waters of the region, including the Lake Tahoe HU, in
addition to specific water quality objectives for certain water bodies in the Lake Tahoe HU (i.e., the entire
watershed tributary to and containing Lake Tahoe), including the Upper Truckee River. The regionwide and water
body–specific objectives pertaining to the Upper Truckee River, groundwater, and stormwater are summarized in
Table 3.9-2. To achieve those objectives, the Basin Plan prohibits discharges and threatened discharges in 100­
year floodplains. These prohibitions are described in Chapter 5 of the Basin Plan and those relevant to project
implementation are summarized below in Table 3.9-3.
Tahoe Regional Planning Agency
Goals and Policies
The TRPA Regional Plan’s Goals and Policies document presents specific goals and policies for achieving and
maintaining adopted environmental thresholds. These goals and policies are implemented through the TRPA
Code of Ordinances (TRPA Code), described below (TRPA 1986:I-1). A key component of the Goals and
Policies document is the Land Use Element, which identifies the fundamental philosophies directing land use and
development in the Tahoe Basin. The Land Use Element consists of seven subelements, including the Water
Quality Sub Element. This subelement identifies two goals and 18 policies designed to support attainment of the
water quality thresholds:

Summary of Basin Plan Water Quality Control Measures Relevant to the Project
Water Quality
Control Measure

Description

Water quality
standards

State standards, including designated beneficial uses and water quality objectives, implemented by the
SWRCB and RWQCBs. Regional “environmental threshold” standards implemented by TRPA.

Waste discharge
prohibitions

State prohibitions against discharge of sewage, industrial waste, solid wastes, earthen materials, and so
on, including prohibitions related to new subdivisions, land capability, SEZs, development not offset by
remedial measures, and new piers in significant fish spawning habitat, implemented by the Lahontan
RWQCB. TRPA implements similar land-use restrictions.

Best management
practices

Use of mandatory BMPs for all new development. Implementation through state and TRPA permits and
enforcement programs. Retrofit of BMPs required by the Lahontan RWQCB for existing development.
BMPs also required for resource management uses, such as timber harvest and livestock grazing. The
Basin Plan endorses the TRPA BMP Handbook.

Controls for SEZs Development and disturbance strictly limited in SEZs and setback areas, 100-year floodplains, and
and similar
shorezone areas. Limited implementation through Lahontan RWQCB discharge prohibitions, TRPA
resources
land-use restrictions, and CWA Section 401 and 404 programs. Some exceptions for public projects and
coverage relocation; specific exemption findings required. Restoration requirement of 1.5:1 for
permitted SEZ disturbance, unless meets specific criteria, such as if the relocation is from one portion
of a SEZ to another portion, there is a net environmental benefit to the SEZ. Shorezone projects must
meet TRPA development standards. TRPA 208 Plan includes SEZ restoration program, which is
expected to restore 25% of disturbed/developed SEZs. Control measures for other problems also serve
to protect groundwater.
Water rights and
water use

Limits on diversions for consumptive use from all sources in the Tahoe Basin by act of Congress.
Waste discharge requirements for sewer districts include conditions to prevent use beyond limits.
TRPA plans include minimum fireflow requirements, as well as requirements for use of native/adapted
plants in landscaping. Recommendations or SWRCB action on water rights policy update and water
meter use.

Outdoor
recreation

Controls for water quality impacts of outdoor recreation (dispersed recreation, campgrounds and dayuse areas, ski areas, golf courses, and boating and shorezone recreation) through Lahontan RWQCB
and TRPA permits and USFS programs on national forest lands. Impact examples: erosion, SEZ
disturbance, fertilizer use, dredging and underwater construction, wastewater disposal, and fuel spills.

Miscellaneous
water quality
problems

Control measures for problems related to fertilizer use, pesticide use, and wet and dry atmospheric
deposition. Fertilizer and pesticide controls through Lahontan RWQCB and TRPA permits;
atmospheric deposition control through TRPA traffic/air pollution controls and other 208 Plan
commitments.

Before the TRPA Code was established, TRPA prepared Volume 1 of the regional water quality management plan
required under Section 208 of the CWA (208 Plan), along with other environmental values and standards, to
identify important issues relating to water quality in the Tahoe Region (TRPA 1981:1-4). The Lahontan RWQCB
subsequently incorporated appropriate provisions of the 208 Plan into the Basin Plan. The 208 Plan has the same
two major water quality goals as the TRPA Regional Plan. The first goal, with eight policies to support its
implementation, is to reduce loading of sediment and nutrients to Lake Tahoe and meet sediment and nutrient
objectives for tributary streams, surface runoff, and subsurface runoff. The second goal, with ten policies to
support its implementation, is to reduce or eliminate the addition of other pollutants that affect water quality in the
Tahoe Basin.
Code of Ordinances
The TRPA Code is a compilation of all the ordinances needed to implement the Goals and Policies. The following
portions of the TRPA Code are most relevant to the geomorphology and water quality aspects of the project:
►

Basic standards and prohibitions for all discharges to surface waters and groundwater are specified in TRPA
Code Section 60.1, “Water Quality Control.” Table 3.9-4 describes the discharge limits to surface runoff and
to groundwater discharges in the Tahoe Basin.

►

Measures to avoid or reduce potential short- and long-term erosion and sedimentation impacts on the quality
of surface water, groundwater, or both are required by TRPA Code Section 33.3, “Grading Standards”;
Section 33.6, “Vegetation Protection during Construction”; and Section 61.4, “Revegetation.”

►

Measures to prevent contamination of sources of drinking water and protect the public health relating to
drinking water are required by TRPA Code Section 60.3, “Source Water Protection.” This measure may apply
to the project since a few domestic wells are located immediately north of the study area and the confluence
of the Upper Truckee River and Angora Creek. The public well south of the study area close to U.S. Highway
50 (U.S. 50) in Meyers is believed to be located far enough from the study area to avoid any potential impact.

►

A section of the TRPA Code in Chapter 30, “Land Coverage,” that indirectly relates to water quality, given
the ability of SEZ to buffer waterways and provide infiltration and uptake opportunities, also relates to the
project. Land coverage standards, limitations, and prohibitions of additional land coverage in TRPA Code
Chapter 30 would apply.

Plan Area Statements
Each plan area statement (PAS) outlines land use classifications, special policies, planning considerations,
permissible uses, and maximum allowances for a portion of the Lake Tahoe Basin. The study area is located
within three PASs: PAS 099 (Al Tahoe), PAS 100 (Truckee Marsh), and PAS 102 (Tahoe Keys).
Runoff control and SEZ restoration are allowed permissible uses under resource management in PAS 009 and
102, but must be considered under a special use provision in PAS 100.
PAS 099 special considerations include a statement that projects need to address the drainage problems in the Al
Tahoe Area, including the problem of stagnant water at Los Angeles and Freel Peak Streets. The study area
receives water from the Al Tahoe Area, and could be affected by drainage projects in that area, but due to its
location the project would only receive runoff and would not directly modify drainage within the Al Tahoe Area.
As considerations for project planning, PAS 100 identifies the commercial and residential uses infringing upon
the SEZ (consisting of the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek corridors, and adjacent marshlands) and the
U.S. 50 crossings’ restriction on natural function of the SEZ. PAS 100 also designates special planning
considerations and policies regarding water quality that relate to the study area:
►
►
►
►

Stream zones should be restored where U.S. 50 crosses the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek.
SEZ should be restored in the vicinity of the crossings of Trout Creek at U.S. 50 and at Black Bart Road.
New roadway alignments through SEZ are to be discouraged.
Banks along both Trout Creek and the Upper Truckee River should be stabilized.

PAS 100 includes a special planning consideration and two special policies regarding geomorphology. The
special planning consideration is the localized problem of bank slumping and erosion along the Upper Truckee
River. The two special policies are:

Banks along both the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek should be stabilized.
Instream habitat should be improved through artificial creation of deep pools and the removal of obstructions.

City of South Lake Tahoe
The study area is located entirely within the jurisdiction of the City of South Lake Tahoe (CSLT). CSLT
ordinances in Chapter 8, “Building Regulations,” require projects to prepare a grading plan for review and
approval of a grading permit by the city building official. The grading plan must include the present contours of
the land, the proposed final grade and location of improvements. CSLT review is intended to safeguard adjoining
properties and public streets and ways from damage by unnatural flows of surface waters.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
This section presents both the geomorphology and water quality of the environmental setting, because the
geomorphologic characteristics and related processes in the study area, including erosion and sedimentation,
influence physical and biological aspects of the water quality conditions. However, some aspects of water quality
in the study area and in surrounding surface and groundwater bodies are independent of geomorphic
characteristics of the study area. Therefore, aspects of geomorphology and water quality that would not be
affected by the project are also discussed to provide perspective on the environmental conditions of the study area.
Geomorphology
Geomorphology is generally defined as the study of the processes that shape the surface of the earth and analysis
of the formation of landscapes. Environmental factors that influence geomorphic processes include climate and
weather, hydrologic conditions, local and regional geology, geologic history, and tectonics. The project study area
is located within the Sierra Nevada Geomorphic Province and, more specifically, the southern end of the Lake
Tahoe Basin. The basin has formed as the result of block faulting (i.e., tectonic movement) and damming of the
outlet of Lake Tahoe (Saucedo 2005:2). The Upper Truckee River occupies a valley developed on and underlain
by igneous and volcanic bedrock. Glacial deposits within the Upper Truckee River watershed reflect multiple
occupations of the valley by Quaternary glaciers. The presence of lake sediments record past high stands of Lake
Tahoe that inundated the valley.
River and hillslope processes have been the dominant recent geomorphic factors, resulting in creation of the
active floodplain of the Upper Truckee River and deposition of fluvial and alluvial sediments. The project study
area includes the reaches of the river closest to its mouth at Lake Tahoe and its confluence with Trout Creek, a
major tributary. The deposition of sediment at this distal end of stream forms the Upper Truckee Marsh. The
geomorphology of the area is also influenced by lake processes, which contribute to the creation of a beach and
beach berm complex at the northern end of the study area.
River Reaches
Three geomorphically distinct reaches have been identified along the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek
within the study area (Conservancy 2003:4-1) that are generally associated with the “valley,” “meadow,” and
“marsh” portions of each stream (Exhibit 3.9-1). Reach 1 is the area within a relatively narrow valley immediately
north (downstream) of the U.S. 50 bridge on each stream. Reach 2 is the transition zone from the narrow valley to
the broad floodplain, including the main meadow shared by both streams. Reach 3 is the marsh reach, which has
numerous distributaries and a lagoon along Trout Creek, but is a single straight channel along the Upper Truckee
River.

Prior to modern urban development, the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek were affected by nearly 100 years
of watershed-scale changes in land use, hydrology, and sediment loads, and on-site uses (e.g., Comstock-era
logging and log transport, early 1900s irrigation dams and ditches, and grazing). In the 1950s and 1960s, the
Upper Truckee River channel was directly modified within the study area for urban development: distributaries
were cut off and filled, the main channel was straightened and deepened, and the mouth and lagoon were
periodically dredged. The following reach descriptions are of existing conditions, rather than an estimate of the
undisturbed (i.e., pre-Comstock) conditions:
►

►

Reach 1 of the Upper Truckee River is about 3,100 feet in length and includes an active, main (or primary)
channel, as well as secondary channels that carry flow only during large flow events.
Reach 2 of the Upper Truckee River is a 3,500-foot single-thread,1 slightly meandering channel.

►

Reach 3 of the Upper Truckee River is a relatively straight, deep, and wide channel. The single-thread reach
extends about 3,900 linear feet to the river mouth.

►

Reach 1 of Trout Creek is a 2,900-foot single-thread, meandering channel.

►

Reach 2 of Trout Creek is about 3,775 feet in length and includes two meandering channels: a main (low­
flow) and secondary channel.

►

Reach 3 of Trout Creek is about 2,900 feet in length and includes several distributary channels that branch off
the main channel to flow north through the marsh/lagoon (Exhibit 3.9-1). The lagoon of Trout Creek meets
the Upper Truckee River about 240 feet upstream of the beach ridge, while the main channel of Trout Creek
enters the Upper Truckee River another 90 feet upstream.

The Upper Truckee River channel position has been largely unchanged since the late 1950s. However, in Reach 1,
the low-flow channel has switched position between branches (possibly in response to flood and drought events,
log debris jams, and beaver dams). The Trout Creek channel position has also been relatively static since the late
1950s. In the 1980s, bed and bank stabilization was installed on Trout Creek to protect public sewer lines,
reinforcing the location of the east branch of the stream.
River Profiles
Both the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek have very low-profile gradients (i.e., channel bed steepness)
within the study area. The average streambed slope of Trout Creek is 0.00106 (0.106 percent) and that on the
Upper Truckee River is 0.00155 (0.155 percent). The profile steepness varies by reach on each stream. Trout
Creek has a higher bed elevation (relative to the river) and a fairly consistent bed slope of 0.00085 (0.085 percent)
in Reach 1. The slope steepens slightly to 0.00099 (0.099 percent) in the floodplain and meadow of Reach 2. The
steepest slope on Trout Creek (0.00138 or 0.138 percent) is found within a short transition zone of Reach 3 that
extends down from the meadow to the lagoon and lake. The Upper Truckee River bed in Reach 1 is lower and has
a steeper slope of 0.0041 (0.41 percent) than Reach 1 on Trout Creek. The Upper Truckee River transitions to an
even lower floodplain and meadow slope of 0.00089 (0.089 percent) in Reach 2. Past channelization and dredging
have lowered the channel bed elevation throughout much of Reach 3 of the Upper Truckee River, resulting in an
extremely low bed slope (0.00017 or 0.017 percent) (Exhibit 3.9-2).
The different bed elevations and profile shapes on the two streams (Exhibit 3.9-2) reflect differences in floodplain
processes and lake interactions. The Trout Creek channel bed is higher (i.e., nearer to the floodplain/meadow
ground surface), remaining above the median lake level (approximately 6,226 feet National Geodetic Vertical
Datum [NGVD]) through most of the site, except along the 1,800 feet of channel closest to the lake. In contrast,
the Upper Truckee River channel bed elevation is lower than the median lake level for nearly 5,000 feet upstream
1

The term “single-thread” indicates that one primary active channel of the river is present (as opposed to multiple channels).

of the lake. Therefore, the Upper Truckee River channel is more affected by backwater from the lake. Whenever
the lake rises, more of the Upper Truckee River channel onsite would be inundated by lake waters than would
Trout Creek.
Channel Capacity
Historical alterations of the river and watershed and related channel response have resulted in increased crosssectional area of the channel of the Upper Truckee River. Because of this increased cross-sectional area
throughout the study area, the frequency and area of inundation by overbank flows (i.e., floodplain connectivity)
has been reduced. A flow of at least 1,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) is required before the Upper Truckee River
overtops its banks throughout most of the study area, and at least 1,212 cfs is required in some of the larger
single-thread channel sections (Conservancy 2003:4-19). This magnitude of streamflow is close to the estimated
5-year recurrence interval2 peak flow (see Section 3.8, Table 3.8-3). The capacity of the channel of the Upper
Truckee River exceeds 2,000 cfs in portions of Reach 1. In these portions of Reach 1, flows close to the 10-year
event magnitude may be contained in the channel. Because the oversized channel contains such large flows,
erosive forces on the banks are greater than would be expected for this very-low-gradient reach. In turn, the
exaggerated erosive forces create adverse erosion and water quality conditions, which are described in greater
detail below.
Along Reach 1 of Trout Creek, the estimated channel capacity ranges from about 150 to 200 cfs (Conservancy
2003:4-22), which is roughly between the 2- and 5-year estimated recurrence peak flows (see Section 3.8,
Table 3.8-3). Channel capacity on Trout Creek decreases in Reaches 2 and 3 in the multiple thread and
distributary channel areas. Therefore, flows overtop the channel banks more frequently and erosive forces are
lessened.
Streambank Erosion
Studies of sediment sources for Lake Tahoe included an estimation of contribution of streambank erosion to fine
sediment loads (i.e., sediment that is less than 0.063 millimeter [mm] in diameter) delivered to the lake by
individual tributary streams (Simon et al. 2003:ES-1; Simon 2006:618). The Upper Truckee River was identified
as the stream with the highest fine sediment loads contributed by bank erosion. Although these studies did not
make quantitative estimates of bank erosion for each reach of the river, the average annual erosion rate for fine
sediment from streambanks for the Upper Truckee River is 639 tons per year and approximately 63 percent of the
total fine sediment from its entire watershed (Simon 2006:635). The relatively large percentage of the total fine
sediment loads attributed to streambank erosion indicates the important effect of this process on water quality.
The total maximum daily load (TMDL) analysis of Lake Tahoe sediment load reduction opportunities (California
Water Boards and NDEP 2008:211-215) also produced quantitative estimates of erosion of fine sediment from
streambanks of the Upper Truckee River, including estimates covering the study area reaches (Table 3.9-5).
Although the study area reaches are nearly 12 percent of the total length of the river studied in this TMDL
analysis, the study area reaches account for only 4.7 to 6.3 percent of the fine sediment eroded from streambanks.
This indicates that the study area reaches have proportionally less streambank erosion than other upstream reaches
of the river. This is not unexpected, because the upstream reaches have steeper channel slopes, greater
percentages of banks actively failing, and in some locations, a greater proportion of fines in the banks than the
study area reaches. These data are consistent with the relative pattern of bank failure observed by reach within the
study area. The greatest bank erosion is within the study area in Reach 1, likely because there the channel is
eroding against the side slope of the valley. Although the absolute values of estimates from the TMDL analysis of

The magnitude, or amount, of streamflow is generally described as discharge at a point (i.e., the volume of flow per unit of time).
Discharge is variable over time in response to changes in precipitation and water runoff. Expected flow event (or flood) is defined by the
probability that a certain rate of flow is possible in any one year. For example, the “100-year flood” is the rate of flow with a 1 percent
chance (1 in 100) occurring any one year; a 5-year flood has a 20 percent chance (1 in 5) of occurring.

Overbanking
In natural alluvial stream systems, the form and capacity of the active channel are generally developed such that
high frequency flows (e.g., typical seasonal variations in discharge) are contained within the banks. Less frequent,
larger flows result in overtopping of the banks and inundation of portions or all of the floodplain. Normal
overbanking is considered to occur when the channel overtops during a 2-year recurrence streamflow event.
In other words, a naturally or normally functioning stream would be expected to typically overbank, on average,
approximately during one event (for a period of several days to a couple of weeks) every couple of years. The
relatively large channel capacity of the majority of the Upper Truckee River within the study area severely limits
the opportunity for flows to reach or overtop the banks during the typical snowmelt season (Table 3.9-3).
Therefore, streamflow (and the sediments and nutrients conveyed by the flow) is rarely able to spread out on the
floodplain. To illustrate the reduction in overbanking, 35 years of recorded streamflow data were statistically
analyzed and indicate that channel reaches with a capacity of 1,000 cfs would only overtop an average of just
three–five days yearly, and reaches with a capacity of 2,000 cfs would not overtop (Table 3.9-6). The enlarged
river channel reduces the potential for sediment deposition on the floodplain and, therefore, results in increased
transport of fine sediment through the study area and to the lake (Stubblefield et al. 2006:287-302). In spatial
terms, the lengths of existing Upper Truckee River streambank in the study area that would be overtopped during
a 2-year streamflow event (760 cfs), for median and low lake levels, are estimated to be 2,129 feet and 1,520 feet,
respectively (Conservancy and DGS 2005:Appendix A). This indicates that less than 10 percent of the channel
length within the study area would support normal overbanking processes.

In contrast to the river, Trout Creek has a relatively less incised channel and greater floodplain connectivity
(Stubblefield et al. 2006:287–302). The channel capacity for Trout Creek ranges from about 150 to 200 cfs in
Reach 1, decreasing somewhat in Reaches 2 and 3. The channel would be overtopped between the calculated 2­
and 5-year recurrence peak flows in Reach 1, and more often in Reaches 2 and 3 (Conservancy 2003:4-22). The
channel capacity of Trout Creek allows more flows to reach or overtop the banks during the snowmelt season than
does the channel capacity of the Upper Truckee River (Table 3.9-7). Under the existing channel conditions,
streamflow (and the sediments and nutrients conveyed by it) spreads out on the floodplain for over a week (about
10–11 days per year on average) over the entire season.

Floodplain
Most of the study area is a floodplain that is shared by the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek under maximum
streamflows and lake levels. In major floods, the waters from both streams mix in the middle of the marsh. For
smaller streamflows and lower lake levels, the area of floodplain wetted by each stream becomes distinct and the
area of mixing is limited to the mouth reaches or the lagoon and mouth reaches. The area and duration of
floodplain inundation is affected by many variables on each stream, and in turn influence the location and amount
of floodplain sedimentation.
To describe existing conditions and allow comparison with the conditions resulting from the proposed alternatives
along the Upper Truckee River, modeling (HEC-RAS) of potential inundation area was performed. This modeling

used topographic cross sections and water surface profiles along with digital elevation surface analysis (using
GEO-RAS). The modeling assumed a 2-year recurrence streamflow (760 cfs) and a median starting lake level.
The inundation area is less if lake level is lower, and is greater if lake level is higher.
For existing topographic and geomorphic conditions, the modeled floodplain inundation area is 65 acres, covering
a narrow and discontinuous area (Exhibit 3.9-3). In the upstream half of the site (approximately River Station
[RS] 0+00 to RS 40+00), inundation is restricted to the area alongside channels. In the center of the site
(approximately RS 40+00 to RS 70+00), some overflow from the channel onto the floodplain occurs, along with
backwater up into side channels or ditches, or both. In the downstream portion of the site (approximately
RS 70+00 to RS 92+00), overflow is relatively broad on both sides of the channel, particularly in the recently
restored Lower West Side Restoration Area wetlands.
Although the Upper Truckee River has reduced frequency and extent of overbank flows under existing conditions,
some overbank flow and floodplain sedimentation does occur. Stubblefield and others (2006:287–302) measured
how differences in the frequency and extent of overbank flows in various parts of the Upper Truckee River and
Trout Creek floodplain affected suspended sediment and total phosphorus loads during the 2003 snowmelt season.
Measurements indicated that as water depths and floodplain connectivity increased, sediment retention on the
floodplain also increased. Greatest sediment and nutrient retention were measured for water flowing through the
lagoons and beaver dam backwater areas of the marsh (more or less Reach 3) on Trout Creek.
Soil cores taken from the marsh indicate that net sedimentation has been occurring on both the Trout Creek and
Upper Truckee River portions of the study area (Winter 2003:64). Since the 1950s, the average vertical accretion
rates have been 0.25 inch per year on the Trout Creek floodplain and 0.35 inch per year on the Upper Truckee
River floodplain. These modern net sedimentation rates are significantly greater than rates averaged over the last
~1,650 years (0.032 inch per year) or over the last ~4,620 years (0.028 inch per year [Winter 2003:65]). The mass
sedimentation rates on the study area are greater than at Pope Marsh (Kim 1999:25, Winter 2003:78), where net
biological accumulation/decomposition of groundwater-supported peat (Green 1998) may play a stronger role in
vertical accretion of the marsh surface than deposition of mineral material.
River Mouth(s)
Analysis of historic maps and aerial photographs from 1861 through 2002 was performed to study the location(s)
and dimensions of the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek as they enter Lake Tahoe (Conservancy 2003:3-11).
These data indicate that the position of the mouth of the Upper Truckee River has laterally migrated about 1,000
feet over about 150 years. The migrated location has ranged from 750 feet west (in 1860s and 1914) to 275 feet
east of the present location of the mouth. The oldest maps suggest that Trout Creek and the Upper Truckee River
had a single outlet to the lake, similar to present conditions. However, some historical photographs (from 1940
and 1965) show a separate Trout Creek outlet through the beach ridge to the lake. A separate Trout Creek mouth
has been observed recently during and following large flood events (e.g., in 1997 and 2005). The location of a
separate Trout Creek mouth has been consistent, although the frequency and duration of a direct discharge from
Trout Creek to the lake at this location is not known.
The historical aerial photograph analysis also documented that the Upper Truckee River mouth has ranged from
around 50 feet wide to over 250 feet wide since 1940 (Conservancy 2003:3-11), with no clear trend over time.
The river mouth widths in the photographs would be expected to vary in relation to lake level and streamflow,
with a wider river mouth generally associated with larger flows and higher lake levels. However, the river mouth
width at any given time (or photograph) could also reflect preceding conditions (such as a drought or flood),
vegetation density at the mouth, and alteration by dredging and straightening.

Lagoons
The dynamic interaction of river and lake processes at the mouth of the Upper Truckee River results in a range of
geomorphic features, including the formation of a beach, beach berm, and lagoon environments. Natural
influences on these processes include variable river flows and sediment transport and changing wave conditions,
lake currents, and lake levels. Under undisturbed conditions, transport of sediment along the beach probably
caused the mouth of the river to close during low streamflow conditions and formation of a lagoon behind
(landward of) the beach berm. The existing conditions of the Upper Truckee River mouth, beach, and lagoon
system have been modified from predisturbance conditions by a combination of watershed-scale changes in land
use, hydrology and sediment supply for the beach, the raising and regulation of the Lake Tahoe outlet, sitespecific land and water use (e.g., Comstock-era log rafting and transport), and the navigation channel(s)
construction and maintenance since the 1950s (Conservancy 2003:3-23). The direct alterations have included
dredging to deepen and widen the mouth of the Upper Truckee River, excavation and dredging to create the
former boat launch area (i.e., the Sailing Lagoon), and later, the placement of fill to disconnect the Sailing Lagoon
and present marina from the river.
An indicator of changes in lagoon area is the total area of standing water observed on historical aerial
photographs. The relationship of water area in the study area to lake level generally displays an expected increase
with higher lake levels (Exhibit 3.9-4). Generally, the area of standing water increases as lake level increases.
This general correlation seems fairly strong for the data in the extreme range of lake levels (e.g., lake levels
6,220–6,222 feet and 6,228–6,229 feet NGVD). However, there is considerable variation in the data points
representing a relatively narrow lake elevation range (e.g., 6,225–6,228 feet NGVD), suggesting that factors aside
from lake level are important controls. Several other factors may also produce the observed pattern: river mouth
and back beach topography; groundwater levels; surface water flow (via stream channels or overbank flooding);
evaporative losses; and temporary dams and diversions by beaver or humans (Conservancy 2003:3-26).
Lagoon-area changes over time may reflect human impacts on the lagoon system (Conservancy 2003:3-23). For
example, at relatively high lake levels (6,226–6,228 feet NGVD), the older photographs display smaller areas of
standing water than more recent images. Also, the area of standing water at median lake levels (approximately
6,226 feet NGVD) has decreased since the 1970s. These patterns may reflect changes resulting from dredging of
the river mouth, channel incision, beach erosion or excavation, or some combination of these processes, along
with historical groundwater pumping and sedimentation (i.e., filling) of the lagoon environment. At high lake
levels, lake water can more readily enter the site through the current incised and dredged channel. At low lake
levels, surface runoff may more readily exit the site through the incised and dredged channel and by percolation to
groundwater in the lagoon area.
A comparison of the water surface area of the Sailing Lagoon to the lake level illustrates differences between this
artificially modified water body and the rest of the marsh (Exhibit 3.9-5). These data show that its constructed
shape (i.e., steep sided, deep, and surrounded by higher ground) maintains a surface area of water consistently
between 3 and 4 acres whether lake level is high and near legal maximum (e.g., 1999) or low and down to the
natural rim (e.g., 2002). The only case when the Sailing Lagoon is smaller than 3 acres is when lake level is below
the natural rim (e.g., 1992). The other extreme is the 1965 photo, when the Sailing Lagoon had a very large
connected water area because the river mouth was dredged to allow navigation up the river mouth into the Sailing
Lagoon.
The Tahoe Keys Marina (TKM) occupies about 8 acres of land and 13.5 acres of water immediately west of the
study area (TRPA 2002b:1-1). The TKM water body has an open surface water connection to Lake Tahoe through
the East Channel and an open-water connection to the Sailing Lagoon within the study area. The water in the
TKM interacts with water in the channels of the Tahoe Keys via a circulation system, shared with the Tahoe Keys
Property Owners Association (TKPOA), that operates under a NPDES permit (Lahontan RWQCB 2004:1).
Therefore, under the present configuration and operations, the surface water of the marina and keys channels may
interact with that in the Sailing Lagoon.

Because the TKM is an artificial water body and its operation requires a navigation channel out into the lake,
dredging at the East Channel entrance to the TKM and out into the lake has occurred in the past and is expected to
continue. The maintenance dredging of TKM occurs under permits from USACE (CWA 404), the Lahontan
RWQCB (CWA 401), the California State Lands Commission, the California Department of Fish and Game
(CDFG) (lakebed alteration agreement), and TRPA.
Tahoe Keys Marina and Tahoe Keys Channels
The TKM maintenance dredging has used a couple of different methods (i.e., suction dredger and clamshell
bucket). Lahontan RWQCB (2005) Regional Board Order No. R6T-2005-0015 NPDES CAG616003 includes the
following discussion of maintenance dredging that indicates beach replenishment is not prohibited, but would
require permitting as a “complex” maintenance dredging project:
…A simple maintenance dredging project must meet all of the following criteria: (1) no
temporary on-site storage of spoils, (2) no on-site dewatering of dredged spoils, (3) no use of a
flocculent for settling spoils, (4) no discharge of decant water to surface waters, and (5) no beach
replenishment.
…If the dredging project includes fill below high-water or beach replenishment, the Discharger
must also submit a complete application for Section 401 Water Quality Certification in
accordance with Title 23, Section 3856 of the California Code of Regulations.
…Bypass dredging which involves beach replenishment by redeposition of dredged sediments
may be allowed on a case-by-case basis only if the Discharger can show through pre-project
substrate sampling that the dredged material is cleaner than the material that exists in the
proposed replenishment area.
Dewatering and settling of the dredged slurry and off-site disposal has been the environmentally preferred option
accepted by the Lahontan RWQCB and TRPA (TRPA 2002a). This is consistent with general BMPs requiring
that all dredged sediments be removed from the lake and disposed above its high-water rim (TRPA 2002b:3-7).
Sediments excavated during dredging at TKM have been removed from the area (i.e., hauled offsite), and
therefore have not been transported to or deposited in the lake or shorezone (TRPA 2002b:4-9). Bypass dredging
(which would redeposit sediment in another local area) has not been conducted. TKM has noted the potential
beneficial impacts of bypass dredging to leave coarse material in the littoral zone of the lake (TRPA 2002b:4-4),
but is uncertain whether this technique would be used for future dredging.
Beaches
The shoreline is a dynamic environment where wave action and lake-level fluctuations are dominant forces,
interacting primarily with sediment supply to control the size, elevation, and position of the beach. The study area
has two distinct beach areas, one on either side of the Upper Truckee River mouth (Exhibit 3.9-1). The beach west
of the river, known as Cove East Beach, is about 800 feet long and lies between the TKM East Channel and the
river. The beach east of the river, known as Barton Beach, is about 2,600 feet long and extends eastward from the
river to the Al Tahoe residential neighborhood.
In terms of waves and currents, the study area and its adjoining shallow lake areas within one–two miles east and
west likely behave as a littoral circulation cell (Orme 1971:10, Osborne et al. 1985:29). A distinct littoral cell has
also been identified between the mouth of the Upper Truckee River and the Ski Run Marina (Foxx, Nielsen, and
Associates 1989:8). The circulation pattern limits the possible sources of sediment for the study area beaches to
other beaches and the shallow nearshore of the lake within the cell.
Generally, beach sediment has four possible sources: local cliffs, offshore bars, the nearshore, and riverbed load
(Orme 1971:4-5). Under present conditions in the study area, the erosion of the beaches themselves has been

determined to be a larger source than the riverbed load (Osborne et al. 1985:9-10). These materials are delivered
to or removed from the beach by onshore/offshore wave transport and alongshore drift in lake currents (Selby
1985:359–360). Long-term beach sediment loss occurs when sediment is transported to deep offshore sinks (or if
dredging and upland disposal removes sediment from the river or shorezone).
Understanding changes in the study area’s beach and shoreline conditions over the geologic time scale (10,000–
100,000 years or more) is not critical for assessing changes resulting from the project. However, beach and
shoreline changes over shorter time scales, such as hundreds to thousands of years, provide important context for
evaluating the potential impacts of the project.
Over the last few thousand years, there have been substantial changes in the shoreline boundary near the study
area. During the mid-Holocene (about 5,000 years ago), lake level was several feet lower than at present and the
shoreline was about 0.25 mile farther north (Conservancy 2003:3-1). Over the next couple of thousand years,
runoff and lake levels increased, and the barrier beaches and backshore marshes may have been initiated (Adams
and Minor 2001:3).
Over the past couple hundred years, there have been substantial changes in sediment supply and hydrology that
also modified lake levels and shoreline conditions (Stine 1994; Heyvaert 1998, 2001; Conservancy 2003). These
include natural climate-driven shifts, the results of watershed-scale land use and vegetation changes, direct
management of the lake outlet at Tahoe City, and local dredging (Orme 1971:13).
Dramatic increases in sediment delivery to the lake occurred during the Comstock logging era, followed by
watershed recovery that reduced lake sedimentation rates between 1900 and 1970 (Heyvaert 1998:134)
(Table 3.9-8). Similarly, increased deposition in Pope Marsh between the 1880s and 1910s has been documented
(Kim 1999:34).

Historical maps are consistent with the lake and Pope Marsh indicators. The study area shoreline advanced from
1861 to 1914 (i.e., moved northward into the lake), from about 50 feet in some areas to as much as 200–300 feet
in other locations (Conservancy 2003:3-16). These data support hypotheses that greater watershed sediment
production and delivery to the lake during the late 1800s would have been accompanied or followed by shoreline
advance into the lake as sediment was mobilized, transported, and reworked over the following decade(s) (i.e.,
1890s to 1910s).
For the first half of the 1900s, nearshore sediment would not have been replenished from the watershed at the same
high rate as during the Comstock Era, which is a factor favoring shoreline erosion. Between 1914 and 1940,
historical maps and aerial photos show net shoreline erosion at the study area (Conservancy 2003:3-12): the Barton

Beach shoreline east of the 1940 Trout Creek mouth experienced retreat of 20–60 feet in some areas and as much as
50–190 feet in others; and the west side of the study area experienced retreat of as much as 300 feet, to about the
same position as in 1861. The 1940 shoreline between the mouths of Trout Creek and the Upper Truckee River did
not shift. These data indicate that shoreline erosion and retreat at the study area began prior to the Tahoe Keys
development, probably due to watershed sediment load changes and management of the lake outlet.
Considerable and continued shoreline retreat since 1939 has also been quantified (Adams and Minor 2002, 2001;
Conservancy 2003). The continued erosion may still reflect watershed sediment trends and lake level
management, but as exacerbated by local dredging. The following observations have been made from aerial photo
analysis of erosion at the study area since 1940 (Conservancy 2003: Chapter 3):
►

Between 1940 and 1995, the portion of the study area west of the Upper Truckee River mouth experienced net
shoreline retreat on the order of 90–120 feet, with 50–100 feet of retreat near the river mouth. Barton Beach
had net retreat ranging from 70 to 135 feet just east of the river, but less than 10 feet east of the Trout Creek
mouth (Exhibit 3.9-6).

►

Between 1940 and 1965, some local shoreline advance occurred on portions of the Barton Beach, but net
erosion followed from 1965 to 1983 (Exhibit 3.9-7).

►

Between 1971 and 1999, net shoreline retreat east of the Upper Truckee River mouth ranged from 35 to 50
feet and as much as 50–70 feet near the sand spit. However, some areas of sand deposition occurred over this
same period east of the river mouth (Exhibit 3.9-8).

Several local studies of beach and shoreline conditions conducted shortly after development of the Tahoe Keys
identified substantial net erosion (ranging from three to over 50 linear feet of retreat) for storm events in March
and June 1970 (Orme 1971, Budlong 1971). Comparison of lake bed surveys from 1922 and 1970 documented a
trend of net nearshore erosion and sediment loss of over 300,000 cubic yards (averaging greater than 6,000 cubic
yards per year) in the vicinity of the study area. While this loss was largely attributed to development impacts on
the channel and sediment delivery to the lake, more recent studies (Conservancy 2003:3-21) suggest that some
sediment loss may have begun prior to development.
Beach particle composition and shape data also indicate net shoreline erosion. The study area beach sediment is
primarily granitic sand of granule and small pebble diameters, with magnetite in the sand-size class (Orme 1971:5).
Osborne and others (1985) determined that the beach sediment morphology was enriched with irregularly shaped
and angular grains, indicating backshore erosion is now an important sediment supply to the beach.
An additional indicator of net beach erosion at the study area is the change in relationship of exposed, unvegetated
beach to lake elevation over the last 60 years (Exhibit 3.9-9). While generally showing the expected increase of
beach exposed at lower lake levels, the variations over time reflect net shoreline erosion, and flood and drought
cycles, as well as the Tahoe Keys development (Conservancy 2003:3-21). For example, historical aerial
photographs in 1940, 1952, 1965, and 1983 are all for lake elevations within about one foot of each other, yet the
two older, predevelopment examples have considerably more beach area.
The construction and maintenance of navigation channels, jetties, and small groins that cross through the beach
and/or extend from the beach into the nearshore have altered shorezone processes and affected beach conditions
west of the study area (Orme 1971:14-15). Historic grazing (discontinued after 2000) could have affected
vegetation and reduced dune stability, and was identified as a possible impact on shoreline erosion along Barton
Beach. Excavation, grading/leveling, and vegetation removal occurred at the former dune field west of the mouth
of the Upper Truckee River in 1969 (Budlong 1971:80).

Exhibit 3.9-9

Relationship of Study Area Unvegetated Beach Area to Lake Elevation (1940–2002)

Additionally, the sediment supply to local beaches has been adversely affected by maintenance dredging of the
Tahoe Keys navigation channels during the past 50 years. The long-term average annual dredging volume is about
800 cubic yards per year (Conservancy 2003:3-11). Replacement of sand to the beach or nearshore system via
bypass dredging or replenishment programs (i.e., artificial deposition) has not occurred. However, artificial beach
nourishment has been used on a limited scale at the west end of the study area after storm events (Budlong
1971:92). Unfortunately, these recent site-specific impacts exacerbate the background trends of beach erosion and
the reduced sand delivery by the rivers.
The volume of coarse sand supplied to the nearshore by either the Upper Truckee River or Trout Creek is meager
in relation to the shoreline length of the study area. Osborne and others (1985) determined coarse sand supply to
the beaches using a long-term average annual load rate of total coarse sediment (i.e., sediment greater than
0.0024 inch [0.062 mm]) of 2,800 and 1,400 tons per year for the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek,
respectively (Kroll 1976). Coarse sand supply from the Upper Truckee River was estimated to be 356 tons per
year (293 cubic yards per year), and that from Trout Creek was slightly greater, 377 tons per year (310 cubic
yards per year) (Osborne et al. 1985:9). For an active beach width of 25 feet, and assuming just one cubic foot
covering each square foot of beach area, the Upper Truckee has sufficient annual supply for a beach 316 feet long,
and Trout Creek can support a beach 335 feet long. This is much shorter than the shoreline of the study area and is
a much smaller total area (0.4 acre) than half the existing area at median lake level (Exhibit 3.9-5). Assuming only
one foot of depth is much shallower than the typical USACE beach nourishment rate of one cubic yards per
square foot. Making a more normal or typical thickness assumption indicates that river sand supply would only

support an even smaller beach area. Therefore, the average annual river sand supply is small, and clearly
inadequate to compensate for the long-term net beach erosion and continued dredging.
Water Quality
Water quality refers to a combination of characteristics (parameters) that can be quantitatively or qualitatively
described for a given water body. The parameters include pollutants, such as nutrients, suspended sediment,
bacteria, toxic elements or chemicals, and attributes important to biological resources such as pH, dissolved
oxygen, and temperature. There are several potential pathways for nutrients, fine sediment, and other pollutants to
enter waters of the study area. Several potential sources, sinks, and transformations of these constituents may
occur in the study area. Sources to the study area include streamflow, urban stormwater runoff, lake water,
groundwater flow, and direct atmospheric deposition. Watershed and site-scale monitoring of water quality has
been performed at varied times for various purposes, but site-specific data is limited. Most available water quality
information is for historical conditions of the surrounding water bodies such as Lake Tahoe, the TKM and
TKPOA channels, and the two main streams that flow through the study area. The information below is organized
by surface and groundwater categories, and is focused on topics that describe the existing water quality in the
study area or water quality parameters that may be altered by the project.
Surface Water
Lake Tahoe
Both the federal and California governments have designated Lake Tahoe an “Outstanding National Resource
Water” (Lahontan RWQCB 1995:5-1). In addition to aesthetic enjoyment, the exceptional quality of water in the
Tahoe Basin supports a number of beneficial uses related to human and environmental health, including drinking
water supply, water-based recreation, wildlife habitat, and aquatic life and habitat. Stringent water quality goals
and watershed regulations, along with mitigation and restoration measures have been implemented, particularly
since the 1980s. However, Lake Tahoe has been losing its famed clarity at a rate of nearly nine inches per year
since the late 1960s and has failed to meet transparency and clarity standards (Lahontan RWQCB and NDEP
2007a:25). The lake is considered “impaired” with respect to the aesthetic-recreation beneficial use under Section
303(d) of the Federal CWA. Development of a TMDL identified the pollutant sources, quantified the amounts of
pollutants the lake can accept and achieve the clarity goals, determined options for reducing pollutants, estimated
load allocations, and developed implementation and monitoring plans (Lahontan RWQCB and NDEP 2007a:13­
15). The Lahontan RWQCB approved Basin Plan amendments to establish the Lake Tahoe TMDL and an
implementation plan for associated changes to urban stormwater regulations on November 16, 2010 (Resolution
No. R6T-2010-0058). EPA approved the Lake Tahoe TMDL on August 16, 2011.
TMDL research has established that Lake Tahoe is impaired by excess nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) and
fine sediment inputs. Nitrogen and phosphorus stimulate algae growth, which in turn absorbs light and reduces
light penetration through the water (Reuter and Miller 2000). Fine sediments decrease clarity by scattering light as
the particles slowly settle through the water (Swift et al. 2000, Lahontan RWQCB and NDEP 2007b:261). Fine
mineral particles (i.e., particles less than 20 micrometer [µm] in diameter) have been shown to strongly affect
clarity and may be responsible for 60 percent or more of the transparency loss (because of their impact on light
scattering) (TRPA 2007:3-2, 3-3).
Pelagic Lake Clarity
Water clarity is measured using Secchi dish depth readings (of transparency) at established index locations on
Lake Tahoe. Year-to-year variability in transparency occurs, inversely related to precipitation and runoff amounts
(Jassby et al. 2003:1456). However, the overall trend has been a decrease in average annual Secchi depth from the
1967–1971 historic average of 97.4 feet (i.e., the California Standard numeric target) to 67.6 feet in 2006 (TRPA
2007a:3-11). Lake clarity varies by season, ranging from its lowest levels in May through June, to a secondary
low in December, and an annual high in February (TRPA 2002a:3-30). The seasonal pattern generally reflects the
AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Geomorphology and Water Quality

3.9-28

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

seasonal variation in suspended sediment loading from stream runoff, and the impacts of lake mixing. Substantial
vertical mixing can occur during summer (CWB and NDEP 2007:3-20) as a result of sustained summer wind
events. The December clarity minimum is attributed to consistent annual deep mixing. The winter average Secchi
depth in 2006 was 78.4 feet, less than the TRPA standard of 109.6 feet (TRPA 2007:3-30).
Nearshore Lake Clarity
Lake clarity is measured in the deep (pelagic) waters, but the area where clarity is most obvious to the casual
observer is in the littoral zone or “nearshore” (Lahontan RWQCB and NDEP 2007a:10*). There are varied
working definitions of the nearshore in specific studies (Orme 1971, Taylor 2002, Taylor et al. 2004) and in
regulations (e.g., Basin Plan vs. TRPA Code). Despite these variations, all of the definitions refer to portions of
the lake with water depths too shallow for Secchi depth measurements to be informative.
The optical water quality concern in the shallow nearshore zone is murkiness, as indicated by turbidity and
periphyton (i.e., attached filamentous algae). Turbidity is expressed in nephelometric turbidity units (NTU),
which are based on an empirical relationship to light transmission in standard concentrations of formazin (a white
powder) in water (Taylor 2002).
The study area is adjacent to the largest nearshore environment on the margins of Lake Tahoe. This area is
characterized by a shallow shelf that extends a few thousand feet out from the beach ridge (Orme 1971:4). The
nearshore lake waters adjacent to the study area consistently have the highest turbidity around the lake, and have
been occasionally greater than the TRPA WQ-1 threshold (Taylor 2002:20). Recent studies have recorded high
turbidity at both the mouth of the Upper Truckee River and the Tahoe Keys channel entrance. These studies
include data by Taylor (2002) of all locations less than 24.6 feet deep or within 656 feet of shore, and by Taylor et
al. (2004) of all locations up to 3.28 feet deep and extending offshore 328 feet or until the water is at least
98.4 feet deep.
At times when turbidity of the middle of the lake is very low (less than 0.06 NTU), the nearshore adjacent to the
study area had turbidity levels up to an order of magnitude greater than any other sampling location (Taylor
2002:11). The south shore (including the study area) was one of the three high turbidity areas with large extent
(more than 1.9 miles in extent and greater than 0.2 NTU) reported by Taylor (2002) from lakewide concurrent
sampling. Elevated turbidity (up to a maximum of 20 NTU after a storm events) off the Upper Truckee River
mouth was noted in 23 out of 23 surveys, and affects an area commonly extending 0.5 mile to the east, 0.3 mile to
the west, and 0.74 mile offshore (Taylor et al. 2004:48*). Turbidity in this area and in the adjacent West Al Tahoe
area was identified as “extremely elevated” relative to the middle of the lake.
The highest nearshore turbidity levels coincided with snowmelt and runoff periods characterized by the highest
ratios of mineral to algal particle content. Generally, lower turbidity is recorded in winter, but localized plumes of
increased turbidity linked to storm event inputs can occur. During spring peak runoff, water temperatures and
turbidity levels rise, and during the summer there is a widespread increase in turbidity.
During calm conditions, increased turbidity was due to organic particles, but during storm events, up to half the
particles were mineral composition (Shanafield et al. 2007:53). In all locations and times that nearshore turbidity
was moderately elevated (greater than 0.35 NTU), the particles were predominantly mineral material, except
within the Keys channels (Taylor et al. 2004:48).
Tahoe Keys Marina and Channels
Organic debris or living organisms that are considered noxious, invasive, or exotic to the biologic systems may
also be present in the water or sediment of the Sailing Lagoon, whether or not they directly affect water or
sediment quality. See the Sections 3.4 and 3.5 (Biological Resources: Vegetation and Wildlife, and Fisheries,
respectively) for further details on this related topic.

Tahoe Keys Water Quality
The water quality in the Tahoe Keys Marina and other Tahoe Keys channels has been studied as part of various
scientific and permit-compliance programs over many years, but the locations, parameters, and time frames of
each study have differed. The following discussion is organized by study, with the most recent information
presented first.
Studies have documented high levels of turbidity in the channels of the Tahoe Keys. In 2001 and 2002, the two
navigation channels and the immediately adjoining nearshore in the lake have had turbidity levels that are an
order of magnitude greater than any other sampling location (Taylor 2002). Channels in the Tahoe Keys had very
high turbidity (greater than 0.5 NTU), with plumes of particularly high turbidity (values in excess of 2.0 NTU)
(Taylor 2002:11). In 2003, channels in the Tahoe Keys had “moderately elevated” average turbidity greater than
0.4 NTU and a maximum turbidity greater than 1.5 NTU (Taylor et al. 2004:49).
The contribution of the Tahoe Keys channels and their configuration on lake turbidity is not well understood.
Surface water in the Marina and Tahoe Keys channels can only enter the lake through the east and west
navigation channels. Their outflow is highly time-dependent and seasonally variable. The relative contribution to
nearshore turbidity from the Tahoe Keys versus outflow of the Upper Truckee River has not been determined
(Taylor et al. 2004:50). However, observations during periods when lake currents were moving the Upper
Truckee River outflow away from Tahoe Keys indicate the lake was only moderately affected by outflow from
the Tahoe Keys and boat traffic resuspension (Taylor et al. 2004:51). Also, organic materials were always the
dominant source of turbidity inside Tahoe Keys, but inorganic materials dominate as the source of turbidity in the
lake (Taylor et al. 2004, Shanafield et al. 2007).
The Tahoe Keys channels and marina are served by the TKPOA circulation system, which operates under a
NPDES permit (R6T 20004-0024; Board Order CA0103021-WDID No. 6A090090000 (Lahontan RWQCB
2004). The system included the TKPOA water treatment plant, which operated periodically between 1975 and
1998 (TRPA 2002b:3-6). A chemical release from the treatment system resulted in toxic levels of aluminum in
August 1998, and the plant has not operated for treatment since that time. Only the circulation system portion of
the plant is currently permitted and operational. The system circulates untreated water between May and October,
exchanging water between the Tahoe Keys lagoons (110 acres), Tallac Lagoon (45 acres), and the TKM (32 acres,
including the Sailing Lagoon). There are 13 outfalls, including one in the TKM (Lahontan RWQCB 2004:2-5).
The permits have required water quality sampling at a point at the East Channel inside the marina (Point M,
which is near the Sailing Lagoon) and at a point in Lake Tahoe at the East Channel outside the marina (Point
MLT) since 1998. Monitoring (typically between July and October in most years) indicates that marina turbidity
exceeded the 1.0-NTU limit in 1998 and 2005. Total phosphorus generally was below 0.1 milligram per liter
(mg/L), except in July 2007. Total nitrogen was generally below 0.15 mg/L except in October 2005 and July
2007. Testing showed detections for various hydrocarbons between 1998 and 2000, but nondetection in more
recent monitoring.
During the period 1993 to 1997, water quality at the TKM was investigated to evaluate the potential impacts of
motorized watercraft, with sampling around the Fourth of July and Labor Day holidays (Lahontan RWQCB 2005,
and prior permit files). Marina water samples consistently exceeded the 1.0-NTU turbidity level between 1993
and 1997. Total nitrogen exceeded 0.15 mg/L for all samples between 1993 and 1997 except in July 1997. Total
phosphorus exceeded 0.01 mg/L in all samples between 1993 and 1997, except July 1995; July, August, and
September 1996; and June 1997. Hydrocarbon and other contaminant detections have occasionally occurred, but
nondetectible results were common by 2004. Routine sampling of the marina water was discontinued and is not
required under the present permit (GA 09S0122415).
There has been monitoring of stormwater runoff from the commercial/industrial portions of the TKM facilities,
and reporting of any spills or incidents. The present TKM SWPPP requires stormwater/nonstormwater
observations and sampling in the marina parking, storage, and maintenance areas (Tyler, pers. comm., 2008).
Review of SWPPP monitoring reports indicates that no stormwater releases were sampled because no release

events were reported during daylight hours and/or no events exceeded the installed BMP capacities. Only one
spill was reported between 2002 and 2007. The spill was on April 10, 2007, and consisted of three–five gallons of
hydraulic oil that was contained and cleaned up.
Water and sediment in the marina have also been sampled in association with permitted maintenance dredging,
most recently in 2002 (WDID 6A098805007). The 2002 dredging included excavation in the East Channel and
the approach channel in the lake. During dredging, dewatering fluids were discharged to a portion of the study
area south of East Venice Drive (Conservancy Parcel Assessor’s Parcel Number 22-210-37). Water discharged to
the Upper Truckee meadow was required to have less than 20 NTU turbidity and nutrient levels less than 0.1
mg/L total phosphorus (TP) and less than 0.5 total nitrogen (TN). Water sampled on September 23, 2002, had
turbidity of 17.6 NTU in the river and 2.0 NTU in the TKM channel, while the lake turbidity was 0.31 NTU. TN
exceeded 0.15 mg/L in the TKM channel (0.2 mg/L) and in the river (0.26 mg/L), while the lake had TN of
0.14 mg/L. Total phosphorus exceeded 0.1 mg/L in the river (0.019 mg/L) and the lake (0.014 mg/L), and was
highest in the TKM channel (0.024 mg/L). No volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) were detected in the river or the TKM channel water, but 0.03 part per billion (ppb)
naphthalene (a PAH) was detected in the lake.
Tahoe Keys Sediment and Organics
In addition to water samples, sediment from the TKM channel and the lake nearshore were also tested in
September 2002 and the results were reported as part of the dredging permit monitoring data. The sediment
samples had much greater concentrations of TN and total phosphorus than water samples, reflecting the
propensity of these materials to attach to sediment particles. The TKM channel sediment concentrations of
nutrients (57 mg/L TN and 150 mg/L TP) were much less than the concentrations in lake sediments (560 mg/L
TN and 310 mg/L TP). One of the TKM channel sediment samples contained 30 ppb acetone (a VOC), while no
VOCs were detected in the lake sediments. Both the lake and the TKM channel sediments had some detectable
PAHs, but the TKM channel had more species present (about ten) and for the PAH species detected in both
locations, the concentrations were greater in the channel than in the lake.
In addition to these recent studies, sediment and interstitial water of the channel versus lake sediments were also
analyzed by the University of California, Davis Tahoe Research Group in 1995 (TRPA 2002b). The 1995 study
found nutrient levels in sediment interstitial water to be much greater in the marina (lagoon) than in the lake or in
beach sediment (which was sampled at Valhalla Beach), and the nutrients were in more biologically available
forms. However, the 1995 study found the marina and east channel sediments to be “unpolluted” with respect to
either heavy metals or oil and grease. In addition to the presence of PAHs, it is possible that aluminum (Al)­
contaminated sediments occur in the TKM as residual from apparently heavy application of aluminum sulfate
during initial dredging of the keys.
Tributary Streams
There are 63 perennial streams tributary to Lake Tahoe and 54 intervening areas (without stream channels) that
contribute runoff to Lake Tahoe (Tetra Tech 2007:3). The streams in the study area are the largest (Upper Truckee
River) and third largest (Trout Creek) tributaries to the lake. Stream water quality sampling on major Lake Tahoe
tributaries has been conducted since 1980, including sampling stations on the Upper Truckee River and Trout
Creek near U.S. 50. Data collected at these stations indicate the water quality of streamflow entering the study
area.
Average annual nutrient and suspended sediment sampling results for the two streams for water years (WYs)
1980 to 2005 and their relation to TRPA threshold standards are shown in Exhibits 3.9-10 to 3.9-13.
Nutrient concentrations in the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek often exceed Basin Plan objectives and
TRPA threshold criteria. Average annual total phosphorus concentrations in both the Upper Truckee River and
Trout Creek exceeded the Basin Plan objective of 0.015 mg/L in all years and exceeded the TRPA threshold

criteria of 0.03 mg/L in about two-thirds of the years (Exhibit 3.9-10). Average annual TN concentrations
exceeded the Basin Plan objective of 0.19 mg/L in 59 percent of the years on Trout Creek and in 76 percent of the
years on the Upper Truckee River (Exhibit 3.9-11). The TRPA total nitrogen standard of 0.22 mg/L was exceeded
in 53 percent of the years on Trout Creek and in 41 percent of the years on the Upper Truckee River
(Exhibit 3.9-11). The total iron concentrations in both the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek have only been
sampled since WY 1989, but consistently exceeded the Basin Plan objective and TRPA standard of 0.03 mg/L
(Exhibit 3.9-12), perhaps because of high natural background levels. The average annual total suspended sediment
concentrations on Trout Creek did not exceed the TRPA standard of 60 mg/L, and only one year on the Upper
Truckee River exceeded the standard (Exhibit 3.9-13).
An evaluation of median suspended sediment concentrations of the 10 largest tributaries to Lake Tahoe from 1993
to 1998 indicated that the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek at U.S. 50 ranked sixth and fifth, respectively
(Rowe et al. 2002:94). During this period, the minimum concentration of suspended sediment in the Upper
Truckee was 1 mg/L, the maximum was 458 mg/L, and the median was 16 mg/L. During this same time, the
minimum concentration of suspended sediment in Trout Creek was 2 mg/L, the maximum was 335 mg/L, and the
median was 14 mg/L.
Although average suspended sediment concentrations in the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek do not usually
exceed water quality standards, these streams contribute much greater suspended sediment loads than any other
tributary to Lake Tahoe because of their large flow volumes. Suspended sediment loading becomes more
substantial with the evidence that a substantial portion of phosphorus enters Lake Tahoe as particulate phosphorus
adsorbed to the sediment (Reuter and Miller 2000).
Monthly suspended sediment loads on the Upper Truckee River demonstrate, as expected, year-to-year variations
that generally track precipitation and overall streamflow volume variations (Rowe et al. 2002:114). Annual
suspended sediment loads on the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek for all years of record since 1960 (using
the sediment rating curves from Simon et al. 2003 and Simon 2006) also display a wide range of values. The
lower estimated sediment loads are generally under 1,000 Tons/year (T/year) during drought years on the Upper
Truckee River and about a third of the years on Trout Creek. The high end of the range, about 8,000 T/year or
more, occurred during wet years: WY 1983 on both streams and during WY 1997 on the Upper Truckee River.
Various estimates of average suspended-sediment loads for the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek have been
calculated by different studies for different data periods (Table 3.9-9), all within the same order of magnitude.

Because of the importance of fine suspended sediment to lake clarity, estimates of fine sediment loads have also
been made. Simon (2006) calculated fine (less than 0.063 mm) sediment loads (metric tons per year [MT/yr])
from mean daily flow data using the sediment-rating relations developed in Simon et al. (2003). He also estimated
the number (flux in n/year where n = number of particles) and proportion of fine particles (fine particles defined
as less than 0.02 mm distinguished from fine sediment defined as less than 0.063 mm) using relations between the
sediment mass and particle numbers established by Rabidoux (2005).

The calculated annual load of fine (less than 0.063 mm) sediment for the Upper Truckee River is 1,010 MT/yr and
462 MT/yr for Trout Creek (or 19.4 and 8.9 percent of the total annual suspended load for the streams,
respectively) (Simon 2006:24). The Upper Truckee River fine sediment load and fine particle flux are the highest
of all tributaries in the Tahoe Basin, and Trout Creek ranks third and fourth for sediment load and fine particle
flux, respectively (Simon 2006:24). While the suspended sediment yields (per unit watershed area) estimated for
the Upper Truckee River (6.0 tons per year per square mile) and Trout Creek (4.8 tons per year per square mile)
are “moderate” relative to other watersheds at Lake Tahoe, the sheer size of these two watersheds increases their
loading to the lake (Simon et al. 2003:ES-1). Rowe et al. (2004) found that the seasonal pattern of sediment
loading generally follows runoff variability. The highest seasonal median loads for the Upper Truckee River
occur during snowmelt months of April, May, and June, as for suspended sediment. The largest median monthly
loads for all measured constituents occurred in May. The lowest seasonal loads occurred in summer (July, August,
and September) with the lowest monthly loads usually in August, September, or October (Rowe et al. 2002:115).
Statistical analysis has been conducted to look at trends over time in suspended sediment and other constituents
(Rowe et al. 2002, Simon et al. 2003). Simon et al. (2003) identified a possible decreasing trend in annual total
and fine-grained sediment loads on the Upper Truckee River while Trout Creek had no trend. The trend for the
Upper Truckee River may indicate long-term watershed recovery from past disturbances (Simon et al. 2003:7-4).
Shifts in the suspended sediment rating curves also highlight changes over the period of record. Sediment loads
on the Upper Truckee River first increased during the period 1983 to 1992 and then decreased from 1993 to 2002
to values lower than recorded for 1972 to 1982 (Simon et al. 2003:3-31). Short-term analysis of suspended
sediment data from before and after the 1997 flood event showed a statistically significant decrease in the rating
curve after the flood event (Simon et al. 2003:3-14). The decrease resulted from flushing of readily available
sediment from the channel system by the major flood event.
Floodplain Deposition
Soil cores within the Upper Truckee Marsh have been analyzed and age dated to identify sedimentation processes
and rates over the past few thousand years (Winter 2003:64-65). The age of the sediments at the base of the dated
cores ranged from 1,650 ± 50 to 4,620 ± 40 years before present (BP). Average mass sedimentation rates during
the last 50 years (0.6 gram per square centimeter per year [g/cm2/yr]) are an order of magnitude greater than for
the rest of the period recorded by these cores (0.05 g/cm2/yr) (Winter 2003:86). These data indicate that the
modern marsh surface is accumulating and retaining sediment, despite channel deepening and widening that has
reduced floodplain connectivity, especially on the Upper Truckee River. However, even these relatively high
sediment retention rates represent a very small percentage of the modern sediment load being transported by the
streams and surface runoff. Winter (2003) estimated that less than five percent of the average annual suspended
sediment transported to the Upper Truckee Marsh is retained. Most suspended sediment continues to be delivered
to the lake.
While most of the sediment retained on the floodplain represented deposition of suspended sediment,
sedimentation of bedload (i.e., coarser sediments) occurred in one area along the west branch of Trout Creek near
the middle of the marsh (Winter 2003:79). The other location with modern bedload sedimentation was not on the
floodplain, but at the mouth of the Upper Truckee River (which may receive bedload from both streams) (Winter
2003:79). This indicates that bedload is able to be conveyed through the study area to the lake, although some net
retention of bedload occurs in the middle marsh and at the river mouth.
Observations at the study area during the 2003 snowmelt season documented modern patterns and amounts of
suspended sediment and total phosphorus retention within the Upper Truckee Marsh (Stubblefield et al. 2006).
Using sediment budgets constructed from turbidity, suspended sediment correlations, and discharge data at seven
sampling stations within the study area, Stubblefield et al. (2006) describe and compare water quality impacts of
Trout Creek versus Upper Truckee River, and floodplain versus marsh portions of the study area. The Trout Creek
system retained 68–90 percent of the suspended sediment and 61–85 percent of the total phosphorus (Stubblefield

et al. 2006:296). The Upper Truckee River system retained only 26 percent of the suspended sediment and
24 percent of the total phosphorus (Stubblefield et al. 2006:296). Streambank erosion was observed along the
Upper Truckee River within the study area during 2003, so streambanks were a net source of sediment during part
of the study period (although moderate sediment retention occurred overall, as stated above). The greatest
retention was in the marsh reaches in areas of distributary channels and/or ponding (Stubblefield et al. 2006:297).
Ponding increased the spreading of water across the floodplain. As water depths and floodplain connection
increased later in the runoff season, sediment retention on the floodplain increased. Sedimentation in the marsh
reach of Trout Creek retained all particle sizes measured (1–1,000 µm), even fine particles less than 10 µm
(Stubblefield et al. 2006:298). The 2003 mass sedimentation rate (approximately 0.029 g/cm2/year) observed by
Stubblefield et al. (2006) was only about five percent of the rate measured for soil cores over the past 50 years
(approximately 0.6 g/cm2/year) (Winter 2003:86). However, the rate is similar to the modern period average
(0.027 g/cm2/year) measured in lake cores (Heyvaert 1998; see Table 3.9-8 above). Notably, WY 2003 did not
include large or sustained periods of overbank flow. The variations in the rate suggest that floodplain
sedimentation from large flood events is probably important in the overall net accumulation under existing
conditions.
Lake and River Interaction
Limited information is available regarding the mixing of lake and river water in the adjacent nearshore or within
the study area. The mixing pattern and depth of river inflow and lake water is affected by temperature, density,
and streamflow (Perez-Losada and Schladow 2004). Additionally, the depth at which river water enters the main
lake body can potentially have a substantial influence on lake clarity (CWB and NDEP 2007:3-21). Taylor et al.
(2004) documented seasonal differences in the extent of mixing of river and lake waters and the size of highturbidity plumes in the lake. During winter (January 2003), the river inflow was colder than the surface of the
lake, and formed a plume of cold, turbid water that plunged to depth because it was denser than the lake surface
water. During spring (June 2003), the river inflow was warmer than the surface of the lake, and formed a broad
plume of warm, turbid water that did not mix readily because it floated on top of the relatively colder and denser
lake water. The river inflow and lake water interactions in the nearshore are controlled primarily by factors not
affected by conditions in the study area.
However, the study area’s geomorphic and topographic conditions do affect mixing of river and lake water within
the study area. The riverbed and portions of the marsh and lagoon are several feet below median lake elevation
and the gradient of the river channel is very low. Therefore, water from the lake may penetrate for nearly 1 mile
upstream (Exhibit 3.9-2) during periods of elevated lake levels. The enlarged, straightened channel of the Upper
Truckee River becomes an arm of the lake with low velocities that favor deposition on the channel bed when the
lake is high (Stubblefield et al. 2006:298). However, the material deposited on the channel bed is not stabilized by
vegetation compared to deposition on a floodplain (Stubblefield et al. 2006:298). When lake level is lower, the
river mobilizes materials deposited on the channel bed, and delivers these materials to the lake. The extensive lake
backwater does raise water surface elevations in the channel and slightly “improves” the potential for overbanking
onto the floodplain.
The effect of elevated sediment (and associated nutrient) loading is particularly adverse within the littoral zone of
Lake Tahoe. Generally defined by TRPA as extending to a depth in the lake of 100 feet, the relatively shallow
conditions of the littoral zone allow for the penetration of sunlight for productive aquatic plant growth. Increased
turbidity and algal growth promoted by sediment and nutrient loading inhibits light penetration and the growth of
aquatic plants that provide a food source and habitat for fish and other organisms.
Urban Runoff
The east, south, and west sides of the study area adjoin areas of urban development. Stormwater runoff is directed
from these local neighborhoods to several outfalls that enter the study area along its meadow and forest margins.
In a few locations, stormwater outfalls discharge directly to the stream channels.

Constituents of concern in urban runoff include sediment, nutrients, petroleum products, pesticides, heavy metals,
organic matter, and coliform bacteria. Toxic “priority pollutants” in urban runoff include lead, zinc, copper,
arsenic, chromium, cadmium, nickel, cyanide, and asbestos (Lahontan RWQCB 1995). Deicing chemicals used in
these areas and “sanding” operations used on highways in the winter are also a major concern for water quality in
the Lake Tahoe/Truckee region.
Between 1986 and 1989, the Lahontan RWQCB sampled urban runoff on six sites in South Lake Tahoe for total
nitrogen, total phosphorus, total iron, and turbidity (TRPA 2002a). Samples collected exceeded state standards for
all constituents on several occasions, with the highest concentrations occurring in late spring through late summer.
TRPA monitored untreated urban runoff discharge at 10 culvert outlets to Lake Tahoe from 1991 to 1995.
Approximately 80 percent of the samples exceeded TRPA and state water quality standards.
Runoff from uplands with urban land uses has been identified as producing the largest fine sediment particle load
to Lake Tahoe (348 x 1018 particles/yr), the highest total phosphorus load (18 MT/yr), and the second largest TN
load (63 MT/yr) of the major source categories in the Lake Tahoe TMDL (CWB and NDEP 2007:4-165).
Stormwater runoff from urban areas has substantial pollutant concentrations (Hevyaert et al. 2006) and higher
volumes and peak flows than undeveloped areas. Monitoring around Lake Tahoe during 2003–2004 was used to
determine event mean concentrations for runoff from several urban land uses (Gunter 2005, Heyvaert et al. 2006)
as input to recent TMDL modeling. Some of the land use categories developed for the TMDL are representative
of land use in and immediately surrounding the study area (Table 3.9-10). These event mean concentrations
provide an indication of the existing water quality of untreated urban runoff that enters the study area. No on-site
monitoring data are available.

Other On-site Water Quality Data
The Lahontan RWQCB collected water quality data from 12 sampling sites on the Upper Truckee River and Trout
Creek (2000 to 2002), including up to six sites within the site (Conservancy 2003:12-17). The primary purpose
was to determine fecal coliform concentrations in areas heavily utilized by domestic animals (primarily cattle) and

wild animals. In general, fecal coliform was greatest during mid-summer (July and August), with no apparent
trend with downstream position (Conservancy 2003:12-19). In 2000, fecal coliform concentrations varied widely
by location and by month. For example, September average values for all sites ranged from 4.6 Most Probable
Number (MPN)/100 milliliters (mL) to 767 MPN/100 mL. From June to August, the average values at one site
ranged from 12.3 MPN/100 mL to 692 MPN/100 mL. During the 2001 and 2002 sampling periods, maximum
fecal coliform concentrations were much less (13–95 MPN/100 mL, respectively) than during the 2000 sampling
period (36–950 MPN/100 mL), possibly due to reduced grazing activity since 2000.
The Lahontan RWQCB also collected baseline nitrogen and phosphorus data in August and October 2000. Total
phosphorus concentrations ranged from 0.019 to 0.042 mg/L, and consistently exceeded the water quality
objective of 0.015 mg/L (Conservancy 2003:12-22). Total nitrogen analysis was not performed, but
concentrations of nitrate-nitrite (as nitrogen) ranged from 0.02.6 to 0.044 mg/L (Conservancy 2003:12-22).
As part of Winter’s (2003) marsh research project, five stations located in the study area (four on the Upper
Truckee River and one on Trout Creek) were sampled in spring and summer 2001 for pH, conductivity, total
Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ammonia (as N), nitrate (as N), soluble phosphorus, TP, and carbon. Results from the
analysis suggest that low nutrient levels occur during spring (Conservancy 2003:12-18).
Groundwater
Groundwater, and the constituents contained therein, can enter the study area via underground flow from adjacent
areas. Groundwater inputs include percolation from surface water, groundwater discharge to Upper Truckee River
and Trout Creek stream channel beds and banks. There are also groundwater interactions with Lake Tahoe.
Generally, groundwater flows from the study area toward the lake. However, a narrow zone of the study area near
the lake may have net subsurface flow from the lake for short periods of time of elevated lake levels.
Groundwater Nutrients
Groundwater has been identified as a relatively large source of the TN load (50 MT/yr) to the lake and a relatively
minor source of total phosphorus load (7 MT/yr) to the lake, but is assumed not to be a source of fine sediment
particles (CWB and NDEP 2007:4-165). Groundwater loading to the lake from groundwater Subregion 3 on the
south shore (which includes the study area) was estimated to be just 0.04 percent of the total dissolved N load and
0.6 percent of the total dissolved P load (USACE 2003:4-42). The study area is within a zone of limited
groundwater discharge to the lake due to the low groundwater gradients and the impacts of groundwater pumping.
Groundwater quality data have not been collected in the study area, but Loeb (1987), Rowe and Allander (2000),
and the U.S. Geological Survey have sampled groundwater quality at four wells (Al Tahoe West, Sky Lake
Lodge, Helen 2, and Tahoe Keys 1 wells) surrounding the study area (Exhibit 3.9-14). These wells may have
groundwater quality similar to the study area because they are close to the site and up gradient. The groundwater
data collected in these studies are discussed further in the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project
Processes and Functions of the Upper Truckee Marsh report (Conservancy 2003:Chapter 2).
Groundwater studies in the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek watersheds have noted generally increasing
nutrient concentrations down valley in the direction of regional groundwater flow (Rowe and Allander 2000:36).
Some seasonal effects have also been observed, such as lower groundwater phosphorus concentrations in the fall
than in the summer (Rowe and Allander 2000:36). Studies of the potential impact of stormwater infiltration basins
on groundwater quality found that, while typical urban stormwater poses little risk of migrating hydrophobic
hydrocarbons, a nitrate plume into shallow groundwater may occur during spring snowmelt at some of their
sampling sites (2nd Nature 2006a:19).

Several sites that had methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) groundwater contamination from leaking underground

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA
For this analysis, significance criteria are based on the checklist presented in Appendix G of the State CEQA
Guidelines; the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist; factual information; scientific data; and regulatory
standards of federal, state, and local agencies. In development of mitigation measures for significant impacts of
the project, effects on environmental thresholds of the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact were considered. The
project’s effects on thresholds are further described in Section 4.5, “Consequences for Environmental Threshold
Carrying Capacities.”
CEQA Criteria
Under CEQA, an alternative was determined to result in a significant effect related to geomorphology or water
quality if it would:
►

violate any water quality standards (CEQA 1),

►

create or contribute to runoff water that would include substantial additional sources of polluted water
(CEQA 2), or

►

otherwise substantially degrade surface water or groundwater quality (CEQA 3).

NEPA Criteria
An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the
environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the proposed action. Under NEPA, the significance
of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account
under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are
encompassed by the CEQA criteria used for this analysis. NEPA requires documentation and discussion of any
beneficial effects of a project in addition to its negative impacts. Where appropriate, these beneficial effects are
discussed and called out specifically for the purposes of NEPA in the following impact analysis.
TRPA Criteria
Based on TRPA’s Initial Environmental Checklist, an alternative would result in a significant impact on
geomorphology and water quality if it would:
►

result in continuation of or increase in wind or water erosion of soils (TRPA 1);

►

create changes in deposition or erosion of beach sand, or changes in siltation, deposition, or erosion, including
natural littoral processes, that may modify the channel of a river or stream or the bed of a lake (TRPA 2);

►

result in discharge into surface waters or in any alteration of surface water quality, including temperature,
dissolved oxygen, or turbidity (TRPA 3);

►

result in the potential discharge of contaminants to the groundwater or any alteration of groundwater quality
(TRPA 4); or

►

result in an effect on drinking water sources located within 600 feet of the project (TRPA 5).

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
The impact analysis has been completed using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods performed
by a hydrologist/geomorphologist and civil engineer experienced in river restoration in general and the Tahoe
Basin environment specifically. Information for the project site and vicinity and professional experience on
similar projects have been referenced and incorporated into the analysis of the river system history, existing
conditions, likely future conditions, and conditions expected under each action alternative.
Climate change effects on future geomorphology and water quality are incorporated in the No Project/No Action
Alternatives evaluation. However, even the most geographically and temporally focused available forecasts of
climate change effects on hydrologic parameters (Tetra Tech 2007) have relatively large variability and
substantial uncertainty. Due to this variability and uncertainty, a range of climate change scenarios, not just end
members or a midline scenario, are considered. Depending on the scenario, the statements are expressed in only
qualitative terms.
The impact analysis examines the effects of each alternative over the short term and long term for each of the criteria
listed above. Short-term effects are defined as those that would be temporary and could occur over hours, days, or
weeks during the active construction phase. In addition, the river system is expected to undergo changes following
construction as vegetation matures and the river reoccupies and adjusts to the restoration project, so the short-term
analysis also looks at interim effects that might occur during the first few years following construction, assuming
that streamflows are at least average, and also considers conditions if a large flood event (approximately 25-year
peak flow) occurs within five years after construction.
Wherever federal, state, or local water quality standards applicable for the region must be attained and maintained
pursuant to Article V(d) of the TRPA Compact (TRPA 2004), the strictest standards are used as the significance
criteria for this project; therefore, the project effects must meet or exceed such water quality standards to earn a
less-than-significant conclusion, recognizing that any violation of a water quality standard is considered a water
quality impact without taking in account the extent and duration of that impact. Based on informal agency
consultations during alternatives development and analysis, the Lahontan RWQCB’s numeric and narrative water
quality standards are the most stringent factors for significance determinations. Violation of any of the numeric
water quality limits or narrative standards in the objectives of the Basin Plan (see Table 3.9-2 for examples), or
actions inconsistent with the “nondegradation” objective, would result in a significant impact for this analysis.
While it is possible that other water quality parameters could be affected by a project alternative, the “turbidity
standard” (i.e., <10 percent above natural background) appears to be the most sensitive measure that is likely to be
affected by potential construction in and along the river channel. The applicable limit is related to the Lahontan
RWQCB’s narrative turbidity standard for receiving waters in the Basin Plan, which states that “Waters shall be
free of changes in turbidity that cause nuisance or adversely affect the water for beneficial uses. Increases in
turbidity shall not exceed natural levels by more than 10 percent” (Lahontan RWQCB 1995:5.1-9).
Natural turbidity levels range widely by season with flow magnitudes and the availability of sediment to be
entrained. Over the past several years, most turbidity sampling on the Upper Truckee River has been conducted
via grab samples as part of volunteer monitoring or research programs, along with some sampling during
construction activities. For example, a citizen’s volunteer water quality monitoring event called Snapshot Day,
held in May each year, typically includes sites on the Upper Truckee River: in Christmas Valley; one in the
downstream end of the Middle Reach (Mosher property); and a couple of sites near the river’s mouth. May 2002
samples had turbidity readings ranging from 0.12 NTU to 1.61 NTU (in the Mosher Reach). May 2003 samples
had turbidity readings ranging from 0.3 NTU to 0.98 NTU (near the mouth). May 2005 samples had turbidity

readings ranging from 2.43 NTU (near the mouth, but above Trout Creek) to 3.47 NTU (Christmas Valley)
(TRPA 2002c). Additional grab samples were collected at two sites on the Upper Truckee River and two sites on
Angora Creek on four dates in 2008 (January, March, the May 10th snapshot day, and in July), but none were
over 4.5 NTU (Sierra Nevada Alliance 2008).
During the summer of 2008, Upper Truckee River and Angora Creek were sampled at multiple stations on the
same dates as part of a Tahoe-Baikal Institute program. The Upper Truckee River samples ranged from less than 1
NTU at Meyers and by the Elks Club to less than 1.5 NTU at U.S. 50/Lake Tahoe Boulevard. The Angora Creek
samples ranged from less than 0.5 NTU at the headwaters (by Angora Lakes) to just over 1 NTU at View Circle
and nearly 3 NTU near the confluence with the Upper Truckee River (Tahoe-Baikal Institute 2008). Restoration
project–specific water quality compliance monitoring for the Upper Truckee River Reaches 3 and 4 during
construction included numerous grab samples between July 21 and September 4, 2008, along with continuous
monitoring from September 5 to October 7, 2008 (Taylor, pers. comm. 2010); none of the grab samples were over
4 NTU. Median values during continuous monitoring remained between 1 and 3 NTU both upstream and
downstream of the construction site for the restoration project, although a few brief spikes exceeded 10 and even
100 NTU for 10- to 20-minute periods. The brief turbidity spikes were associated with miscellaneous background
disturbance (by recreation users and animals) upstream of the construction, as well as potential constructionrelated effects at least on one date (Taylor, pers. comm., 2010; Conservancy 2008).
The only continuous turbidity monitoring that spans multiple seasons and locations on the Upper Truckee River
was conducted by CSLT (2nd Nature 2006b). This monitoring included three sites along the Upper Truckee River
beginning in April 2002 (for a partial water year) and throughout WYs 2003, 2004, and 2005. The background
turbidity levels (between storm events) were generally under 15 NTU and often less than 10 NTU. Short duration
peaks exceeded 100 NTU (and a few exceeded 500 NTU) in all years, but the season when peak values occurred
was not consistent, ranging from the onset of fall rains to snowmelt season and brief summer storms.
Background turbidity levels on the Upper Truckee River are typically extremely low (i.e., less than 10 NTU),
especially during summer construction season; therefore, very small changes from the natural state (an increase of
<1 NTU) could result in a violation of the Basin Plan standard. Water with turbidity less than 10 NTU, and
especially less than 5 NTU, generally appears clear to the naked eye. Thus, a potential violation in this range can
be determined only with sensitive instrumentation that is appropriately deployed, calibrated, and maintained
(USGS 2005: TBY-47). Additionally, the Basin Plan provides no narrative or numeric distinction regarding the
season or duration of a turbidity increase to be considered detrimental, so an increase more than 10 percent over
natural, of any duration, could be considered a violation of the standard as written in the Basin Plan.
Potential violations of the narrative turbidity standard at the low end of the NTU range, while considered a
significant impact for CEQA/NEPA/TRPA analysis (as stated above), would not necessarily correspond to an
adverse effect on Lahontan RWQCB–defined beneficial uses. For example, an effect on aesthetic values under the
Non-Contact Recreation Use designation in the Basin Plan (Lahontan RWQCB 1995:2-2) is considered by the
Lahontan RWQCB to be the first (i.e., most sensitive) indicator of an effect on beneficial uses (Kemper, pers.
comm., 2010). If persistent visible turbidity from the project site were to occur—particularly during the summer
recreation period when flows are low, recreation use is high, and background conditions would exhibit low
turbidity (i.e., good background clarity)—this visible turbidity would potentially impair noncontact recreation
beneficial uses. However, the turbidity values that would correlate with this impairment of aesthetics-related
beneficial use might not occur unless turbidity was increased beyond natural seasonal background by several
orders of magnitude (i.e., well beyond the <10 percent increase limit in the turbidity standard of the Basin Plan).
Summer turbidity levels would also likely need to exceed the minimum aesthetic criterion to have adverse effects
on other beneficial uses, including those supporting aquatic organisms. The project alternatives would have to
elevate turbidity considerably above ten percent over background to impair beneficial uses; however, the stringent
ten-percent-above-background turbidity standard is used as a significance threshold for this EIR/EIS/EIS because
of the CEQA checklist question regarding violation of “any water quality standard.”

EFFECTS NOT DISCUSSED FURTHER IN THIS EIR/EIS/EIS
Effects on Drinking Water Sources (CEQA 1, 3; TRPA 4, 5)—There are five groundwater supply wells within
600 feet of the study area boundary (Exhibit 3.9-14). These wells are sources of public and private drinking water.
All of the wells are outside of construction/disturbance areas proposed by any of the alternatives and are located
upgradient from affected areas. Therefore, there would be no substantial potential for disturbance of or
contaminant releases to the wells. The effect of each project alternative (i.e., promotion of increased inundation of
the floodplain) would be to generally increase recharge to the uppermost water-bearing zones; the project
alternatives would not adversely affect groundwater supplies. Although the specific rates and quantities of
increased recharge are not known and the effects would be generally low compared to other regional recharge
effects, the potential for increased infiltration to groundwater supplies would be beneficial.

(Alt. 1)

Short-Term Risk of Surface Water and Groundwater Degradation during Construction. (CEQA 1, 2, 3;

channel of the Upper Truckee River, sections of Trout Creek, along the Tahoe Keys Marina (Sailing Lagoon),
and near the shoreline of Lake Tahoe. Although temporary BMPs would be implemented, short-term risks of
water quality degradation could occur in each summer construction season or over the intervening winters.
Grading would result in ground disturbance within sensitive lands and increase the potential for erosion and
sediment transport. Accidental releases of hazardous materials or other pollutants could affect surface or
subsurface waters. Implementing Alternative 1 could result in short-term turbidity exceeding the Basin Plan’s
stringent turbidity standard (10 percent above background levels). Although the Conservancy would implement
Environmental Commitments 5 and 6 to protect water quality, this impact would be significant.

Construction activities under Alternative 1 would include large-scale grading operations and construction of
permanent facilities (a bridge, boardwalk, streambed and bank structures, and two self-service kiosks).
Implementing Alternative 1 would require four years of seasonal construction (between May 1 and October 15),
with winter closedowns except for BMP maintenance and monitoring. Construction would disturb areas in
uplands, as well as in the active floodplain of the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek and the main channel of
the Upper Truckee River.
The extent of “in-channel” (i.e., area of channel that normally carries flows year-round) work would vary by year.
Installing the new bridge and constructing grade controls, bank protection measures, and transitional connections
between channel segments would require work in the active channel. Reconnection of meanders and construction
of new meanders, portions of the floodplain reconstruction, and filling of abandoned river segments would be
conducted “off-channel” (outside of the active channel). Nearly all of the disturbance areas, access routes, and
staging areas would be within the 100-year floodplain. Using motorized construction equipment would require the
use of fuels, lubricants, and other hazardous materials. If accidentally released (particularly during in-channel
construction activities), these materials could potentially discharge to water bodies; pollutants released to the
surface could migrate to groundwater.
As discussed in Chapter 5, “Compliance, Consultation, and Coordination” and in Environmental Commitment
(EC) 6, “Obtain and Comply with Federal, State, Regional, and Local Permits” (Table 2-6), the project would
acquire permits and approvals from several entities (e.g., El Dorado County, TRPA, the Lahontan RWQCB,
USACE, and the CDFG). Those permits and approvals would impose conditions and requirements to minimize
the risks of construction-related water quality degradation by sediment or other pollutants. The general types of
permit documents and their components are known; however, the specific measures, performance standards, and
enforcement elements would not be established until after selection of the project alternative and completion of

the project design. For purposes of this analysis, any violation of any duration and magnitude would be potentially
significant within the strict thresholds necessary for CEQA compliance.
Exact erosion control measures (i.e., BMPs) and their performance standards have not yet been specified.
However, general BMPs would include the use of construction fencing, silt fences, straw bales, temporary settling
basins, vegetation protection, hydroseeding, and straw mulch to assure protection of water quality. To the extent
feasible, these water quality protection measures would be designed to be redundant so that if one means of
protection were to fail, a backup would be in place.
Construction activities that would occur within the existing streambed or streambanks (i.e., in-channel activities)
would require temporary dewatering of surface water in the river channel. Dewatering also could be required if
groundwater were to collect in active excavation areas. Conceptual approaches to dewatering have been identified
for various elements of the Alternative 1 in-channel work, but specific measures have not yet been determined.
The options for managing dewatered effluent would depend on seasonal conditions (including groundwater levels.
lake levels, and storm/flow events). The most likely options for reusing the effluent would be either to irrigate the
floodplain or to pump the effluent to containment areas on the floodplain. Direct discharges of effluent to the river
or to Lake Tahoe would not be allowed unless water quality standards were met. If volumes were relatively low,
the effluent would be pumped and used for irrigation. If volumes or rates of effluent generated were relatively
high, temporary containment areas would be created. The effluent would be pumped into the containment areas
and allowed to infiltrate and evaporate. The level of water in the containment areas would be monitored to
minimize the potential for overtopping. If necessary, advanced filtration would be used to treat effluent to a
standard that could be discharged back to surface water. The temporary containment areas could be removed at
the end of each construction season.
Newly constructed channel segments would be protected from flows; these areas would be isolated by water-filled
berms, earthen berms, and/or by other approved methods. Flow would not be diverted into the new channel for at
least two years as the planted vegetation became sufficiently established (i.e., during channel “seasoning”). All
disturbed areas to be reclaimed to natural habitat would be revegetated and irrigated appropriately. Although these
precautions would reduce the potential for erosion before stabilization, the possibility of inundation during the
stabilization period exists. The strict turbidity standard presented in Section 5.2 of the Basin Plan (i.e., turbidity
that is ten percent above background levels) could be exceeded if these areas were inundated.
Based on the conceptual information regarding proposed construction management for Alternative 1, water
quality standards may be violated, at least for short periods during each summer’s activities and/or over each
intervening winter and snowmelt season. The violations would be likely to occur because of the large scale of
grading and construction activities that would occur adjacent to the Upper Truckee River channel and floodplain,
and especially because of the close proximity of construction to the river mouth and Lake Tahoe. Efforts would be
made to work as quickly as possible to move from initial disturbance through final revegetation throughout the
study area, but disturbed areas likely would be exposed to winter conditions between summer construction
seasons. Winterization protection would be needed throughout the construction zone, and possible overwinter use
of staging, storage, or access areas has not yet been determined.
All temporary stormwater controls and/or overwinter flood flow protections would be designed and sized to meet
typical regulatory requirements (e.g., 20-year rainstorm for stormwater, 50-year peak streamflow). They could be
overwhelmed by a larger storm event if it were to occur during the construction period. However, the probability
that an event of greater magnitude would occur during either the summer low-flow seasons or the intervening
winters is low and such a larger event is not reasonably foreseeable.
In addition, the Basin Plan’s strict turbidity standards would likely be exceeded during the initial stages of use of
the new channel. Flushing flows would be released to clean the new channel before activation; however, these
flushing flows would not be likely to create a condition in which the turbidity of the water would be less than
10 percent above background levels. Shortly after activation, turbidity levels are expected to return to upstream

background conditions. Despite efforts to minimize risks, these effects would likely result in a violation of the
Basin Plan’s turbidity standard.
However, the Conservancy would implement EC 5, “Prepare and Implement Effective Construction Site
Management Plans to Minimize Risks of Water Quality Degradation and Impacts to Vegetation.” The measures in
EC 5 would prevent surface-water and/or groundwater degradation that could be of sufficient magnitude and
duration to impair the Upper Truckee River’s beneficial uses, including visible turbidity that could impair
aesthetic values or affect other beneficial uses. This commitment would avoid environmental damage to the river
and its beneficial uses. Impairment of beneficial uses would likely require considerably higher turbidity levels,
orders of magnitude above the river’s very low background levels. However, as mentioned previously, in
accordance with CEQA thresholds, the significance conclusion for this environmental document is based on the
potential to violate the Basin Plan’s turbidity standard. Therefore, this impact would be significant.
All feasible measures to avoid, minimize, or mitigate this impact have already been incorporated into the design of
Alternative 1. However, these measures would not be sufficient to fully mitigate the potential for at least short-term
violations of the Basin Plan’s stringent water quality standard for turbidity. Because the potential to exceed this
stringent standard would remain, Impact 3.9-1 (Alt. 1) would be significant and unavoidable.
IMPACT
3.9-2
(Alt. 1)

Short-Term, Project-Related Risk of Surface Water Degradation Following Construction. (CEQA 1, 2, 3;
TRPA 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) The biotechnical streambank treatments and other revegetated areas, such as the
backfilled channel segments, of Alternative 1 could be vulnerable during a flood flow within the first few years
following construction. Furthermore, some of the proposed treatments would prompt aggradation and could
result in channel adjustment following construction. Therefore, implementing Alternative 1 could result in shortterm exceedance of the Basin Plan’s stringent turbidity standard (ten percent above background levels) after
the construction phase. This impact would be significant.

Construction activities under Alternative 1 would include construction of grade control structures to foster
channel aggradation between RS 29+00 and RS 63+00. This alternative would rely on natural geomorphic
processes to redistribute sediment and allow vegetation stabilization within that subreach following construction.
These adjustments, while intended to achieve net deposition (aggradation), may include localized erosion and
redistribution of channel sediment that induces turbidity.
Under Alternative 1, the new, geomorphically sized channel constructed between RS 63+00 and RS 93+00 and
the small areas of inset floodplain in the upstream portion of the study area would be relatively susceptible to
erosion (compared to the well-established, undisturbed vegetated surfaces) if a large flood were to occur within
the first few years after construction. The risk of sediment mobilization may increase slightly if a major flood
event were to occur before the vegetation could mature.
A possible risk of water quality degradation within the first few (approximately five) years after construction
could arise from two potential mechanisms:
►
►

expected natural channel adjustments in accordance with the project design and/or
a large flood event (e.g., 25-year recurrence or greater) occurring in the first few years after construction.

A natural channel adjustment effect could occur where engineered designs were implemented. In particular, such
adjustments would be expected as normal postconstruction channel dynamics for sites where the selected
restoration design would not impose the final channel size, shape, or bed and bank materials directly during
construction. At least a few (approximately three-five) years of expected channel adjustments would likely be
needed for flows to approach or exceed the geomorphic design flow and reach equilibrium.
The potential magnitude and duration of water quality degradation would vary by the type and degree of channel
adjustment, but the effects could violate the strict water quality standards outlined in Section 5.2 of the Basin Plan
UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS

(i.e., the stringent turbidity standard of 10 percent above background levels). Channel adjustments, in the form of
streambed material sorting and/or net streambed or streambank erosion, could produce turbidity effects. The
effects would be greatest at each specific site of adjustment in the study area and would dissipate after the end of
each erosion event, but turbidity might be detectable and could extend to Lake Tahoe, at least for short periods.
Most possible channel adjustments would normally be expected to occur during periods of high streamflow when
the background turbidity levels are also high, which would reduce any project-specific contribution to turbidity.
Under Alternative 1, unexpectedly large flows could damage the active channel and/or backfilled channels, causing
instability that could continue beyond the initial flood event or propagate over time to affect additional locations.
This effect could also occur under existing conditions, and a flood flow of this same magnitude under existing
conditions or the No Project/No Action Alternative would also produce streambed and streambank erosion that
could mobilize some areas of the existing floodplain. However, implementing Alternative 1 would modify the
specific locations, areal extent, and soil/vegetation conditions that would be exposed to the flows in the channel or
across the reactivated floodplain. Localized increases in erosion and sedimentation could occur, potentially resulting
in violations of narrative or numeric water quality standards, at least briefly.
Design and revegetation specifications would be implemented for all reactivated channels and floodplain areas
with remnant channels to minimize the risk that accumulated fine sediments and/or organic materials would be
mobilized during a large flood in the first few years after construction. Despite these efforts to minimize risks, the
effects of a flood event could cause a violation of the Basin Plan’s stringent turbidity standard (ten percent above
background levels). For purposes of this analysis, any violation of any duration and magnitude would be
significant, in strict compliance with the impact thresholds under CEQA. Therefore, this impact would be
significant.
Mitigation Measure 3.9-2 (Alt. 1): Adaptively Manage Potential Flood Disturbance in the Interim Period after
Construction.
The Conservancy will develop and implement an adaptive management plan focused on the short-term water
quality degradation that could result within the first five years after construction. The plan will identify specific
data collection and monitoring protocols, describe decision-making processes and authorities, and list thresholds
for corrective actions. The performance criteria for the corrective actions will focus on preventing initial flood
damage or turbidity effects from becoming persistent, recurring, or chronic, whether the corrective action is
needed at the initial damage site or at other locations that could be affected by channel response to the initial
damage.
Significance after Mitigation: With implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.9-2 (Alt. 1) as described above, the
short-term risk of surface-water or groundwater degradation following construction would be minimized, because
potential flood damage in the interim period after construction would be adaptively managed. However, the
potential for at least short-term violations of the Basin Plan’s stringent water quality standard for turbidity cannot
be feasibly eliminated. Because of the potential to exceed this stringent standard, Impact 3.9-2 (Alt. 1) would be
significant and unavoidable.
IMPACT
3.9-3
(Alt. 1)

Upper Truckee River Channel Erosion within the Study Area. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 1 would
involve making direct changes to the channel of the Upper Truckee River. The changes would offset past
geomorphic responses to historic disturbances by reconstructing more appropriately sized channel sections
with better connectivity to the existing floodplain and constructing features to promote channel aggradation and
prevent streambank erosion. This would result in a substantial long-term benefit by improving channel stability
and reducing erosion of the channel bed and banks. This impact would be beneficial.

Alternative 1 would result in the development of about 3,900 feet of “geomorphically sized” channel (i.e., channel
designed to accommodate existing hydrologic/hydraulic conditions and efficiently convey expected flows and
sediment) (Exhibit 2-1). Under current conditions, approximately 500 feet of the existing channel is considered

geomorphically stable (Conservancy and DGS 2005:Table 5-1). The improvement in channel stability is expected
to reduce the potential for lateral migration of the channel. Additionally, bank stabilization proposed on the right
(east) bank of the river downstream of the U.S. 50 bridge would minimize the potential for continued erosion in
this area.
Vertical stability of the channel would be provided under Alternative 1 by the installation of seven vertical grade
controls in the channel between RS 14+00 and RS 64+00. These structures would serve as relative “hard points”
across the channel, minimizing the potential for downcutting (incision) and possibly promoting localized
deposition (aggradation). The alternative also proposes a bioengineered grade control structure near the river
mouth (RS 95+00) to minimize the potential for incision of the design channel resulting from the response of the
river to possible substantial and prolonged lowered lake levels.
Compilation of the TMDL streambank-erosion results (California Water Boards and NDEP 2008) for specific
subreaches of the Upper Truckee River allows a quantitative estimate of the effect of the proposed alternatives on
stream channel erosion (Table 3.9-11). Using the range of treatment tiers analyzed for the TMDL, the estimated
reduction in fine sediment loads from streambank erosion in the study area under Alternative 1 would be nearly
60 percent (reduced to 221 cubic yards from 538 cubic yards under existing conditions and the No-Project/NoAction Alternative). The study area is a small portion of the entire 15-mile-long river, and the proposed action
alternatives alone would reduce the entire Upper Truckee River’s fine sediment load from streambanks by about
7 percent relative to existing conditions. While small, this would be a considerable and measurable benefit
relative to the degraded existing condition or the No-Project/No-Action Alternative.

Alternative 1 proposes changes to the channel and overbank morphology that may alter the hydraulics of the
Upper Truckee River channel downstream of the U.S. 50 bridge. The alternative’s design includes bank
stabilization on the right (east) bank adjacent to and downstream of the bridge. Alternative 1 would involve
lowering the terrace to expand the floodplain area on the west side of the river downstream of the existing
pedestrian bridge (RS 05+00 to RS 11+00). Alternative 1 would improve direction of a portion of high flows into
the secondary channel. The project has evaluated the impacts of these channel modifications on water surface
elevations up- and downstream of the modified areas for the 5-year through 100-year flood events (and DGS
2005:Exhibits 4.7-1 and 4.7-5). The analysis indicates that the water surface elevations would remain unchanged
relative to the existing conditions downstream of (and at) the existing bridges. Therefore, no change in the
hydraulic conditions at the bridge is expected as a result of implementation of the alternative.
Alternative 1 includes features that would improve future protection of the bridge. The alternative would stabilize
the high eroding right streambank downstream of the bridge (including through protection of slope vegetation and
the slope toe). The stabilization would minimize future enlargement of eroded areas and protect the bridge from
future erosion at the hazard. Potential hydraulic impacts related to the proposed pedestrian bridge at RM 10+00
are addressed in Impact 3.8-3 (Alt. 1) in Section 3.8, “Hydrology and Flooding.”

This impact addresses long-term benefits associated with a net reduction of erosion. However, all stream
restoration projects, particularly those that incorporate geomorphic process–based adjustments as part of the
design elements, may experience localized channel erosion during an interim period following construction. The
potential adverse water quality impacts of such adjustments (including unexpected changes or responses to flood
disturbance) were described as a significant short-term impact above in Impact 3.9-2 (Alt. 1). The mitigation for
that impact, Mitigation Measure 3.9-2 (Alt. 1), requires implementation of an adaptive management plan that
commits to actions that would prevent short-term water quality problems from becoming chronic, thus ensuring
that the long-term improvements to Upper Truckee River conditions expected under Impact 3.9-3 (Alt. 1) can be
realized. This impact would be beneficial.
IMPACT
3.9-4
(Alt. 1)

Trout Creek Channel Erosion within the Study Area. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 1 would not involve
directly modifying the channel of Trout Creek. However, Trout Creek would be expected to adjust to the
proposed changes to the elevation and size of the Upper Truckee River channel in the vicinity of the mouth of
the creek. The anticipated response of Trout Creek would likely be deposition in the lowest reach, reducing the
potential for continued incision that previously was prompted by historical dredging and lowering of the Upper
Truckee River channel bed. This effect would be beneficial.

Under Alternative 1, the channel of the Upper Truckee River through the marsh (Reach 3) would be modified by
abandoning the existing straightened segment and constructing a new meandering channel (Exhibit 2-1). The new
channel would be narrower and its bed would be raised compared to the existing channel. These modifications
would include the confluence of the river with Trout Creek. The effect of raising the elevation of the Upper
Truckee River channel and mouth would likely initiate deposition at the confluence and within the lower reach of
the Trout Creek. The change would also reduce the potential for further incision (vertical erosion) of the creek.
Overall, modifying the Upper Truckee River channel would either have a neutral effect or reduce the potential for
erosion within Trout Creek.
No quantitative estimate of streambank erosion loads or load reduction potential along Trout Creek was made in
studies for the TMDL (California Water Boards and NDEP 2008). However, based on geomorphic principles and
qualitative analysis, Alternative 1 would not substantially change the amount of flow (and sediment) carried by
Trout Creek’s main channel and distributaries under normal or flood conditions. Although the modifications at the
mouth may promote some localized deposition, the low-gradient environment of the lower reach of the creek
would not be expected to be subject to substantial changes in lateral or vertical erosion. The effect on lower Trout
Creek would be slightly beneficial relative to existing conditions, because of the potential for reduced erosion.
As described above for the Upper Truckee River in Impact 3.9-3 (Alt. 1), implementing mitigation to prevent
adverse short-term water quality impacts from becoming chronic (Mitigation Measure 3.9-2 [Alt. 1]) would
ensure that the long-term improvements to Trout Creek conditions expected under Impact 3.9-4 (Alt. 1) can be
realized. This effect would be beneficial.
IMPACT
3.9-5
(Alt. 1)

Erosion of Backfilled and/or Remnant Channel Segments on the Floodplain. (CEQA 1, 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2,
3) Implementing Alternative 1 would involve backfilling portions of the existing Upper Truckee River to function
as part of the active floodplain, and would increase the frequency with which existing remnant channel
segments on the floodplain would be inundated. Following the project design details and specifications would
prevent “recapture” of the backfilled channel or an increase in erosive force on remnant channel segments that
could mobilize accumulated sediment and organic matter. This impact would be less than significant.

Alternative 1 would abandon and backfill existing Upper Truckee River channel segments between RSs 17+00
and 29+00 and between RSs 63+00 and 93+00 (about 4,200 feet). The abandoned channels would be filled with
floodplain sediments generated by construction of new channel segments, existing stockpiled sediments, and
imported sediments (if necessary). Lateral grade controls would be installed upstream and downstream of the

proposed intersections of backfilled abandoned channels with the newly constructed channel segments. The lateral
controls would be designed to resist erosion of the backfilled channels up to the 100-year flood event.
Alternative 1 may also incrementally increase the exposure of existing remnant (i.e., naturally abandoned)
channel segments on the floodplain to flood flows. The remnant channels are discontinuous, curved depressions
on the marsh surface that are partially filled with fine sediment and accumulated organic material. Alternative 1
would increase the area inundated during low-magnitude, high-frequency flow events (i.e., 2-year and 5-year
flows), but would not substantially alter inundation in the area during high-magnitude events (i.e., 25-year flows
or greater). The increased inundation from small floods might raise the potential for flow to enter remnant channel
segments and possibly erode them more often, but these areas would be subject to erosion from larger floods
under existing conditions. Additionally, the portion of the study area that would experience increased overbank
inundation under Alternative 1 does not include well-defined remnant channels. Therefore, the potential risk of
reoccupation and erosion of remnant channels under Alternative 1 would be small.
Following the project’s proposed specifications for backfill areas would prevent uneven placement of backfill,
differential compaction, or varied success of revegetation, which induce erosion of either the backfill or adjacent
natural soil/sediment. Potential erosion along the backfilled abandoned channel segments would be reduced. This
impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.9-6
(Alt. 1)

Retention of Fine Sediment and Nutrients within the Study Area. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 1
would directly reduce the Upper Truckee River’s channel capacity and raise the streambed elevation in the
lowest reach of the study area, make modifications that would reduce channel capacity and streambank height
in other subreaches, and restore lagoon features along the river and behind East Barton Beach. These
modifications would increase the frequency of overbanking, enlarge the area of functional active floodplain,
and offset past geomorphic adjustments to historic disturbances. Overtopping of the banks during small to
moderate flood peaks would result in a substantial improvement in fine sediment and nutrient retention on the
floodplain (i.e., marsh surface). This effect would be beneficial.

Alternative 1 proposes modifying the Upper Truckee River to generally raise the elevation of and narrow the lowflow channel (decreasing the channel capacity) and increase the frequency of overbanking events. With
implementation of Alternative 1, the length of channel experiencing overbanking during the 2-year recurrence
flow (at median lake levels) would increase from approximately 2,129 feet under existing conditions to about
12,145 feet (about 54 percent of new channel length, inclusive of both banks) (Table 3.9-12). The expected area
of inundation during such an event would increase from about 65 acres to 74 acres under Alternative 1.

The increased frequency and increased area of inundation during relatively frequent flow events would promote
the deposition of fine-grained sediment on portions of the floodplain that are not inundated as frequently under
existing conditions. During an overtopping event, streamflow would spread over a wider area, resulting in

decreased flow velocity and depth. These hydraulic conditions would favor the retention of sediment particles
transported by the storm flows. The retention of sediment and associated nutrients, including phosphorous and
nitrogen, on the floodplain would enhance nutrient delivery to marsh soils and vegetation. Additionally,
infiltration of water in inundated areas would increase soil moisture and would recharge (and temporarily raise)
shallow groundwater. The increased nutrient delivery and increased available water in the shallow subsurface
would improve conditions for riparian and marsh vegetation. The magnitude of these benefits would vary
depending on the timing and duration of inundation.
Alternative 1 would involve removing fill and grading the west streambank of the Upper Truckee River to
reconnect the existing Sailing Lagoon to the river, while isolating it from the dredged marina. Restoration of the
surface water connection with the river would increase the opportunity for overbank flows to convey sediment
and nutrients into the lagoon. Increased sediment retention and nutrient cycling in the lagoon relative to the
existing condition is an additional benefit beyond active floodplain inundation.
Alternative 1 would also include removal of sediment behind (landward of) East Barton Beach to recreate lagoon
and wet meadow conditions. These modifications would also increase the areas along the floodplain margin to
capture sediment and nutrients.
The combined effects of creating more stable channel segments, promoting more frequent overtopping events and
sediment deposition on the floodplain, implementing bank protection, and creating/improving functioning lagoon
and wetland environments under Alternative 1 would help to reduce transport of fine sediment to Lake Tahoe.
The proposed reduction of the river mouth’s capacity and retention of sediment would return long-term littoral
processes at the river-lake interface to a more natural regime. This impact would be beneficial.

(Alt. 1)

Decreased Delivery of Coarse Sediment to Cove East and Barton Beaches. (TRPA 2) Implementing
Alternative 1 could result in a net decrease in the transport of coarse sediment by the Upper Truckee River to
beach areas adjacent to its mouth. The reduction in coarse-sediment delivery could hinder beach
replenishment in the short term and worsen the ongoing trend of net beach erosion. In the long term, the
amount of coarse sediment transported through the study area would be similar to the amount transported
under existing conditions. Also, climate change effects could either exacerbate or counteract present trends. In
the long term, the potential effects could range from worse than the existing degraded condition to a possible
improvement. Any determination regarding long-term effects of climate change on coarse-sediment
transport and delivery downstream would be too speculative for a meaningful conclusion. In the short
term, however, implementing Alternative 1 would directly modify transport of coarse sediment and foster
deposition within various portions of the study area, which may temporarily decrease delivery of coarse
sediment to the adjacent beaches. This short-term impact would be potentially significant.

Under Alternative 1, the Upper Truckee River would be modified to develop a more stable channel and to
improve the natural interaction of the river with its floodplain and marsh environments. A goal of Alternative 1 is
to design and construct a channel that would minimize channel instability (particularly incision) and efficiently
convey flows and related sediment load. The design would include raising the channel bed and installing vertical
grade control structures. The structures would encourage localized deposition of bedload (coarse-grained
sediments). Therefore, some sediment would be expected to remain in temporary storage within the active
channel of the river. Given the design geometry of the proposed channel, each of the eight grade control structures
has the potential to result in the deposition of approximately 300 cubic yards of coarse sediment each for a total of
2,400 cubic yards (3,600 tons).
Estimates of the total annual sediment transport in the Upper Truckee River range from 439 tons per year (USGS
2002) to 17,040 tons per year (DSC 1969). Bedload transport is approximately ten percent of the Upper Truckee
River’s total sediment load (Swanson 1996), or 44–1,704 tons per year. Assuming all deposition promoted by the
proposed placement of grade controls necessary to achieve the streambed aggradation needed for Alternative 1
would occur over a relatively short period (one–five years), the retention would represent a substantial reduction
AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX

in the annual bedload transport of the Upper Truckee River near the mouth. The net short-term effect would be the
loss of bedload (coarse-grained) sediment transported via the mouth of the river and available to local beaches.
Additionally, the modified channel would be designed to promote development of bars, which could also
temporarily store sediment. This effect would be transitory because sediment forming the bars would migrate
downstream (and eventually to the mouth). Therefore, over time, the amounts of coarse sediment transported
through the study area would be similar to that input from upstream. The long-term effects on sediment transport
and input of coarse sediment to the littoral zone would be to restore a more natural regime.
Alternative 1 would involve connecting the river to the Sailing Lagoon (at high flows) and modifying the marsh
landward of East Barton Beach, providing increased potential for deposition and storage of coarse sediment
transported by the river and/or Trout Creek. If not controlled, the overflow of river flows into the Sailing Lagoon
could result in a permanent low-flow connection of the river to the lagoon. In the event that the area (“highlands”)
between the lagoon and design channel (approximate elevation 6,227 feet) were overtopped during a flood flow
when the water level in the lagoon was relatively low (e.g., a low lake level on the order of elevation 6,220 feet), a
channel could develop through incision of the highlands. If a permanent connecting channel between the river and
lagoon were created at relatively low flows, it could increase deposition and permanent storage of coarse sediment
in the lagoon. Final project design would include a flow control feature to manage water flowing into the Sailing
Lagoon during bank overtopping events when the lagoon’s starting water surface would be low. The control
feature (e.g., a rock-lined channel or weir structure) would be designed to control the location and minimum
elevation of overflow into the lagoon. It would prevent the development of a permanent, uncontrolled erosion
channel connecting the river to the lagoon at low flows.
However, as under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, potentially offsetting factors may result from climate
change in the long term. The net effect on river dynamics and beach erosion is highly uncertain. Even after
thorough investigation, any determination regarding climate change effects on coarse-sediment transport and
delivery downstream would be speculative.
Regardless of uncertainty about long-term effects of climate change, Alternative 1 has the potential to decrease
the delivery of coarse sediment to Lake Tahoe relative to existing conditions in the short term. The reduction in
sediment delivery could incrementally decrease replenishment of sand to the beaches at the south margin of the
lake. The decrease in replenishment could modify littoral processes and promote continued or increased erosion of
the beaches and reduced supply of sediment to dunes. This short-term impact would be potentially significant.
Mitigation Measure 3.9-7 (Alt. 1): Monitor and Adaptively Manage Delivery of Coarse Sediment to Cove East and
Barton Beaches.
During the period of channel adjustments following construction, and until the streambed profile attains a
relatively continuous slope within the study area, the Conservancy will monitor the supply of coarse sediment
entering the study area, deposition within the treated reaches, and beach-face erosion at least once a year.
Specifically, the Conservancy will make observations of net deposition or scour during low-water conditions. If
substantial coarse-sediment deposition is occurring within large portions of the study area or beach-face erosion
has worsened, and coarse-sediment input from upstream has not decreased, the Conservancy will respond with
site-specific adaptive management. The Conservancy will develop and implement an adaptive management plan
that will review and evaluate monitoring data and project conditions and recommend follow-up actions. Such
actions could include continued or revised monitoring, corrective actions or interventions, and documentation.
Significance after Mitigation: With implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.9-7 (Alt. 1) as described above, the
potential adverse geomorphic consequences of short-term interruption of coarse-sediment delivery would be less
than significant because the coarse sediment would be supplemented if necessary to prevent additional beach
erosion.

(Alt. 1)

Stormwater Drainage and Treatment. (CEQA 1, 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2, 3) Implementing Alternative 1 would
involve constructing permanent recreational features. The development of these features could potentially
result in the release of pollutants and degradation of water quality. As described in Environmental
Commitments 5, 6, and 11, effective permanent BMPs to protect water quality would be included in the final
design of all recreation features. This impact would be less than significant.

Alternative 1 would include several recreational features, including two kiosks, observation areas, trails at the
margins of the marsh, and a boardwalk across the northern end of the marsh. The facilities generally would be
restricted to the margins of the SEZ to minimize the extent of encroachment in this sensitive area. Developing
these features would require disturbance of floodplain areas within an SEZ, presenting potential erosion hazards.
Recreational facilities with impervious cover (e.g., the surfaces of bicycle paths) could also increase or
concentrate runoff and increase erosion potential.
The design of recreational features has not been finalized. Developing these features may increase the potential
for the transport of sediment or other pollutants to the Upper Truckee River and Lake Tahoe, which would be a
potentially significant effect. However, the Conservancy would implement ECs 5 and 6 (Table 2-6).
Implementing these environmental commitments would require implementation of effective construction site
management plans and compliance with federal and state permits and thus would minimize short-term
construction-related impacts. The final project design and implementation would include permanent stormwater
detention features or infiltration systems for runoff from areas of proposed impervious surfaces (see Impact 3.8-1
[Alt. 1] in Section 3.8, “Hydrology and Flooding,” for further discussion). The Conservancy would also
implement EC 11, “Incorporate Effective Permanent Stormwater Best Management Practices,” to provide
effective permanent BMPs for all recreation features. With implementation of ECs 5, 6, and 11, this impact would
be less than significant.

IMPACT
3.9-1
(Alt. 2)

Short-Term Risk of Surface Water and Groundwater Degradation During Construction. (CEQA 1, 2, 3;
TRPA 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) Implementing Alternative 2 would involve substantial construction activities along or in the
channel of the Upper Truckee River, sections of Trout Creek, along the Tahoe Keys Marina, and near the
shoreline of Lake Tahoe. Although temporary BMPs would be implemented, short-term risks of water quality
degradation could occur in each summer construction season or over the intervening winters. Grading would
result in ground disturbance within sensitive lands and increase the potential for erosion and sediment
transport. Accidental releases of hazardous materials or other pollutants could affect surface or subsurface
waters. Implementing Alternative 2 could result in short-term turbidity potentially impairing noncontact
recreation beneficial uses (aesthetics). Although the Conservancy would implement Environmental
Commitments 5 and 6, this impact would be significant.

Construction activities under Alternative 2 would include large-scale grading operations and construction of
permanent facilities during multiple construction seasons. These activities pose a similar range and magnitude of
possible impacts, under the same permit conditions, and within the same conceptual level of BMPs and design
certainty as discussed for Impact 3.9-1 (Alt. 1). Despite efforts to minimize risks, the effects could result in a the
turbidity standard described in Section 5.2 of the Basin Plan. For purposes of this analysis, any violation of any
duration and magnitude would be potentially significant.
The Conservancy would implement ECs 5 and 6 (Table 2-6). These measures would prevent surface-water and/or
groundwater degradation that could be of sufficient magnitude and duration to impair the Upper Truckee River’s
beneficial uses, including visible turbidity that could impair aesthetic values or affect other beneficial uses.
Impairment of beneficial uses would likely require considerably higher turbidity levels, orders of magnitude
above the river’s very low background levels. However, as mentioned previously for Impact 3.9-1 (Alt. 1), the

significance conclusion for this environmental document is based on the potential to violate the Basin Plan’s
turbidity standard. Therefore, this impact would be significant.
All feasible measures to avoid, minimize, or mitigate this impact have already been incorporated into the design of
Alternative 2. However, these measures would not be sufficient to fully mitigate the potential for at least short-term
violations of the Basin Plan’s stringent water quality standard for turbidity. Because the potential to exceed this
stringent standard would remain, this impact would be significant and unavoidable.
IMPACT
3.9-2
(Alt. 2)

Short-Term, Project-Related Risk of Surface Water Degradation Following Construction. (CEQA 1, 2, 3;
TRPA 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) Implementing Alternative 2 would require completion of in-channel construction activities.
The biotechnical streambank treatments and other revegetated areas, such as the backfilled channel
segments and inset floodplains, could be vulnerable during a flood flow within the first few years following
construction. Therefore, implementing Alternative 2 could result in short-term exceedance of the Basin Plan’s
stringent turbidity standard (ten percent above background levels) after the construction phase. This impact
would be significant.

Possible risks from natural channel adjustment effects (described further under Impact 3.9-2 [Alt. 1]) would be
minimal under Alternative 2. The final channel size, shape, and bed and bank materials would be installed during
construction and would be allowed to season and establish before the release of live stream flows, and natural
channel adjustments would not be needed to meet final design grade or functions.
Under Alternative 2, the new, geomorphically sized channel constructed between RS 20+00 and the mouth of the
Upper Truckee River and the small areas of inset floodplain in the upstream portion of the study area would be
relatively susceptible to erosion (compared to the well-established, undisturbed vegetated surfaces) if a large flood
were to occur within the first few years after construction. A slightly increased risk of sediment mobilization may
occur if a major flood event were to occur before the vegetation could mature.
Design and revegetation specifications would be implemented for all reactivated channels and floodplain areas
with remnant channels to minimize the risk that accumulated fine sediments and/or organic materials would be
mobilized during a large flood in the first few years after construction. Despite these efforts to minimize risks, the
effects could cause a violation of Section 5.2 of the Basin Plan (i.e., the stringent turbidity standard of ten percent
above background levels). This impact would be significant.
Mitigation Measure 3.9-2 (Alt. 2): Adaptively Manage Potential Flood Disturbance in the Interim Period after
Construction.
This mitigation measure is identical to Mitigation Measure 3.9-2 (Alt. 1).
Significance after Mitigation: With implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.9-2 (Alt. 2) as described above, the
short-term risk of surface-water or groundwater degradation following construction would be minimized, because
potential flood damage in the interim period after construction would be adaptively managed. However, the
potential for at least short-term violations of the Basin Plan’s stringent water quality standard for turbidity cannot
be feasibly eliminated. Because of the potential to exceed this stringent standard, Impact 3.9-2 (Alt. 2) would be
significant and unavoidable.
IMPACT
3.9-3
(Alt. 2)

Upper Truckee River Channel Erosion within the Study Area. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 2 would
involve making direct changes to the channel of the Upper Truckee River. The changes would offset past
geomorphic responses to historic disturbances by reconstructing more appropriately sized channel sections
with better connectivity to the existing floodplain and constructing features to prevent streambank erosion. This
would result in a substantial long-term benefit by improving channel stability and reducing erosion of the
channel bed and banks. This impact would be beneficial.

Geomorphology and Water Quality

Alternative 2 would involve constructing a new, more geomorphically stable channel for the Upper Truckee River
between RS 20+00 and RS 10+700 (Exhibit 2-2). The proposed channel has been designed to improve channel
stability and to promote more natural interaction of the river with its floodplain and relocate the mouth of the
river. The new channel would increase the length of channel that is “geomorphically sized” from approximately
500 feet under existing conditions to 6,150 feet. The proposed improvements in channel morphology would
promote a more stable channel, reducing the potential for lateral and vertical erosion. The alternative also
proposes the construction of bank stabilization and new floodplain areas downstream of the U.S. 50 bridge
(RS 0+00 to RS 20+00) to reduce existing bank erosion. These improvements are specifically proposed to
minimize the potential for future erosion and sediment transport from the study area (and to Lake Tahoe).
In addition to these features, Alternative 2 proposes installation of a vertical grade control just downstream of the
confluence of the river with Trout Creek. This structure would reduce the potential for upstream migration of a
knickpoint in the Upper Truckee River that might develop in the future in response to sustained periods of low
lake levels.
Compilation of the TMDL streambank-erosion results (California Water Boards and NDEP 2008) for specific
subreaches of the Upper Truckee River allows a quantitative estimate of the effect of the proposed alternatives on
stream channel erosion (Table 3.9-13). Using the range of treatment tiers analyzed for the TMDL, the estimated
reduction in fine sediment loads from streambank erosion in the study area under Alternative 2 would be nearly
60 percent (reduced to 221 cubic yards from 538 cubic yards under existing conditions and the No-Project/NoAction Alternative). The study area is a small portion of the entire 15-mile-long river, and the proposed action
alternatives alone would reduce the entire Upper Truckee River’s fine sediment load from streambanks by about
1 percent relative to existing conditions. While small, this would be a considerable and measurable benefit
relative to the degraded existing condition or the No-Project/No-Action Alternative.

Alternative 2 proposes the same changes as Alternative 1 to the channel and overbank morphology, which may
alter the hydraulics of the Upper Truckee River channel downstream of the U.S. 50 bridge, and the same bank
stabilization. These features would generally improve channel stability downstream of the bridge and may help
prevent future adverse effects on bridge stability.
This impact addresses long-term benefits associated with a net reduction of erosion. However, all stream
restoration projects, particularly those that incorporate geomorphic process–based adjustments as part of the
design elements, may experience localized channel erosion during an interim period following construction. The
potential adverse water quality impacts of such adjustments (including unexpected changes or responses to flood
disturbance) were described as a significant short-term impact above in Impact 3.9-2 (Alt. 2). The mitigation for
that impact, Mitigation Measure 3.9-2 (Alt. 2), requires implementation of an adaptive management plan that
commits to actions that would prevent short-term water quality problems from becoming chronic, thus ensuring
that the long-term improvements to Upper Truckee River conditions expected under Impact 3.9-3 (Alt. 2) can be
realized. This impact would be beneficial.

3.9-4
(Alt. 2)

Trout Creek Channel Erosion within the Study Area. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 2 would not involve
directly modifying the channel of Trout Creek. However, Trout Creek would be expected to adjust to the
proposed changes to the elevation and size of the Upper Truckee River channel in the vicinity of the mouth of
the creek. The anticipated response of Trout Creek would likely be deposition in the lowest reach, reducing the
potential for continued incision that previously was prompted by historical dredging and lowering of the Upper
Truckee River Channel bed. This impact would be beneficial.

Under Alternative 2, the channel of the Upper Truckee River through the marsh (Reach 3) would be modified by
abandoning the existing straightened segment and constructing a new meandering channel (Exhibit 2-2). The new
river channel would be narrower and its bed would be raised compared to the existing channel. Although the
effect of raising the river’s elevation may be to initiate deposition at the confluence and within the lower reach of
the creek, the change would also reduce the potential for continued incision (vertical erosion) of the river. Raising
the bed of the river would also reduce the potential for future incision of the creek channel. Overall, modifying the
Upper Truckee River channel would either have a neutral effect or reduce the potential for erosion within Trout
Creek.
No quantitative estimate of streambank erosion loads or load reduction potential along Trout Creek was made in
studies for the TMDL (California Water Boards and NDEP 2008). However, based on geomorphic principles and
qualitative analysis, Alternative 1 would not substantially change the amount of flow (and sediment) carried by
Trout Creek’s main channel and distributaries under normal or flood conditions. Although the modifications at the
mouth may promote some localized deposition, the low-gradient environment of the lower reach of the creek
would not be expected to be subject to substantial changes in lateral or vertical erosion. The effect on lower Trout
Creek would be slightly beneficial relative to existing conditions.
As described above for the Upper Truckee River (Impact 3.9-3 [Alt. 2]), implementing mitigation to prevent
adverse short-term water quality impacts from becoming chronic conditions (Mitigation Measure 3.9-2 [Alt. 2])
would ensure that the long-term improvements to Trout Creek conditions expected under Impact 3.9-4 (Alt. 2)
can be realized. This impact would be beneficial.
IMPACT
3.9-5
(Alt. 2)

Erosion of Backfilled and/or Remnant Channel Segments on the Floodplain. (CEQA 1, 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2,
3) Implementing Alternative 2 would involve backfilling portions of the existing Upper Truckee River to function
as part of the active floodplain, and would increase the frequency with which existing remnant channel
segments on the floodplain would be inundated. Following the project design details and specifications would
prevent “recapture” of the backfilled channel or an increase in erosive force on remnant channel segments that
could mobilize accumulated sediment and organic matter. This impact would be less than significant.

Alternative 2 may incrementally increase the exposure of existing remnant (i.e., naturally abandoned) channel
segments on the floodplain to flood flows. The remnant channels are discontinuous, curved depressions on the
marsh surface that are partially filled with fine sediment and accumulated organic material. Alternative 2 would
increase the area inundated during low-magnitude, high-frequency flow events (i.e., two-year and five-year
flows), but would not substantially alter inundation in the area during high magnitude events (i.e., 25-year flows
or greater). The increased inundation from small floods might raise the potential for flow to enter remnant channel
segments and possibly erode them more often, but these areas would be subject to erosion from larger floods
under existing conditions. The portion of the study area that would experience increased overbank inundation
under Alternative 2 includes an abandoned ditch east of the river and the upstream portion of a remnant channel.
Flow in the ditch would be expected to return to the river, but the remnant channel would not discharge to the
river or Trout Creek except under major flood flows. Potential erosion of the ditch caused by improved
overbanking under Alternative 2 could increase transport of sediment and nutrients to the river and lake during
small to moderate events rather than just under large, less frequent events. The change would relate to long-term
timing and not to the total magnitude; therefore, this would not be a substantial effect.

Alternative 2 also would abandon existing channel segments between RS 20+00 and RS 107+00 (about 8,700
feet). The abandoned channels would be filled with floodplain sediments generated by construction of new
channel segments, existing stockpiled sediments, and imported sediments (if necessary). Lateral grade controls
would be installed upstream and downstream of the proposed intersections of backfilled abandoned channels with
the newly constructed channel segments. The lateral controls would be designed to resist erosion of the backfilled
channel in that vicinity at forces up to the 100-year flood event.
Following the project’s proposed specifications for backfill areas would prevent uneven placement of backfill,
differential compaction, or varied success of revegetation, which induce erosion of either the backfill or adjacent
natural soil/sediment. Potential erosion along the backfilled abandoned channel segments would be avoided. This
impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.9-6
(Alt. 2)

Retention of Fine Sediment and Nutrients within the Study Area. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 2
would directly reduce the Upper Truckee River’s channel capacity and raise the streambed elevation
throughout much of the study area, make modifications that would reduce streambank height in other
subreaches, and restore lagoon features along the river and behind East Barton Beach. These modifications
would increase the frequency of overbanking, enlarge the area of functional active floodplain, and offset past
geomorphic adjustments to historic disturbances. Overtopping of the banks during small to moderate flood
peaks would result in a substantial improvement in fine sediment and nutrient retention on the floodplain (i.e.,
marsh surface). This effect would be beneficial.

Alternative 2 proposes a channel design that would reduce the Upper Truckee River’s channel capacity and/or
bank heights relative to the floodplain surface to reestablish overbanking and expand the area of active floodplain
that receives flow during small events (e.g., the 2- to 5-year-magnitude storms). With implementation of
Alternative 2, the length of channel experiencing overbanking during the two-year flow (at median lake levels)
would increase from approximately 2,129 feet under existing conditions to about 16,345 feet (about 79 percent of
the new channel) (Table 3.9-14). The expected area of inundation during such an event would increase from about
65 to 126 acres under Alternative 2.

The increased frequency and area of inundation during relatively frequent flow events would promote the
retention of fine-grained sediment on portions of the floodplain that are not inundated as frequently under existing
conditions. During an overtopping event, streamflow would spread over a wider area, resulting in decreased flow
velocity and depth. These hydraulic conditions would favor the retention of sediment particles transported by the
storm flows. The retention of sediment and associated nutrients, including phosphorous and nitrogen, on the
floodplain would enhance nutrient delivery to marsh soils and vegetation. Additionally, infiltration of water in
inundated areas would increase soil moisture and would recharge (and temporarily raise) shallow groundwater.
The increased nutrient delivery and increased available water in the shallow subsurface would improve conditions

for riparian and marsh vegetation. The magnitude of these benefits would vary depending on the timing and
duration of inundation.
Alternative 2 would involve removing fill and grading the west streambank of the Upper Truckee River to
reconnect the existing Sailing Lagoon to the river, while isolating it from the dredged marina. Restoration of the
surface water connection with the river would increase the opportunity for overbank flows to convey sediment
and nutrients into the lagoon. Increased sediment retention and nutrient cycling relative to the existing condition is
an additional benefit beyond active floodplain inundation.
Alternative 2 would also include removal of fill behind (landward of) East Barton Beach to recreate lagoon and
wet meadow conditions. These modifications would also increase the areas along the floodplain margin to capture
sediment and nutrients.
The combined effects of creating more stable channel segments, promoting more frequent overtopping events and
sediment retention on the floodplain, implementing bank protection, and creating/improving functioning lagoon
and wetland environments under Alternative 2 would help to reduce transport of fine sediment to Lake Tahoe.
The proposed reduction of the river mouth’s capacity and raising of its elevation and the retention of sediment
would return long-term littoral processes at the river-lake interface to a more natural regime. This effect would be
beneficial.
IMPACT

(Alt. 2)

Decreased Delivery of Coarse Sediment to Cove East and Barton Beaches. (TRPA 2) Implementing
Alternative 2 could result in a net decrease in the transport of coarse sediment by the Upper Truckee River to
beach areas adjacent to its mouth. The reduction in coarse-sediment delivery could hinder beach
replenishment and worsen the ongoing trend of net beach erosion. In the long term, climate change effects
could either exacerbate or counteract present trends; potential effects could range from worse than the existing
degraded condition to a possible improvement. Any determination regarding long-term effects of climate
change on coarse-sediment transport and delivery downstream would be too speculative for a meaningful
conclusion. In the short term, however, implementing Alternative 2 would directly modify transport of coarse
sediment and foster deposition within various portions of the study area, which may temporarily decrease
delivery of coarse sediment to the adjacent beaches. This short-term impact would be less than significant.

Under Alternative 2, the Upper Truckee River would be modified to develop a more stable channel and to
improve the natural interaction of the river with its floodplain and marsh environments. A goal of the design of
Alternative 2 is to design and construct a channel that would minimize channel instability (particularly incision)
and efficiently convey flows and related sediment load. The design would include raising the channel bed and
installing two vertical grade control structures. The structures would reduce the potential for erosion and transport
(i.e., remobilization) of marsh/floodplain sediments, including some coarse sediment. A continuous low-flow
channel would be created and would not require aggradation to reach its design elevation.
Alternative 2 would involve connecting the river to the Sailing Lagoon (at high flows) and modifying the marsh
landward of East Barton Beach providing increased potential for deposition and storage of coarse sediment
transported by the river. If not controlled, the overflow of river flows into the Sailing Lagoon could result in a
permanent connection of the river to the lagoon (see discussion in Impact 3.9-5 [Alt. 1]) and the potential for
transporting coarse sediment into the lagoon during more frequent flows. Final project design would include a flow
control feature to manage water flowing into the Sailing Lagoon during bank overtopping events when the lagoon’s
starting water surface would be low. The control feature (e.g., a rock-lined channel or weir structure) would be
designed to control the location and minimum elevation of overflow into the lagoon. It would prevent the
development of a permanent, uncontrolled erosion channel connecting the river to the lagoon at low flows.
However, as under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, potentially offsetting factors may result from climate
change in the long term. The net effect on downstream river dynamics and beach erosion is highly uncertain. Even

after thorough investigation, any determination regarding climate change effects on coarse-sediment transport and
delivery downstream would be speculative.
Regardless of uncertainty about long-term effects of climate change, Alternative 2 has the potential to temporarily
decrease the delivery of coarse sediment to Lake Tahoe relative to existing conditions. However, the design elements
of Alternative 2 include a low-flow channel that would be complete at the time of construction, and none of the
features would require aggradation to meet the finished grade or function. Therefore, any temporary reduction in
sediment delivery would be expected to be minor. Sediment transport and coarse sediment input to the littoral zone
would continue.
This short-term impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT

(Alt. 2)

Stormwater Drainage and Treatment. (CEQA 1, 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2, 3) Implementing Alternative 2 would
involve incorporating site-specific measures along the margins of the study area to provide additional
stormwater pretreatment and/or flow routing improvements to enhance water quality treatment before
discharge to the SEZ or directly to the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek in the study area. Implementing
these measures would improve conditions and help to reduce the amount of urban pollutants discharged to
surface waters. However, this alternative would also involve constructing permanent recreational facilities. The
development of these facilities could potentially result in degradation of water quality. As described in
Environmental Commitments 5, 6, and 11, effective permanent BMPs to protect water quality would be
included in the final design of all recreation features. This impact would be less than significant.

Implementing Alternative 2 would involve incorporating site-specific measures along the margins of the study
area to provide additional stormwater treatment and/or flow routing improvements to enhance water quality
treatment before discharge within the SEZ or directly to the surface water in the Upper Truckee River and Trout
Creek. This would be beneficial relative to the no-project future. Alternative 2 would provide treatment areas for
urban stormwater runoff flowing into the study area from developed areas to the west. Specifically, the alternative
would include two “stormwater treatment areas” near the western margin of the site: one area at the existing storm
drain outfall from Colorado Court, the second in the area east of East Venice Drive. The alternative designates
areas to be available for the treatment of stormwater, but does not specify the method or type of treatment. The
areas appear sufficiently large to accommodate a range of typical and effective urban runoff treatment options:
vegetated swales, infiltration trenches or basins, wet ponds or extended detention basins, or some combination of
options. These areas provide for stormwater quality treatment before discharge within the SEZ and/or directly to
the surface water in the Upper Truckee River. The opportunity to provide treatment of runoff would be an
improvement relative to existing conditions.
Alternative 2 proposes limited permanent public access, recreation, and habitat protection elements: a pedestrian
trail extending from East Venice Drive to the Sailing Lagoon (with a new fishing platform) and Cove East Beach
(with a viewpoint), and viewpoint areas along the eastern margin of the study area. The facilities generally would
be restricted to the margins of the SEZ to minimize the extent of encroachment in this sensitive area. Developing
these features would require disturbance of floodplain areas within an SEZ, presenting potential erosion hazards.
Recreational facilities with impervious cover (e.g., pavements and other structures) could also increase or
concentrate runoff and increase erosion potential.
The design of these features has not been finalized. However, without proper mitigation of their effects, these
features may increase the potential for the transport of sediment or other pollutants to surface water bodies, which
would be a potentially significant effect. However, the Conservancy would implement ECs 5 and 6 (Table 2-6).
Implementing these environmental commitments would require implementation of effective construction site
management plans and compliance with federal and state permits and thus would minimize short-term
construction-related impacts. The final project design and implementation would include permanent stormwater
detention features or infiltration systems for runoff from areas of proposed impervious surfaces (see Impact 3.8-1
[Alt. 2] in Section 3.8, “Hydrology and Flooding,” for further discussion). The Conservancy would also

Short-Term Risk of Surface Water and Groundwater Degradation During Construction. (CEQA 1, 2, 3;
TRPA 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) Implementing Alternative 3 would involve substantial construction activities along or in the
channel of the Upper Truckee River, along the Tahoe Keys Marina, and near the shoreline of Lake Tahoe.
Although temporary BMPs would be implemented, short-term risks of water quality degradation could occur in
each summer construction season or over the intervening winters. Grading would result in ground disturbance
within sensitive lands and increase the potential for erosion and sediment transport. Accidental releases of
hazardous materials or other pollutants could affect surface or subsurface waters. Implementing Alternative 3
could result in short-term turbidity exceeding the Basin Plan’s stringent turbidity standard (10 percent above
background levels). Although the Conservancy would implement Environmental Commitments 5 and 6, this
impact would be significant.

Construction activities under Alternative 3 would include large-scale grading operations and construction of
permanent facilities during multiple construction seasons. These activities pose a similar range and magnitude of
possible impacts, under the same permit conditions, and within the same conceptual level of BMPs and design
certainty as discussed for Impact 3.9-7 (Alt. 1). The Conservancy would implement ECs 5 and 6 (Table 2-6) to
minimize the likelihood and potential magnitude of short-term water quality degradation that could persist. These
protective measures would be expected to avoid adverse effects on beneficial uses. However, this impact would
be significant.
All feasible measures to avoid, minimize, or mitigate this impact have already been incorporated into the design of
Alternative 3. However, these measures would not be sufficient to fully mitigate the potential for at least short-term
violations of the Basin Plan’s stringent water quality standard for turbidity. Because the potential to exceed this
stringent standard would remain, Impact 3.9-1 (Alt. 3) would be significant and unavoidable.

(Alt. 3)

Short-Term, Project-Related Risk of Surface Water Degradation Following Construction. (CEQA 1, 2, 3;
TRPA 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) Implementing Alternative 3 would require completion of in-channel construction activities.
The biotechnical streambank treatments and other revegetated areas, such as the backfilled channel
segments, could expose areas of existing remnant channels to vulnerability during a flood flow within the first
few years following construction. Additionally, Alternative 3 expects natural geomorphic erosion processes to
reestablish one or more Upper Truckee River low-flow or overflow channels within the main marsh after
construction of the pilot channel. Therefore, implementing Alternative 3 could result in short-term exceedance
of the Basin Plan’s stringent turbidity standard (ten percent above background levels) after the construction
phase. This impact would be significant.

Possible risks from natural channel adjustment effects (described further under Impact 3.9-2 [Alt. 1]) could be
substantial under Alternative 3.The final location, size, and shape of newly formed channels and the bed and bank
materials downstream of the pilot channel would not be controlled by design or construction; rather they would be
established by natural geomorphic processes. Although the processes would be natural, the potential magnitude
and severity of short-term channel dynamics would be greater under Alternative 3 than under the other action
alternatives.
The existing main marsh has numerous remnant channel features of irregular width and depth, many of which
have accumulated fine sediment and organics. It is not possible to accurately predict which or how many remnant
channel segments would be activated by natural geomorphic processes after construction. However, historic aerial
photos and existing topography suggest at least one moderately prominent abandoned channel that intersects the
existing Trout Creek between RS 70+00 and RS 80+00 (on Trout Creek). Formation of one or more new Upper

Truckee River channels within the central portion of the marsh could erode existing sediment and organic
material. A rough estimate (based on existing topographic data) suggests that 34,815 cubic yards of material could
be mobilized if a single channel were to form with a length of about 4,700 feet and a cross-section area similar to
the “geomorphically sized” design channel (about 200 square feet).
Disturbed and revegetated areas present under Alternative 3, such as inset floodplains, the pilot channel, and
Sailing Lagoon margins, would be similar to those in Alternatives 1 and 2. These areas would be relatively
susceptible to erosion (compared to the well-established, undisturbed vegetated surfaces) if a large flood were to
occur within the first few years after construction. Design and revegetation specifications would be implemented
for all reactivated channels and floodplain areas with remnant channels to minimize the risk that accumulated fine
sediments and/or organic materials would be mobilized during a large flood in the first few years after
construction. Although some of the material may be removed in advance or redeposited on the surrounding
floodplain, some material could be transported to Lake Tahoe. Given the strict turbidity standard included in
Section 5.2 of the Basin Plan (ten percent above background levels), this standard could be violated even if the
channel adjustments were to occur during large streamflow events with high background turbidity. This impact
would be significant.
Mitigation Measure 3.9-2 (Alt. 3): Adaptively Manage Potential Flood Disturbance in the Interim Period after
Construction.
This mitigation measure is identical to Mitigation Measure 3.9-2 (Alt. 1).
Significance after Mitigation: With implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.9-2 (Alt. 3) as described above, the
short-term risk of surface-water or groundwater degradation following construction would be minimized, because
potential flood damage in the interim period after construction would be adaptively managed. However, the
potential for at least short-term violations of the Basin Plan’s stringent water quality standard for turbidity cannot
be feasibly eliminated. Because of the potential to exceed this stringent standard, Impact 3.9-2 (Alt. 3) would be
significant and unavoidable.
IMPACT
3.9-3
(Alt. 3)

Upper Truckee River Channel Erosion within the Study Area. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 3 would
involve making direct changes to the channel of the Upper Truckee River and redirect its flow to the center of
the marsh via a constructed ”pilot” channel. The flow would not be directed or controlled downstream of the
pilot channel, and natural geomorphic processes would be allowed to form one or more new river channels
over time. The changes would offset past geomorphic response to historic disturbances by allowing the river to
reestablish channels on the existing floodplain surface. The long-term effects would be beneficial relative to the
existing degraded channel condition. This impact would be beneficial.

Under Alternative 3, the low-flow channel of the Upper Truckee River would be relocated eastward to promote
the development of a main channel and/or distributary channels in the central portion of the Upper Truckee Marsh
(Exhibit 2-3). A new channel would be built (beginning at RS 17+00) to redirect flow to the east of the existing
channel. The constructed “pilot” channel would be approximately 3,300 feet long and would be designed
similarly to the “geomorphically sized” channels proposed in Alternatives 1 and 2. The banks and bed of the
channel would be stabilized with vegetation and a sand and gravel fill. At its northern end, the pilot channel
would terminate in a flared energy-dissipation structure. From this point, the flow would be uncontrolled and
allowed to seek a preferred drainage path. The flow would likely form one or more meandering channels, possibly
reoccupying existing remnant channel segments. The newly formed channels would be expected to connect with
the existing lower reach of Trout Creek and flow out of the marsh through the existing mouth of the combined
Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek channel. Vertical grade control structures and bank stabilization would be
built into the lower reaches of the system.

Like Alternatives 1 and 2, Alternative 3 would provide bank protection for actively eroding banks downstream of
the U.S. 50 bridge and reconnect the Sailing Lagoon to the Upper Truckee River floodplain during high-flow
events.
Alternative 3 would include installation of a vertical grade control upstream of the mouth of the Upper Truckee
River near the beach ridge (RS 99+00). The grade control would reconstruct the streambed elevation and
conditions to be similar to those that likely existed before historic dredging. The vertical grade control would
reduce the potential for downcutting of the Upper Truckee River channel (and Trout Creek) during any future
periods of sustained low lake levels.
Compilation of the TMDL streambank-erosion results (California Water Boards and NDEP 2008) for specific
subreaches of the Upper Truckee River allows a quantitative estimate of the effect of the proposed alternatives on
stream channel erosion (Table 3.9-15). Using the range of treatment tiers analyzed for the TMDL, the estimated
reduction in fine sediment loads from streambank erosion in the study area under Alternative 3 would be nearly
59 percent (reduced to 221 cubic yards from 538 cubic yards under existing conditions and the No-Project/NoAction Alternative). The study area is a small portion of the entire 15-mile-long river, and the proposed action
alternatives alone would reduce the entire Upper Truckee River’s fine sediment load from streambanks by about
1 percent relative to existing conditions. While small, this would be a considerable and measurable benefit
relative to the degraded existing condition or the No-Project/No-Action Alternative.

Potential Upper Truckee River channel erosion during the interim period after construction is discussed above
under Impact 3.9-2 (Alt. 3).
Alternative 3 proposes the same changes as Alternatives 1 and 2 to the channel and overbank morphology, which
may alter the hydraulics of the Upper Truckee River channel downstream of the U.S. 50 bridge, and the same
bank stabilization. In addition, under this alternative, two arched corrugated-metal pipes would be installed under
U.S. 50 (west of the bridge, through the roadfill) to allow a portion of flood flows to bypass the bridge and flow
onto a inset floodplain downstream during high-flow conditions. The bypass flow would reduce hydraulic
pressure on the bridge for flow levels above 6,233 feet NGVD at the bridge. These improvements would generally
improve channel stability downstream of the bridge and would not result in adverse effects on bridge stability.
This impact addresses long-term benefits associated with a net reduction of erosion. However, all stream
restoration projects, particularly those that incorporate geomorphic process–based adjustments as part of the
design elements, may experience localized channel erosion during an interim period following construction. The
potential adverse water quality impacts of such adjustments (including unexpected changes or responses to flood
disturbance) were described as a significant short-term impact above in Impact 3.9-2 (Alt. 3). The mitigation for
that impact, Mitigation Measure 3.9-2 (Alt. 3), requires implementation of an adaptive management plan that
commits to actions that would prevent short-term water quality problems from becoming chronic, thus ensuring

that the long-term improvements to Upper Truckee River conditions expected under Impact 3.9-3 (Alt. 3) can be
realized. This impact would be beneficial.
IMPACT
3.9-4
(Alt. 3)

Trout Creek Channel Erosion within the Study Area. (CEQA 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2, 3) Implementing Alternative 3
would involve modifying the hydrology and geomorphic processes in the lower reach of Trout Creek. Additional
streamflow and sediment would be conveyed to lower Trout Creek from the channel(s) of the Upper Truckee
River downstream of the constructed pilot channel. The future confluence of the Upper Truckee River and
Trout Creek would not be constructed but would form through natural geomorphic response to the construction
of the pilot channel, and it would likely be located upstream of the existing confluence. The changes in flow,
sediment loads, and confluence location could worsen ongoing streambed incision in the lower reach of Trout
Creek or extend channel instability upstream, or both. However, stabilization of the streambed and streambank
along the lower 2,600 feet of Trout Creek would be provided to prevent this potential response. This impact
would be less than significant.

No quantitative estimate of streambank erosion loads or load reduction potential along Trout Creek was made in
studies for the TMDL (California Water Boards and NDEP 2008). However, based on geomorphic principles and
qualitative analysis, Alternative 3 would be expected to have the following varied effects on erosion of the Trout
Creek channel within the study area.
Alternative 3 could create unstable conditions within the Trout Creek channel that could result in adverse erosion
of the creek’s bed or banks. Directing the flow of the Upper Truckee River into the center of the marsh would
convey the flows into the existing Trout Creek channel. This would likely destabilize the segment of Trout Creek
downstream of the newly formed confluence with the river (a possible location would be near RS 78+00 on Trout
Creek). The increase in flows conveyed by this creek segment would result in erosion of the bed and/or banks.
The assumed intersection of the new Upper Truckee River channel and Trout Creek would move the confluence
approximately 1,700 feet upstream (along Trout Creek) from the present location. The effect would be to shorten
the overall length of Trout Creek. Assuming that the bed at the confluence would be controlled by the river
channel, the gradient of Trout Creek would be expected to steepen, possibly resulting in lateral or vertical erosion
in Trout Creek. Such erosion would also increase the amount of sediment transported through the combined
Upper Truckee River/Trout Creek system.
In anticipation of some of these changes, the final project design for Alternative 3 would involve stabilizing the
Upper Truckee River’s streambed elevation downstream of the existing confluence of the river and Trout Creek.
In addition, vertical grade controls and streambank stabilization measures would be designed based on the
combined peak flows of the creek and river. These grade controls and stabilization measures would be
incorporated along about 2,600 feet of lower Trout Creek (RS 66+00 to RS 95+00). The vertical grade controls
would be adequate to maintain the channel’s existing average slope and elevation and remain stable under 100­
year peak flows. The streambank stabilization measures would be designed to remain stable under 25-year peak
flows.
As described above for the Upper Truckee River (Impact 3.9-3 [Alt. 3]), implementing mitigation to prevent
adverse short-term water quality impacts from becoming chronic (Mitigation Measure 3.9-2 [Alt. 3]) would
protect Trout Creek from project-related erosion in the long term. This net impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.9-5
(Alt. 3)

Erosion of Backfilled and/or Remnant Channel Segments on the Floodplain. (CEQA 1, 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2,
3) Implementing Alternative 3 would involve backfilling portions of the existing Upper Truckee River to function
as part of the active floodplain. A full range of river flows would be redirected into areas of remnant channel
segments on the floodplain. Following the project design details and specifications would prevent “recapture” of
the backfilled channel or an increase in erosive force on remnant channel segments that could mobilize
accumulated sediment and organic matter. This impact would be less than significant.

Alternative 3 would increase the exposure of existing remnant (i.e., naturally abandoned) channel segments on the
floodplain to flood flows. The remnant channels are discontinuous, curved depressions on the marsh surface that
are partially filled with fine sediment and accumulated organic material. Alternative 3 would increase the area
inundated during low-magnitude, high-frequency flow events (i.e., two- and five-year flows). Because the main
flows of the Upper Truckee River would be directed to the central marsh, some characteristics of inundation could
also change during larger magnitude events (i.e., 25-year flows or greater).
Several partial remnant channels and at least one well-expressed remnant channel could potentially concentrate
overbank flows and initiate erosion of sediment and/or organic material. In the long term, increased inundation
might raise the potential for flows to enter remnant channel segments and possibly erode them more often;
however, these areas would be subject to erosion from larger floods under existing conditions. Potential erosion of
the remnant channel(s) by Alternative 3 could increase transport of sediment and nutrients to Trout Creek and
Lake Tahoe under small to moderate flood events, rather than just under large, less-frequent events. The change
would relate to long-term timing and not to the total magnitude; therefore, this would not be a substantial effect.
(Potential short-term erosion impacts of remnant channel segments within the middle of the marsh during the
interim period as the Upper Truckee River develops one or more channel[s] downstream of the pilot channel were
discussed separately in Impact 3.9-2 [Alt. 3].)
Alternative 3 also would abandon existing channel segments between RS 17+00 and RS 93+00 (about 7,600 feet).
The abandoned channels would be filled with floodplain sediments generated by construction of new channel
segments, existing stockpiled sediments, and imported sediments (if necessary). Lateral grade controls would be
installed upstream and downstream of intersections of the backfilled abandoned channels and the newly
constructed channel segments. The lateral controls would be designed to resist erosion of the backfilled channel in
that vicinity at forces up to the 100-year flood event.
Following the project’s proposed specifications for backfill areas would prevent uneven placement of backfill,
differential compaction, or varied success of revegetation, which induce erosion of either the backfill or adjacent
natural soil/sediment. Potential erosion along the backfilled abandoned channel segments would be avoided. This
impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.9-6
(Alt. 3)

Retention of Fine Sediment and Nutrients within the Study Area. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 3
would redirect the Upper Truckee River to the central portion of the Upper Truckee Marsh, thus allowing the
flow to spread in existing remnant channels and floodplain surfaces; make modifications to reduce streambank
height in upstream subreaches; and restore connection to the Sailing Lagoon during high flows. These
modifications would increase the frequency of overbanking, enlarge the area of functional active floodplain,
and offset past geomorphic adjustments to historic disturbances. Overtopping of the banks during small to
moderate flood peaks would result in a substantial improvement in fine sediment and nutrient retention on the
floodplain (i.e., marsh surface). This impact would be beneficial.

A major component of Alternative 3 is to redirect flow from the existing Upper Truckee River channel eastward
to the central portion of the marsh via a constructed “pilot” channel. The flow would then be allowed to flow
uncontrolled over the marsh surface. This condition is intended to mimic natural, uncontrolled conditions within
the distal end of marsh/delta environments. The effect would be to spread flows over a large area, decreasing flow
velocities and promoting the retention of sediments transported by the river. One or more channels would be
expected to develop within the marsh over time, but the location of the channel(s) cannot be accurately predicted.
The channel system could be dynamic and channel locations would be expected to change. Depending on
variations in flow and sediment load, a particular channel may fill and new channels may form by erosion. Given
the marsh’s low-gradient conditions, development of relatively deep and permanent channels is unlikely and
channel banks would be overtopped frequently (relative to existing conditions). The conditions would promote
increased retention of sediment and associated nutrients.

The net effect on water quality of the changes to channel length, channel capacity, bank elevations, and floodplain
topography proposed under Alternative 3 cannot be modeled; however, key parameters that would control the
potential for sediment retention have been determined (Table 3.9-16). Alternative 3 would reduce the river
channel’s capacity and/or bank heights relative to the floodplain surface to reestablish overbanking and expand
the area of active floodplain that receives flow during relatively small events (e.g., the two- to five-year­
magnitude storms). Overbanking during frequent small flood events would spread water across the active
floodplain at shallow depths. Shallow inundation on the irregular microtopography and through dense vegetation
on the floodplain would reduce velocities and encourage retention of suspended sediment. Indirect benefits to soil
moisture and groundwater recharge would also provide positive feedback by supporting vegetation that helps trap
sediment and take up nutrients. Hydraulic modeling has demonstrated that no increase in flow velocities and shear
stress within the Upper Truckee River would result from Alternative 3 under the five-year event (1,660 cfs)
(Conservancy and DGS 2005:4.1-5).
With implementation of Alternative 3, the length of channel experiencing overbanking during a two-year event
would increase from about 2,129 feet under existing conditions to about 17,000 feet (Table 3.9-16). The expected
area of inundation during such an event would increase from 65 to 156 acres under Alternative 3.

Alternative 3 would involve removing fill and grading the west streambank of the Upper Truckee River to
reconnect the existing Sailing Lagoon to the river, while isolating it from the dredged marina. Restoration of the
surface water connection with the river would increase the opportunity for overbank flows to convey sediment
and nutrients into the lagoon. Increased sediment retention and nutrient cycling relative to the existing condition is
an additional benefit beyond active floodplain inundation.
The combined long-term effects of increasing the number of stable channel segments, forming natural distributaries,
promoting more frequent overtopping events and sediment deposition on the floodplain, implementing bank
protection, and creating/improving functioning lagoon and wetland environments under Alternative 3 would help to
reduce transport of fine sediment to Lake Tahoe. Improved retention of sediment would return long-term littoral
processes at the river-lake interface to a more natural regime. That effect could include changing geographic patterns
as the mouths of the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek potentially experience shifts in magnitude and duration
as discharge points to the littoral zone. This impact would be beneficial.

(Alt. 3)

Decreased Delivery of Coarse Sediment to Cove East and Barton Beaches. (TRPA 2) Implementing
Alternative 3 could result in a net decrease in the transport of coarse sediment by the Upper Truckee River to
beach areas adjacent to its mouth. The reduction in coarse-sediment delivery could hinder beach
replenishment and worsen the ongoing trend of net beach erosion. In the long term, climate change effects
could either exacerbate or counteract present trends; potential effects could range from worse than the existing
degraded condition to a possible improvement. Any determination regarding long-term effects of climate
change on coarse-sediment transport and delivery downstream would be too speculative for a meaningful
conclusion. In the short term, however, implementing Alternative 3 would directly modify transport of coarse
sediment and foster deposition within various portions of the study area, which may temporarily decrease
delivery of coarse sediment to the adjacent beaches. This short-term impact would be potentially significant.

Implementing Alternative 3 would increase the potential for deposition and retention of coarse sediment within
the study area. It would enlarge the active floodplain and increase opportunities for deposition and net retention of
coarse sediment; potentially reactivate multiple thread distributary channels and increase opportunities for net
deposition; and reconnect and increase on-site lagoon areas that might receive river-overflow water and provide
net coarse-sediment retention. Implementing this alternative may interrupt all delivery of coarse sediment to the
mouth before establishment of one or more continuous low-flow channels. It also may reduce or interrupt coarsesediment delivery during below-normal runoff (and low-lake-level) conditions if flow and sediment could not
pass through potential small distributary channels and/or over the beach-ridge grade control.
Alternative 3 would involve connecting the Upper Truckee River to the Sailing Lagoon (at high flows), thus
increasing the potential for deposition and storage of coarse sediment transported by the river. If not controlled,
the overflow of river flows into the Sailing Lagoon could result in a permanent connection of the river to the
lagoon (see discussion in Impact 3.9-5 [Alt. 1]) and the potential for transporting coarse sediment into the lagoon
during more frequent flows. Final project design would include a flow control feature to manage water flowing
into the Sailing Lagoon during bank overtopping events when the lagoon’s starting water surface would be low.
The control feature (e.g., a rock-lined channel or weir structure) would be designed to control the location and
minimum elevation of overflow into the lagoon. It would prevent the development of a permanent, uncontrolled
erosion channel connecting the river to the lagoon at low flows.
However, as under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, potentially offsetting factors may result from climate
change in the long term. The net effect on downstream river dynamics and beach erosion is highly uncertain. Even
after thorough investigation, any determination regarding climate change effects on coarse-sediment transport and
delivery downstream would be speculative.
Regardless of uncertainty about long-term effects of climate change, Alternative 3 has the potential to temporarily
decrease the delivery of coarse sediment to Lake Tahoe relative to existing conditions. None of the design
elements or expected natural processes of Alternative 3 would require aggradation to meet the finished grade or
function. However, a temporary reduction in sediment delivery could occur because natural processes operating
within the marsh downstream of the constructed pilot channel may not immediately form continuous low-flow
channels to provide bedload-transport continuity all the way to the beach. The long-term effects on sediment
transport and input of coarse sediment to the littoral zone would restore a more natural regime.
This short-term impact would be potentially significant.
Mitigation Measure 3.9-7 (Alt. 3): Monitor and Adaptively Manage Delivery of Coarse Sediment to Cove East and
Barton Beaches.

Significance after Mitigation: With implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.9-7 (Alt. 3) as described above, the
potential adverse geomorphic effects and water quality consequences of short-term interruption of coarsesediment delivery would be less than significant because the coarse sediment would be supplemented if
necessary to prevent additional beach erosion.
IMPACT
3.9-8
(Alt. 3)

Stormwater Drainage and Treatment. (CEQA 1, 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2, 3) Implementing Alternative 3 would
involve incorporating site-specific measures along the margins of the study area to provide additional
stormwater pretreatment and/or flow routing improvements to enhance water quality treatment before
discharge to the SEZ. Implementing these measures would improve conditions and help to reduce the amount
of urban pollutants discharged to surface waters. However, this alternative would also involve constructing
permanent recreational facilities. The development of these facilities could potentially result in degradation of
water quality. As described in Environmental Commitments 5, 6, and 11, effective permanent BMPs to protect
water quality would be included in the final design of all recreation features. This impact would be less than
significant.

Like Alternative 2, Alternative 3 would provide treatment areas for urban stormwater runoff flowing into the
study area from developed areas to the west. Specifically, this alternative would include two “stormwater
treatment areas” near the western margin of the site: one area at the existing storm drain outfall from Colorado
Court, the second in the area east of East Venice Drive. The alternative designates areas to be available for the
treatment of stormwater, but does not specify the method or type of treatment. The areas appear sufficiently large
to accommodate a range of typical and effective urban runoff treatment options: vegetated swales, infiltration
trenches or basins, wet ponds or extended detention basins, or some combination of options. These areas provide
for stormwater quality treatment before discharge within the SEZ and/or directly to the surface water in the Upper
Truckee River. The opportunity to provide treatment of runoff would be an improvement relative to existing
conditions.
Alternative 3 also proposes new, permanent recreational facilities within the study area, including a self-service
kiosk on the west margin adjacent to East Venice Drive and a trail connecting these facilities to a fishing platform
on the Sailing Lagoon. Additionally, the alternative proposes viewpoints and a trail along the eastern margin and a
bike path and pedestrian trail north of Springwood Drive. The facilities generally would be restricted to the
margins of the SEZ to minimize the extent of encroachment in this sensitive area. Developing these features
would require disturbance of floodplain areas within an SEZ, presenting potential erosion hazards. Recreational
facilities with impervious cover (e.g., roofs and other structures) could also increase or concentrate runoff and
increase erosion potential.
The design of these features has not been finalized. However, without proper mitigation of the effects, these
features may increase the potential for the transport of sediment or other pollutants to surface water bodies, which
would be a potentially significant effect. However, the Conservancy would implement ECs 5 and 6 (Table 2-6).
Implementing these environmental commitments would require implementation of effective construction site
management plans and compliance with federal and state permits and thus would minimize short-term
construction-related impacts. The final project design and implementation would include permanent stormwater
detention features or infiltration systems for runoff from areas of proposed impervious surfaces (see Impact 3.8-1
[Alt. 3] in Section 3.8, “Hydrology and Flooding,” for further discussion). The Conservancy would also
implement EC 11 to provide effective permanent BMPs for all recreation features. With implementation of ECs 5,
6, and 11, this impact would be less than significant.

IMPACT
3.9-1
(Alt. 4)

Short-Term Risk of Surface Water and Groundwater Degradation During Construction. (CEQA 1, 2, 3;
TRPA 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) Implementing Alternative 4 would involve substantial construction activities along or in the
channel of the Upper Truckee River and near the shoreline of Lake Tahoe. Although temporary BMPs would
be implemented, short-term risks of water quality degradation could occur in each summer construction season
or over the intervening winters. Grading would result in ground disturbance within sensitive lands and increase
the potential for erosion and sediment transport. Accidental releases of hazardous materials or other pollutants
could affect surface or subsurface waters. Implementing Alternative 4 could result in short-term turbidity,
potentially impairing noncontact recreation beneficial uses (aesthetics). Although the Conservancy would
implement Environmental Commitments 5 and 6, this impact would be significant.

Construction activities under Alternative 4 would include large-scale grading operations and construction of
permanent facilities during multiple construction seasons. These activities pose a similar range and magnitude of
possible impacts, under the same permit conditions, and within the same conceptual level of BMPs and design
certainty as discussed for Impact 3.9-1 (Alt. 1). However, constructing an “inset” floodplain would require work
immediately adjacent to the low-flow channel and would not allow the revegetated areas to be isolated from
potential high flows. Final design materials, methods, and revegetation specifications would anticipate this
challenge and use the most effective means to create surfaces that would be stable immediately upon installation.
The Conservancy would implement ECs 5 and 6 (Table 2-6). Because effective site management plans would be
prepared and implemented, the likelihood and potential magnitude of short-term water quality degradation that could
persist would be minimized. These protective measures would be expected to avoid adverse effects on beneficial
uses. However, this impact would be significant.
All feasible measures to avoid, minimize, or mitigate this impact have already been incorporated into the design of
Alternative 4. However, these measures would not be sufficient to fully mitigate the potential for at least short-term
violations of the Basin Plan’s stringent water quality standard for turbidity. Because the potential to exceed this
stringent standard would remain, this impact would be significant and unavoidable.
IMPACT
3.9-2
(Alt. 4)

Short-Term, Project-Related Risk of Surface Water Degradation Following Construction. (CEQA 1, 2, 3;
TRPA 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) Implementing Alternative 4 would require completion of in-channel construction activities.
The biotechnical streambank treatments and other revegetated areas, such as the inset floodplain, could be
vulnerable during a flood flow within the first few years following construction. Therefore, implementing
Alternative 4 could result in potential short-term exceedance of the Basin Plan’s stringent turbidity standard (10
percent above background levels) after the construction phase. This impact would be significant.

Possible risks from natural channel adjustment effects (described further under Impact 3.9-2 [Alt. 1]) would be
reduced under Alternative 4 because the final channel size, shape, and bed and bank materials would be installed
during construction, and natural channel adjustments would not be needed to meet final design conditions.
However, constructing an “inset” floodplain would require work immediately adjacent to the low-flow channel
and would not allow the revegetated areas to be isolated from potential high flows. Final design materials,
methods, and revegetation specifications would anticipate this challenge and would use the most effective means
to create surfaces that would be stable immediately upon installation. If construction were followed by relatively
normal- to low-streamflow years, the risk of disturbance to the revegetated surfaces would be lower than if
construction were followed by high-streamflow water years. However, water year conditions cannot be predicted
with multiyear accuracy to help schedule construction, and because the Upper Truckee River is an unregulated
river, it would not be possible to manage streamflows after construction.
The modified channel bank and low-flow streambed, constructed “inset” floodplain areas, and other disturbed but
revegetated surfaces would therefore be highly susceptible to erosion if a large flood were to occur within the first

few years after construction. A high risk of sediment mobilization would occur if a major flood event were to
occur before the vegetation could mature. Despite efforts to minimize risks, the effects could cause a violation of
Section 5.2 of the Basin Plan (i.e., the stringent turbidity standard of ten percent above background levels). This
impact would be significant.
Mitigation Measure 3.9-2 (Alt. 4): Adaptively Manage Potential Flood Disturbance in the Interim Period after
Construction.
This mitigation measure is identical to Mitigation Measure 3.9-2 (Alt. 1).
Significance after Mitigation: With implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.9-2 (Alt. 4) as described above, the
short-term risk of surface-water or groundwater degradation following construction would be minimized, because
potential flood damage in the interim period after construction would be adaptively managed. However, the
potential for at least short-term violations of the stringent water quality standard for turbidity cannot be feasibly
eliminated. Because of the potential to exceed this stringent standard, Impact 3.9-2 (Alt. 4) would be significant
and unavoidable.
IMPACT
3.9-3
(Alt. 4)

Upper Truckee River Channel Erosion within the Study Area. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 4 would
involve making direct changes to the channel of the Upper Truckee River to create an inset floodplain in the
upper reach and increase channel sinuosity in the straightened reach. The changes would offset past
geomorphic responses to historic disturbances by constructing features to provide overbank flow opportunities
and reduce streambank erosion. This would result in a long-term benefit by decreasing flow depths and
velocities in low to moderate flood events and reducing the potential for erosion of the channel bed and banks.
This impact would be beneficial.

Under Alternative 4, the length of “geomorphically sized” channel within the study area would increase from
about 500 feet to 6,700 feet (Exhibit 2-4). The new channel morphology would be more stable while efficiently
transporting sediment under typical flows. The modified channel would likely experience less erosion than the
existing oversized channel. Alternative 4 also proposes the construction of inset floodplains along the existing
river from RS 0+00 to RS 67+00. The existing terrace would be lowered (one-three feet) on either side of the
existing channel for widths ranging from about 20 to 220 feet. The area of inset floodplain would be
approximately 12 acres. In addition, the width and capacity of the existing low-flow channel would be reduced.
Creating the lowered floodplain surface would increase the area of inundation, overbanking frequency, and the
width of flow during the two-year event. This condition would reduce flow velocities and active channel bank
heights, reducing the potential for erosion during small to moderate flow events.
The alternative also proposes to create a more sinuous channel through the existing straightened reach (RS 67+00
to RS 93+00). Localized alternating bank cuts and fills would be used selectively to form low-amplitude
meanders. Increasing sinuosity would increase channel length and decrease channel slope relative to existing
conditions. These changes would be expected to reduce flow velocities in low to moderate flow conditions.
Also proposed by Alternative 4 is the installation of bank protection/stabilization for areas of the right (east) bank
downstream of the U.S. 50 bridge. This protection would address existing unstable banks and areas of the bank
most prone to erosion and failure.
The combined effect of creating the inset floodplain and modifying the channel would be to reduce erosion
potential throughout the proposed channel/floodplain area. This would be a beneficial effect of Alternative 4.
Compilation of the TMDL streambank-erosion results (California Water Boards and NDEP 2008) for specific
subreaches of the Upper Truckee River allows a quantitative estimate of the effect of the proposed alternatives on
stream channel erosion (Table 3.9-17). Using the range of treatment tiers analyzed for the TMDL, the estimated
reduction in fine sediment loads from streambank erosion in the study area under Alternative 4 would be about

58 percent (reduced to 228 cubic yards from 538 cubic yards under existing conditions and the No-Project/NoAction Alternative). The study area is a small portion of the entire 15-mile-long river, and the proposed action
alternatives alone would reduce the entire Upper Truckee River’s fine sediment load from streambanks by about
1 percent relative to existing conditions. While small, this would be a considerable and measurable benefit
relative to the degraded existing condition or No-Project/No-Action Alternative.
This impact addresses long-term benefits associated with a net reduction of erosion. However, all stream
restoration projects, particularly those that incorporate geomorphic process–based adjustments as part of the
design elements, may experience localized channel erosion during an interim period following construction. The
potential adverse water quality impacts of such adjustments (including unexpected changes or responses to flood
disturbance) were described as a significant short-term impact above in Impact 3.9-3 (Alt. 4). The mitigation for
that impact, Mitigation Measure 3.9-2 (Alt. 4), requires implementation of an adaptive management plan that
commits to actions that would prevent short-term water quality problems from becoming chronic, thus ensuring
that the long-term improvements to Upper Truckee River conditions expected under Impact 3.9-3 (Alt. 4) can be
realized. This impact would be beneficial.
IMPACT
3.9-4
(Alt. 4)

Trout Creek Channel Erosion within the Study Area. (CEQA 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2, 3) Implementing Alternative 4
would not involve directly modifying the channel of Trout Creek or modifying the Upper Truckee River at or
downstream of its confluence with Trout Creek. Therefore, no significant hydraulic change would be proposed
that would change the existing conditions relative erosion potential in Trout Creek. No impact would occur.

No quantitative estimate of streambank erosion loads or load reduction potential along Trout Creek was made in
studies for the TMDL (California Water Boards and NDEP 2008). However, based on geomorphic principles and
qualitative analysis, Alternative 4 would be expected to have the following varied effects on erosion of the Trout
Creek channel within the study area.
Alternative 4 would not raise and/or stabilize the existing streambed elevation of the degraded reach of the Upper
Truckee River at the mouth of Trout Creek (Exhibit 2-4), and would not substantially change the amount of flow
carried by the Trout Creek main channel and distributaries under normal or flood conditions. This would produce
an effect on lower Trout Creek that is neutral relative to the existing, degraded conditions.
It is possible that persistent low lake levels (potentially caused by climate change) could initiate incision of the
Upper Truckee River that could migrate upstream into Trout Creek (see Impact 3.9-3 [Alt. 4]).These potential
future river responses would not represent a change relative to the existing conditions or No-Project/No-Action
Alternative. Therefore, no impact would occur.

(Alt. 4)

Erosion of Backfilled and/or Remnant Channel Segments on the Floodplain. (CEQA 1, 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2, 3)
Implementing Alternative 4 would not involve abandoning and backfilling the existing Upper Truckee River, and
would not increase the frequency with which existing remnant channel segments on the floodplain would be
inundated. The risks of erosion and/or mobilization of organics and sediment within the floodplain topography
would remain similar to existing risks. No impact would occur.

Under Alternative 4, the entire existing Upper Truckee River channel alignment would be used as the active lowflow channel. This alternative would not involve backfilling abandoned portions to function as part of the active
floodplain. Implementing Alternative 4 would not raise the streambed elevation or decrease the channel capacity;
therefore, it would not substantially modify the frequency or magnitude of overbank flows (during low to
moderate flows) that access the existing floodplain (terrace) surface across the study area. Therefore,
implementing Alternative 4 would not increase the potential for erosion and sediment production related to
increased flow in backfilled abandoned channels or remnant channels. No impact would occur.
IMPACT
3.9-6
(Alt. 4)

Retention of Fine Sediment and Nutrients within the Study Area. (NEPA) Implementing Alternative 4
would reduce the capacity of the Upper Truckee River channel. This alternative would involve constructing an
inset floodplain along the river in the upstream portion of the study area and improving sinuosity in the
downstream, straightened reach. These modifications would increase the frequency of overbanking, enlarge
the area of functional active floodplain, and offset past geomorphic adjustments to historic disturbances.
Overtopping of the banks during small to moderate flood peaks would result in an improvement in fine
sediment and nutrient retention on the inset floodplain and some portions of the marsh surface. This impact
would be beneficial.

Under Alternative 4, the channel of the existing Upper Truckee River would be modified to create an inset
floodplain in the reach of river from RS 0+00 to RS 67+00. Approximately 12 acres of inset floodplain would be
created by lowering the existing terrace surface one-three feet. The alternative also proposes modifications to the
channel between RS 67+00 and RS 93+00 that would decrease channel capacity. The proposed channel design
would increase the frequency of overbanking, promoting the retention of sediment on the floodplain and a
reduction in transport of fine sediment to Lake Tahoe.
Implementing Alternative 4 would increase the area of inundation during the 2-year event (assuming median lake
level) from 65 to 82 acres and the length of overtopped bank from 2,129 feet to 17,633 feet. Overbanking would
occur along approximately 85 percent of the length of new channel, compared to 10 percent under existing
conditions (Table 3.9-18). The flows would spread out over newly created inset floodplain areas and expanded
areas on the existing floodplain. As the flows spread out, the flow velocities would decrease, promoting the
retention of some of the transported sediment (including fine sediment) and associated nutrients. Implementing
this alternative would increase the potential for retention of fine sediment and decrease the potential for finesediment transport to Lake Tahoe. Neither changes to coarse-sediment discharges nor long-term changes to
littoral processes would be expected to occur. This impact would be beneficial.

3.9-7
(Alt. 4)

Decreased Delivery of Coarse Sediment to Cove East and Barton Beaches. (TRPA 2) Implementing
Alternative 4 would not directly modify the streambed elevation or continuity of the Upper Truckee River’s lowflow channel through the study area to Lake Tahoe, and therefore would be unlikely to modify the transport of
coarse sediment to beach areas adjacent to the river’s mouth. The ongoing trend of net beach erosion would
continue. Any determination regarding long-term effects of climate change on coarse-sediment transport and
delivery downstream would be too speculative for a meaningful conclusion. In the short term, however,
implementing Alternative 4 would neither modify the streambed profile nor reconnect and increase the potential
for sediment deposition in existing lagoon areas (Sailing Lagoon or East Barton Beach). No impact would
occur in the short term.

In the long term, climate change effects could either exacerbate or counteract present trends in the study area.
Potential long-term effects could range from worse than the existing degraded condition to a possible
improvement. Any determination regarding climate change effects on coarse-sediment transport and delivery
downstream would be too speculative for a meaningful conclusion. In the short term, however, implementing
Alternative 4 would not modify transport and retention of coarse sediment within various portions of the study
area, and coarse-sediment delivery to the adjacent beaches would remain similar to deliveries under existing
conditions. The design elements of Alternative 4 include a low-flow channel that would be complete at the time of
construction, at the existing grade, and none of the features would require aggradation to meet the finished grade
or function. No changes to the input of coarse sediment to the littoral zone would be expected. No impact would
occur.
IMPACT
3.9-8
(Alt. 4)

Stormwater Drainage and Treatment. (CEQA 1, 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2, 3) Implementing Alternative 4 would
involve constructing and operating permanent recreational features. Developing these features could
potentially result in release of pollutants and degradation of water quality. As described in Environmental
Commitments 5, 6, and 11, effective permanent BMPs to protect water quality would be included in the final
design of all recreation features. This impact would be less than significant.

Alternative 4 proposes new, permanent recreational facilities within the study area, including a self-service kiosk
on the west margin adjacent to East Venice Drive and a trail connecting these facilities to Cove East Beach. Also
proposed are viewpoints and a trail along the eastern margin and a bike path north of Springwood Drive. The
facilities generally would be restricted to the margins of the SEZ to minimize the extent of encroachment in this
sensitive area. Developing these features would require disturbance of floodplain areas within an SEZ, presenting
potential erosion hazards. Recreational facilities with impervious cover (e.g., pavements, roofs, and other
structures) could also increase or concentrate runoff and increase erosion potential.
The design of these features has not been finalized. However, without proper mitigation of their effects, these
features may increase the potential for the transport of sediment or other pollutants to surface water bodies, which
would be a potentially significant effect. However, the Conservancy would implement ECs 5 and 6 (Table 2-6).
Implementing these environmental commitments would require implementation of effective construction site
management plans and compliance with federal and state permits and thus would minimize short-term
construction-related impacts. The final project design and implementation would include permanent stormwater
detention features or infiltration systems for runoff from areas of proposed impervious surfaces (see Impact 3.8-1
[Alt. 4] in Section 3.8, “Hydrology and Flooding,” for further discussion). The Conservancy would also
implement EC 11 to provide effective permanent BMPs for all recreation features. With implementation of ECs 5,
6, and 11, this impact would be less than significant.

stringent turbidity standard (10 percent above background levels). No impact would occur.

Under Alternative 5, the Conservancy would not conduct new or substantial construction or excavation activities
within the study area. No construction would occur that could increase susceptibility to erosion and sedimentation
or accidental release of other pollutants. Emergency or routine repairs to public utilities, infrastructure, or private
property within the study area would be implemented, if needed, by other public and private entities. Such
activities would be evaluated separately for compliance with existing laws and regulations. No impact would

Short-Term, Project-Related Risk of Surface Water Degradation Following Construction. (CEQA 1, 2, 3;

require a period of channel adjustments following construction to meet final design. Therefore, implementing
this alternative would not make any changes to the existing condition that could increase the short-term risk of
water quality degradation following construction. No impact would occur.

Under Alternative 5, Conservancy would not conduct new or substantial construction or excavation activities within
the study area, and no features would be installed that require geomorphic adjustments to meet final design. No
disturbed areas would be created that would increase susceptibility to erosion and sedimentation during a flood after
construction. Emergency or routine repairs to public utilities, infrastructure, or private property within the study area
would be implemented, if needed, by other public and private entities. Such activities would be evaluated separately
for compliance with existing laws and regulations. No impact would occur.

3.9-3
(Alt. 5)

Upper Truckee River Channel Erosion within the Study Area. (CEQA 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2, 3) Implementing
Alternative 5 would not involve making direct changes to the channel of the Upper Truckee River. However,
natural geomorphic response to historic disturbances would continue, with channel instability that would erode the
streambanks and streambed within the study area, releasing sediment and nutrients that would degrade the river
and lake water quality relative to undisturbed natural conditions. Implementing Alternative 5 would allow the
adverse conditions to persist, but this would not be a change from existing conditions. Therefore, this impact
would be less than significant.

Rates of stream channel erosion along the Upper Truckee River in the study area and along the upstream reaches
have been accelerated relative to natural conditions by the geomorphic response to past direct human actions
throughout the watershed and at particular locations on the river. These direct human actions typically decreased
stream length and increased channel slope, width and depth, and/or bank heights. As a result, erosion occurred
during or after the disturbance, generating total sediment and fine sediment loads that have exceeded natural
conditions. Channel conditions in particular river reaches influenced erosion processes in other reaches, with
erosion and sedimentation influences occurring both upstream and downstream of disturbances. At several sites
along the Upper Truckee River, various types of streambank protection measures were installed to help limit
erosion. However, the measures only addressed local sites and did not include streambed protection, so their
effectiveness and life spans were limited.
The existing conditions continue to be degraded and erosion exceeds natural rates. Studies for the Lake Tahoe
TMDL have documented the existing degraded condition of the Upper Truckee River from field observations
(Simon et al. 2003). Calculations performed for these studies have demonstrated that the Upper Truckee River is

the largest contributor of fine sediment from streambanks to the lake (Simon 2006, California Water Boards and
NDEP 2007).
Substantial direct historical modifications were also made to channels in the study area. During the Comstock era,
logging and log transport and installation of road crossings and piers affected local hydraulics and scour. In the
early 1900s water infrastructure (including irrigation ditches) shortened and straightened channels and constructed
ditches; and in the 1950s and 1960s, as part of urban development, some channel segments were cut off, new
channels were dredged, and the lower reach of the Upper Truckee River was straightened and dredged. Recent
restoration efforts within the study area at the Lower West Side Restoration Area wetlands lowered bank heights
and partially offset past actions that increased erosion in the lower reach of the Upper Truckee River.
Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, the Upper Truckee River would continue to respond to past
disturbances. The progressive geomorphic adjustment along the Upper Truckee River would occur primarily in
the form of streambank erosion and widening, followed by streambed deposition in some upstream reaches.
Simulations of future channel adjustments performed for the TMDL studies (Simon et al. 2003) estimate channel
width and streambed elevation for the Upper Truckee River over a 50-year period (Exhibit 3.9-15). These data
suggest that bank erosion and channel widening would progress rapidly over the next decade in some reaches
(e.g., five kilometers upstream of the river’s mouth) and slowly for decades in other areas (e.g., seven kilometers
upstream). The magnitude of channel widening may be substantial, with estimates ranging from several feet in
most areas to more than 20 feet in some locations. The changes in streambed elevation would be smaller, with
deposition expected to occur in much of the system, ranging up to one foot in most areas and a couple of feet
thick in a few locations. The simulations indicate that net streambed erosion would occur in some locations,
including portions of the study area (e.g., zero - one kilometers upstream).
Future channel erosion under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, while generally expected to follow a
predictable trend based on geomorphic channel evolution models described above, could be altered by climate
change. Climate change may modify future hydrology and sediment loads from the watershed. However, the
effects of climate change were not specifically represented in the TMDL modeling, which assumed future
hydrology similar to the historic record. Increased rainfall as a proportion of total precipitation, increased runoff
during winter, decreased snow water equivalent, and decreased spring/summer runoff are climate change
conditions that could limit the rate of natural recovery within the incised channel system.
There could also be offsetting effects of climate change on stream channel erosion. For example, vegetation
encroachment on channels resulting from lower average annual flows may help stabilize some existing
streambanks. However, the potential for severe rain or rain-on-snow floods and associated erosion effects may
remain the same or even increase.
Another adverse effect of climate change on channel erosion within the study area may occur if total runoff to
Lake Tahoe were to decrease and the lake level were to stay below historic elevations more often or for sustained
periods. This would lower the base elevation at the mouth of the Upper Truckee River and worsen streambed
erosion (i.e., incision) locally, even relative to the TMDL simulation. If incision were to occur, the effect would
be likely to migrate upstream in the river (and possibly Trout Creek), resulting in channel erosion and
destabilization of channel banks.
Recent restoration efforts within the study area at the Lower West Side Restoration Area lowered bank heights
and partially offset past actions that increased erosion in that reach of the Upper Truckee River. Ongoing
restoration efforts upstream in the Middle Reach of the Upper Truckee River (Reaches 3 and 4) are adding
channel length, reducing slope, and creating new channel segments with appropriate bank heights. Implementing
these improvements is expected to result in a more functional channel with natural bank erosion rates. These
efforts will partially offset the effects of past actions in the respective project reaches, but are not expected to
correct the accelerated channel erosion throughout the system (e.g., not directly address conditions within the
study area).

the existing condition and for a range of treatments to reduce streambank erosion. Compilation of the results for

(Alt. 5)

Trout Creek Channel Erosion within the Study Area. (CEQA 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2, 3) Implementing Alternative 5
would not involve directly modifying the channel of Trout Creek. However, Trout Creek would continue
responding to historic disturbances with instability that would erode its streambanks and streambed within the
study area and release sediment and nutrients that would degrade water quality in the creek and lake relative
to undisturbed natural conditions. Implementing Alternative 5 would allow the adverse conditions to persist, but
this would not be a change from existing conditions. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

The Trout Creek channel(s) in the study area and upstream reaches have experienced accelerated erosion in
response to watershed-wide and site-specific past actions. The direct actions and the geomorphic responses to
those actions have created increased rates of streambed and streambank erosion. Some past actions on the
watershed scale, such as logging and transporting logs using stream channels and ditches or water supply
diversions and ditches, had direct effects on channels within the study area and along upstream reaches. Some of
the direct modifications made to the Upper Truckee River channel in the study area also affected Trout Creek,
particularly the straightening and dredging near the mouth of the Upper Truckee River, which also lowered the
base elevation at the mouth of Trout Creek. Many of these actions reduced stream length and increased channel
slope, depths, and/or bank heights, resulting in direct or subsequent increases in channel erosion that generated
total sediment and fine sediment loads at rates that exceed natural conditions.
Restoration efforts over the last decade upstream within the Trout Creek system have restored upstream channel
segments on Trout Creek and its tributary, Cold Creek, to have more appropriate slopes, dimensions, and bank
heights than their degraded historic condition. These efforts have partially offset the effects of past actions in their
respective project reaches, but have not resulted in systemwide correction to the accelerated channel erosion.
Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, changes would occur along Trout Creek within the study area as it
would continue to respond to past disturbances. The progressive geomorphic adjustment along Trout Creek and
its distributary channels would occur primarily in the form of streambed erosion in the lower reach. Channel
erosion would continue at an accelerated rate for a period of time, eventually stabilizing after a period of years to
decades under likely trends based on geomorphic channel-evolution models. Quantitative modeling of future

channel erosion on Trout Creek has not been performed for the TMDL; the expected trends, which are based on
conceptual models, could be altered by the effects of climate change. Increased rainfall as a proportion of total
precipitation, increased runoff during winter, decreased snow water equivalent, and decreased spring/summer
runoff are all likely to limit the rate of natural recovery within the incised channel systems.
Offsetting indirect effects of climate change on stream channel erosion could occur. It is possible that vegetation
encroachment within channels resulting from lower average annual flows may help stabilize some of the existing
incised streambanks, but the potential for severe rain or rain-on-snow floods may stay the same or even increase.
Another adverse potential effect of climate change on channel erosion within the study area may occur if total
runoff to Lake Tahoe were to decrease and the lake level were to stay below historic median elevations more of
the time or for longer durations. A lower lake level would lower the base elevation at the mouth of Trout Creek,
potentially worsening ongoing and expected streambed erosion within that portion of the study area.
Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, continued or increased channel erosion is expected in Trout Creek
as it continues to adjust to past disturbance. Channel erosion along the lower reach of Trout Creek would continue
to exceed natural background conditions under Alternative 5. Although this is an adverse condition that would
continue, it is not a change from existing conditions. This impact would be less than significant.

Erosion of Backfilled and/or Remnant Channel Segments on the Floodplain. (CEQA 1, 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2,

and would not increase the frequency with which existing remnant channel segments on the floodplain would
be inundated. The risks of erosion and/or mobilization of organics and sediment within the floodplain
topography would remain similar to existing risks. No impact would occur.

Alternative 5 would not involve modifying the location or capacity of the Upper Truckee River or modifying the
frequency or magnitude of overbank flows that access the existing floodplain (terrace) surface across the study
area. The potential for floodplain erosion to occur and mobilize organics and/or sediment that have accumulated
within remnant channel features at various locations throughout the marsh would remain under Alternative 5. This
would not be a change from existing conditions. No impact would occur.

Retention of Fine Sediment and Nutrients within the Study Area. (CEQA 1, 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2, 3)
Implementing Alternative 5 would not directly modify the channel capacity, elevation, frequency of overbanking,
or area of functional active floodplain, although future natural geomorphic adjustments to historic disturbances
would be expected to eventually form a small inset floodplain below the terrace banks. Implementing this
alternative would allow the existing impaired fine sediment and nutrient retention conditions to persist. This
impact would be less than significant.

Relative to natural conditions, stream channel and floodplain connections, active floodplain areas, and
overbanking processes that prompt deposition of fine sediment and retention of nutrients are degraded in the study
area and along the upstream reaches of the Upper Truckee River. This degradation has resulted from past
watershed-wide and site-specific direct actions and the stream’s geomorphic response to those actions. The river
channel is enlarged, banks are high, and fill has been placed in some floodplain areas. These conditions have
reduced the frequency of overbank flow and the extent of active floodplain. These changes, in turn, have
decreased the opportunity for and effectiveness of floodplain deposition of suspended sediment and/or the
trapping and transformation of attached or dissolved nutrients.
The connectivity of the Upper Truckee River channel in the study area to its floodplain has been reduced by
watershed-wide and site-specific past actions. Various direct actions and the geomorphic responses to those
actions have enlarged the channel, increased bank heights, and placed fill within floodplain areas, and thus
reduced the frequency of overbank flows and the extent of floodplain inundation. These effects have decreased

the opportunity for and effectiveness of floodplain deposition of suspended sediment and/or the trapping and
transformation of attached or dissolved nutrients.
Studies for the Lake Tahoe TMDL have documented the existing degraded condition of the Upper Truckee River,
reported the magnitude of total and fine sediment loads, and calculated nutrient loads delivered to Lake Tahoe
based on U.S. Geological Survey records (Simon et al. 2003, Simon 2006, California Water Boards and NDEP
2007). The loads reaching the lake reflect the net effect of numerous sources and sinks (or storage) throughout the
watershed and along the stream corridor, not just the floodplain processes. The TMDL studies included estimates
of several of the watershed’s pollutant sources and opportunities to reduce loads from those sources (California
Water Boards and NDEP 2007). However, little information is available to quantify the degree of impairment of
floodplain processes as a sink for sediment and nutrients along the Upper Truckee River in the study area, relative
to a natural or undisturbed condition.
Conceptual models that link channel and floodplain characteristics to sediment and nutrient sources and sinks and
some limited field data have been the basis of discussions of the existing versus restored conditions to date
(Conservancy and DGS 2003:Chapter 12; California Water Boards and NDEP 2008:Stream Cannel Erosion Load
Reduction Analysis, Appendix A). A few studies have collected field data regarding overbank flows and
information about floodplain sedimentation within the study area. Postconstruction monitoring at the restored
Lower West Side project included visual observation and measured the accumulation of sediment on the restored
floodplain wetlands. Analysis of soil cores collected in the study area documented modern net sedimentation in
the Upper Truckee Marsh even under the degraded channel conditions, but at rates that only capture a small
portion of the suspended sediment in the streamflow entering the study area (Winter 2003:90).
Observations at seven sampling sites in the study area during the 2003 snowmelt season identified patterns and
amounts of suspended sediment and total phosphorus retention on the Upper Truckee River versus Trout Creek
portions of the study area (Stubblefield et al. 2006). These field data indicate that the more functional floodplain
along Trout Creek retained 68–90 percent of the suspended sediment and 61–85 percent of the total phosphorus,
while areas along the degraded Upper Truckee River retained only 26 percent of the suspended sediment and
24 percent of the total phosphorus (Stubblefield et al. 2006). Conceptual models of floodplain processes and the
limited local data both suggest that improved floodplain connectivity and floodplain conditions, as well as
frequent overbank flows, would increase net sedimentation and nutrient retention as water quality treatment.
Recent restoration efforts within the study area at the Lower West Side Restoration Area excavated fill that had
been placed on the natural floodplain, lowered bank heights, and specifically created a low area on the west side
of the existing channel. The low area increased the opportunity for river water to overflow into the restoration site
despite the enlarged existing channel and common lake backwater. These measures partially offset past actions by
increasing the extent of floodplain connectivity and overbanking for a small section of the Upper Truckee River in
the study area, restoring 12 acres of improved floodplain. However, this would not be expected to correct the
decreased floodplain connectivity, area, and function that persist in other portions of the study area.
Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, changes would occur along the Upper Truckee River and Trout
Creek channels within the study area as these streams would continue to respond to past disturbances. The
progressive geomorphic adjustment along the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek within the study area is
expected to further enlarge the channels and worsen the existing degraded floodplain connectivity. No future
direct or indirect reductions of floodplain area or storage capacity are expected under the No-Project/No-Action
Alternative. The channel(s) and 65.0-acre inundation area for the 2-year event in the study area would not be
directly modified. The active floodplain area (Table 3.9-20) and potential for frequent overbanking would be
either similar to existing conditions or potentially worse in locations where the channel capacity would continue
to enlarge. These factors would reduce the frequency, area, and duration of floodplain inundation. Small increases
in active floodplain area could occur in some reaches where channel incision and widening had progressed to the
point of creating an inset floodplain between terrace banks. However, net retention of sediment and nutrients
would not necessarily be improved substantially because these inset surfaces would be more vulnerable to

disturbance during high flows than would active floodplains on the surrounding terrace. Therefore, the
opportunity for floodplain processes to provide water quality treatment in the study area and upstream would be
further degraded under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative.

Future overbanking and floodplain processes under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative could also worsen with
the effects of climate change. Precipitation changes, reduced percentage of precipitation as snow, and temperature
increases associated with climate change would likely reduce mean streamflows, average annual runoff, and the
magnitude of peak streamflow expected frequently (i.e., every two-five years). Additionally, incision of the
channels in response to lowered lake levels would be expected to exacerbate the increase in channel capacity and
decrease connectivity. Therefore, climate change could exacerbate the existing degraded condition by further
reducing the frequency at which the existing design overbank flow (i.e., 760 cfs for the study area) would occur.
Therefore, the opportunity for floodplain processes to provide water quality treatment would be further degraded
in the study area under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative. The adverse existing conditions would not change
under Alternative 5. This impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.9-7
(Alt. 5)

Decreased Delivery of Coarse Sediment to Cove East and Barton Beaches. (TRPA 2) Implementing
Alternative 5 would not directly modify the streambed elevation or continuity of the Upper Truckee River’s lowflow channel through the study area to Lake Tahoe, and therefore would not modify the transport of coarse
sediment to beach areas adjacent to the river’s mouth. The ongoing trend of net beach erosion would continue.
In the long term, climate change effects could either exacerbate or counteract present trends. Potential longterm effects could range from worse than the existing degraded condition to a possible improvement. Any
determination regarding long-term effects of climate change on coarse-sediment transport and delivery
downstream would be too speculative for a meaningful conclusion. In the short term, however,
implementing Alternative 5 would neither modify coarse-sediment transport and deposition within various
portions of the study area nor affect delivery of coarse sediment to the adjacent beaches. The short-term
impact would be less than significant.

Past direct actions throughout the watersheds, at the lake outlet, and in the study area, along with the geomorphic
responses to those actions, have resulted in net erosion of Cove East and Barton Beaches since the early 1900s,
producing a degraded condition relative to the predevelopment shoreline. At the watershed scale, past actions
such as logging in the late 1800s and urban development in the mid 1900s temporarily increased delivery of
sediment to the lake, including coarse sediment that supplied local beaches.
During the last few decades, coarse sediment carried by the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek has been
insufficient to maintain the historic length, width, or thickness of beach deposits. In addition, potential waveenergy effects on all Lake Tahoe beaches have increased since the late 1800s. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation
management of lake levels holds water in storage and keeps the lake at a high elevation when possible. Sitespecific actions since the 1950s, most importantly the initial and maintenance dredging of the Tahoe Keys

navigation channels west of the Upper Truckee River, have directly reduced the supply of beach sediment to the
study area. Dredging of navigation channels interrupts the movement of beach sand along the local shoreline and
has directly resulted in net removal of all dredged sediment, including coarse sediment that would be supplied to
beaches. These past actions have resulted in considerable and continued shoreline retreat in the study area.
Historic beach erosion in the study area has especially affected active, largely unvegetated sand deposits, but it
has also disturbed locations with dense herbaceous vegetation and mature conifers rooted in soils along the beach
ridge.
Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, delivery of coarse sediment from upstream to the study area beaches
would change as the watersheds and stream channels continued to respond to past disturbances, ongoing
management, and to the influences of climate change. No quantitative projections have been made of the net
effects of all these factors on future delivery of coarse sediment. Recent historic conditions, with relatively low
yield of coarse sediment from the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek watersheds, are expected to be followed
by declining sand or coarser loads as channels continue to widen and the streambed stabilizes (with net deposition
in certain reaches) (Exhibit 3.9-16). It is possible that flood processes from rainfall runoff could result in periodic
increases in loads of coarse sediment, even if most years have reduced transport of coarse sediment compared to
existing conditions. No further modifications to management of the lake outlet (Reclamation 2008) would be
expected under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative. Relatively high lake elevations would continue to be
maintained for water supply unless climate change–related decreases in runoff or other effects were to lower the
lake level. Dredging of the navigation channel west of the study area would be expected to continue without sand
replenishment.

The net effect of the above factors on future beach erosion at the study area is highly uncertain and difficult to
predict. There could be a continuing adverse trend of net deficit of coarse sediment. Continued or increasing
beach erosion could advance landward into the soils and marsh sediments behind the beach ridge, potentially
increasing environmental damage relative to the existing degraded condition. However, it is also possible that
climate change could result in lowered lake levels that would reduce potential wave energy along the existing
beach ridge. The net effect of these factors has not been quantified and is highly uncertain, but could range from
worse than the existing degraded condition to a possible improvement in beach erosion.
Implementing Alternative 5 would not alter existing conditions. Depending on which climate change influences
were to occur, they could either exacerbate or improve conditions with regard to coarse-sediment transport and
delivery to the beaches. Therefore, this impact remains too speculative for a meaningful significance
conclusion.
IMPACT
3.9-8
(Alt. 5)

Stormwater Drainage and Treatment. (CEQA 1, 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2, 3) Implementing Alternative 5 would not
provide additional stormwater pretreatment and/or flow routing improvements to enhance water quality
treatment before discharge to the SEZ or directly to the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek in the study
area. No new recreation facilities or features would be constructed. The existing conditions would be allowed to
persist. No impact would occur.

Under Alternative 5, no measures would be implemented along the margins of the study area to provide additional
stormwater treatment and/or flow routing improvements to enhance water quality treatment before discharge
within the SEZ and/or directly to the surface water in Trout Creek or the Upper Truckee River. New recreation
features would not be constructed or operated under this alternative. Therefore, the existing condition of
stormwater drainage or treatment would not change. No impact would occur.

3.10 LAND USE
This section describes the regulatory setting relevant to land use in the study area, existing land uses within the
study area and vicinity, and impacts of Alternatives 1–5. Cumulative public services impacts are addressed in
Section 3.18, “Cumulative Impacts.” Consistency with TRPA goals and policies is presented in Table 3.10-1.

3.10.1

AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

REGULATORY SETTING
Numerous federal, state, regional, and local laws, rules, regulations, plans, and policies define the framework for
regulating land use in the Tahoe Basin. The following discussion focuses on land use-related requirements
applicable to the proposed alternatives.
Federal
No federal plans, policies, regulations, or laws related to land use are applicable to the proposed alternatives under
consideration.
State
The following state program related to land use is relevant to the proposed alternatives and is described in detail
in Chapter 5, “Compliance, Consultation, and Coordination”:
►

California State Lands Commission management of public lands

Tahoe Regional Planning Agency
Regional Plan Goals and Policies
The Goals and Policies document for the 1987 Regional Plan establishes an overall framework for development
and environmental conservation in the Lake Tahoe region. TRPA goals and policies are included for six elements:
land use, transportation, conservation, recreation, public services and facilities, and implementation (TRPA 2006).
The goals and policies relevant to the project are listed in Table 3.10-1 and are discussed in Section 3.10.2,
“Environmental Consequences and Mitigation Measures,” below.
Code of Ordinances
The TRPA Code of Ordinances establishes standards and regulations for implementation of the Regional Plan for
the Tahoe Basin. Public agencies and organizations in the Basin must comply with TRPA provisions or may
establish equivalent or higher requirements in their jurisdiction. The Code of Ordinances is a coordinated series of
documents addressing environmental and land-use planning issues in the Tahoe Basin, including the Tahoe
Regional Planning Compact, environmental threshold carrying capacities, Goals and Policies, the Plan Area
Statements and maps, and other TRPA plans and programs. The Code of Ordinances is intended to implement the
Goals and Policies while maintaining the environmental thresholds (TRPA 2011).
A September 16, 2010 federal ruling struck down updated shorezone ordinances; TRPA is currently appealing the
ruling. The decision to appeal follows an assessment by the agency of the ruling over the complex environmental
analysis of rules that were crafted to resolve multiple Lake Tahoe shorezone issues. The lawsuit was brought by
the League to Save Lake Tahoe and the Sierra Club. The Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration project
application was submitted prior to this ruling and will be processed under rules that were in effect prior to the
October, 2008 adoption (TRPA 2010).

All of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would involve providing
recreation opportunities and improving the natural values of the Upper
Truckee River within the study area. Under Alternative 5, the No
Project/No Action Alternative, the study area would remain as a habitat area
and an area of informal recreation, which would continue to support natural
and recreational uses.

Policy 2: The Regional Plan gives a high priority
to correcting past deficiencies in land use. The
Plan shall encourage a redirection strategy for
substantially and adversely altered areas, wherever
feasible.

Y

Y

Y

Y

NA

All of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would include
enhancements that would improve effects of past land use or remove
coverage of the Upper Truckee River and various other habitats in the study
area.
Alternative 5, the No Project/No Action Alternative, would not involve
changing land uses in the study area, which would support recreational uses,
but would not restore the river or redirect recreational access away from
sensitive habitats.

3.10-2

Policy 1: The primary function of the region shall
be as a mountain recreation area with outstanding
scenic and natural values.

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

Land Use Goal 2: Direct the amount and location of new land uses in conformance with the environmental threshold carrying capacities and other goals of
the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact.
Policy 2: Specific land use policies shall be
implemented through the use of planning area
statements for each of the planning areas identified
in the map included in the Regional Plan. Areas of
similar use and character have been mapped and
categorized within one or more of the following
five land use classifications: conservation,
recreation, residential, commercial and public
service, and tourist. These land use classifications
shall dictate allowable land uses.

The study area is located in six PASs 99 (Al Tahoe), 100 (Truckee Marsh),
102 (Tahoe Keys), 103 (Sierra Tract Commercial), 104 (Highland Woods),
and 111 (Tahoe Island). Alternatives 1–5 would be consistent with the
permissible uses in these PASs.

Policy 3: The Plan Area Statements shall also
identify the management theme for each planning
area by designating each area for (1) maximum
regulation, (2) development with mitigation, or (3)
redirection of development. These designations
shall provide additional policy direction for
regulating land use.

Implementing any of the action alternatives would result in an increase in
recreational development; however, long-term environmental impacts of
development would be mitigated with the exception of recreational
development under Alternative 1 related to the bridge and potential effects
to Tahoe yellow cress. All other components of Alternative 1 and the other
action alternatives would redirect recreational access away from sensitive
habitats. Implementing Alternative 5 would not result in a change in

Policy 4: The Plan Area Statements set forth
special policy direction to respond to the particular
need, problems, and future development of a
specific area. Each Plan Area Statement may vary
in detail or specificity depending on the nature of
the area and the detail or specificity related to local
jurisdictional plans.

The study area is located in six PASs 99 (Al Tahoe), 100 (Truckee Marsh),
102 (Tahoe Keys), 103 (Sierra Tract Commercial), 104 (Highland Woods),
and 111 (Tahoe Island). Alternatives 1–5 would be consistent with the
permissible uses in these PASs.

Policy 5: All Plan Area Statements, community
plans, or other specific plans adopted by the
agency shall specify the total additional
development which may be permitted within the
region, not to exceed the limitations set forth in A,
B, C, D, and E in the Regional Plan.
Reconstruction and relocation of existing
development are not considered additional
development.

Y

Y

Y

Y

Y

None of the alternatives (Alternatives 1–5) would include additional
residential, commercial, or public service development. Therefore, these uses
would not be increased under any of the alternatives. Implementing
Alternative 1, 3, or 4 would include one or two kiosks, which would not
likely require the allocation of summer-day-use PAOTs, and if necessary,
sufficient summer-day-use PAOTs are currently available and could be
allocated to these alternatives. Implementing Alternative 2 or 5 would not
include any kiosks and therefore, would not require the allocation of
PAOTs.

Policy 11: Uses of the bodies of water within the
region shall be limited to outdoor water-dependent
uses required to satisfy the goals and policies of
this plan.

Y

Y

Y

Y

Y

The portion of the Upper Truckee River within the study area would continue
to be used for informal water-related recreation under all of the alternatives.

Land Use Goal 3: All new development shall conform to the coefficients of allowable land coverage as set forth in “The Land Capability Classification of the
Lake Tahoe Basin, California-Nevada, a Guide for Planning, Bailey, 1974.”

would be removed and/or relocated to higher capability lands within the
study area under Alternatives 1–4, as allowed per the Regional Plan Goals
and Policies. Coverage also would be added by public access, and
recreation infrastructure elements, Nonetheless, implementing any of the
action alternatives would comply with the Dillingham Settlement
Agreement and Bailey’s Land Capability coefficients. See Section 3.6,
“Geology and Soils, Mineral Resources, and Land Capability and
Coverage,” for additional coverage discussion.

Y

Under all of the action alternatives, the study area would be managed and
available for the public to use and enjoy recreation and natural resources.
All of the action alternatives would improve and redirect most recreational
access away from sensitive habitats with the exception of recreational
development under Alternative 1 related to the bridge and potential effects
to Tahoe yellow cress. Alternative 5, the No Project/No Action Alternative,
would not involve changing land uses in the study area, which would
continue to support informal recreational uses.

Policy 2: No person or persons shall develop
property so as to endanger the public health,
safety, and welfare.

Construction of the action alternatives would likely involve the use of
hazardous materials, such as fuels and other materials, but this would be
short term, and all materials would be used in accordance with applicable
Federal, state, and local laws, including California Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (Cal/OSHA) requirements and manufacturers’
instructions.
No alternatives would involve constructing any buildings for human
occupancy, and no buildings would be demolished as part of any of the
alternatives.

Alt. 5

No alternatives would increase risk of wildland fire, hazards to aviation, or
mosquito vector control.
For these reasons, implementing any of Alternatives 1–5 would not endanger
public health, safety, or welfare.
Noise Goal 1: Single event noise standards shall be attained and maintained.

3.10-5

Policy 3: Motor vehicles and motorcycles shall
comply with the appropriate noise thresholds.

Y

Y

Y

Y

Y

As discussed in Section 3.11, “Noise,” construction traffic under all of the
alternatives would comply with appropriate noise thresholds. None of the
alternatives would result significant increases in noise related to operation.

Policy 4: Off-road vehicle use is prohibited in the
Lake Tahoe region except on specified roads, trails
or designated areas where the impacts can be
mitigated.

Y

Y

Y

Y

Y

Off-road vehicle use is not permitted under any Alternatives or under
existing conditions within the study area.

Policy 6: The plan will permit uses only if they are
consistent with the noise standards. Sound
proofing practices may be required on all
structures containing uses that would otherwise
adversely impact the prescribed noise levels.

Y

Y

Y

Y

Y

Under all alternatives, noise levels created by project activities would be
consistent with applicable noise standards established by the TRPA and the
CSLT. No standards would be exceeded at sensitive receptors, and no new
sensitive receptors would be created.

Natural Hazards Goal 1: Risks from natural hazards (e.g., flood, fire, avalanche, earthquake) will be minimized.

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Land Use

Policy 2: Prohibit construction, grading, and
filling of lands within the 100-year floodplain and
in the area of wave run-up, except as necessary to
implement the goals and policies of the plan.
Require all public utilities, transportation facilities,
and other necessary public uses located in the 100year floodplain and area of wave run-up to be
constructed or maintained to prevent damage from
flooding and to not cause flooding.

Y

Y

Y

Y

Y

None of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) propose any construction,
grading, or filling of lands within the wave run-up of Lake Tahoe.
The action alternatives would include short-term grading and construction
within the 100-year floodplain, but they would produce long-term
improvements in risks from flooding. Alternatives 1, 2, 3, and 4 would
involve removing existing fill in the 100-year floodplain.
Under Alternative 5, existing fill and public uses within the 100-year
floodplain would remain.

Discussion
No habitable structures are proposed under any alternative. Forest
management practices for reducing fire hazards in the study area would be
consistent with acceptable strategies for the maintenance of forest health and
diversity, prevention of fire, protection of water quality, and enhancement of
wildlife habitats.

Water Quality Goal 1: Reduce loads of sediment and algal nutrients to Lake Tahoe; meet sediment and nutrient objectives for tributary streams, surface
runoff, and subsurface runoff, and restore 80% of the disturbed lands.

nutrients to Lake Tahoe; meet sediment and
nutrient objectives for tributary streams, surface
runoff, and sub-surface runoff, and restore 80
percent of the disturbed lands.

Y

Y

Y

NA

Alternatives 1–4 include river and floodplain restoration that would increase
retention of sediment and algal nutrients in the floodplain of the study area,
and thus reduce loads of sediment and nutrients to Lake Tahoe. Alternatives
1–4 would also restore disturbed lands. Alternative 5 (No-Project/NoAction) would not implement river restoration, and existing, disturbed
conditions would continue; however, this alternative not result in new
conditions that would be inconsistent with this policy.

Policy 2: All persons who own land and all public
agencies that manage public lands in the Lake
Tahoe region shall put BMPs in place; maintain
their BMPs; protect vegetation on their land from
unnecessary damage; and restore the disturbed
soils on their land.

Y

Y

Y

Y

NA

Under any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4), any new or
modified facilities would have appropriately designed BMPs installed and
maintained. Additionally, the action alternatives would restore disturbed
soils and would construct additional recreation infrastructure features.
Existing facilities’ BMPs would be maintained under Alternative 5, but
disturbed soils would not be restored, and much of the study area would
remain unprotected from unnecessary damage from recreational use;
however, this alternative would not result in new conditions that would be
inconsistent with this policy.

Policy 3: Application of BMPs to projects shall be
required as a condition of approval for all projects.

Y

Y

Y

Y

NA

All of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would require

As discussed in Section 3.2, “Air Quality,” measures would be implemented
under Alternative 1–4 that would reduce the generation of constructionrelated emissions of ROG, NOX, and PM10 to a less-than-significant level.
None of the alternatives would result in a significant increase in long-term
emissions.
Alternative 5 would not result in short-term or long-term increase in air
quality pollutants.

Water Quality Goal 2: Reduce or eliminate the addition of other pollutants that affect, or potentially affect, water quality in the Tahoe Basin.

would maintain the scenic quality of the study area and would not
substantially degrade the scenic quality of the area.
Although the bridge proposed under Alternative 1 could degrade the scenic
quality within PAS 100, this PAS does not have a scenic restoration area
designation.

Community Design Goal 2: Regional building and community design criteria shall be established to ensure attainment of the scenic thresholds, maintenance
of desired community character, compatibility of land uses, and coordinated project review.

Plan Area Statements
Chapter 11, “Plan Area Statements and Plan Area Maps,” of the TRPA Code of Ordinances requires that all
projects and activities be consistent with the provisions of a particular area’s applicable Plan Area Statement
(PAS). For each plan area, a “statement” is made describing how that particular area should be regulated to
achieve regional environmental and land-use objectives and providing detailed plans and policies for specific
areas of the basin.
The study area is located within six separate PASs: 99 (Al Tahoe), 100 (Truckee Marsh), 102 (Tahoe Keys), 103
(Sierra Tract Commercial), 104 (Highland Woods), and 111 (Tahoe Island). Approximately five acres of the study
area extend beyond the shoreline and are not within any PASs (Exhibit 3.10-1). PAS 100 and PAS 102 together
cover about 90 percent of the study area. The remaining ten percent of the study area is located within PASs 99,
103, 104, and 111. The following PAS descriptions include the land-use classification and management strategy.
The permissible uses for each PAS within the study area are listed in Tables 3.10-2 through 3.10-7. The
establishment of new uses not listed is prohibited within any plan area. Existing uses not listed as permissible
within individual PASs are considered nonconforming uses but may be continued if legally commenced before
July 1, 1987, subject to the provisions of TRPA Code of Ordinances Section 21.5.
PAS 99—Al Tahoe. Approximately 13 acres of the study area are located in PAS 99. The eastern boundary of the
study area is in PAS 99 (Al Tahoe) and includes various parcels along El Dorado Avenue and the lakefront near
Lakeview, Lily, and San Francisco Avenues. The land-use classification for PAS 99 is residential and the
management strategy is redirection. According to the planning statement for PAS 99, “The area should remain
residential with upgrading in those areas identified as substandard.” Specific permissible uses for PAS 99 in
general, and for Shorezone Tolerance District 4 (as listed in the PAS), are provided in Table 3.10-2.
PAS 100—Truckee Marsh. Approximately 527 acres of the study area (including the center of the marsh, the
Upper Truckee River, and Trout Creek) are located within PAS 100 (Truckee Marsh) (TRPA 2005a). The landuse classification for PAS 100 is conservation and the management strategy is maximum regulation. This
management strategy calls for strict regulation to ensure preservation and enhancement of the existing
environment, with little or no additional development of residential, commercial, tourist, recreational, or public
service uses (TRPA Code Section 11.6.2.B.1).
According to the planning statement for PAS 100, “This area should be managed primarily for its natural values
including those management practices which contribute to the quality of fish and wildlife habitats, support
dispersed recreation, and maintain the nutrient catchment capacity of the stream environment zone.”
Specific permissible uses for PAS 100 in general, and for Shorezone Tolerance District 1 (as listed in the PAS),
are provided in Table 3.10-3.
PAS 102—Tahoe Keys. Approximately 67 acres in the western portion of the study area is located within PAS
102 (TRPA 2005c). The portion of PAS 102 within the study area is entirely within the Cove East parcel, and
includes the Lower West Side (LWS) Restoration Area, the Sailing Lagoon, and Cove East Beach. The land-use
classification for PAS 102 is residential and the management strategy is mitigation.
According to the planning statement for PAS 102, “This area should continue to maintain the existing residential
and commercial character of the neighborhood.”
The Sailing Lagoon is located in PAS 102, Special Area (SA) 1, which is a subsection of PAS 102 that includes
the open-water area of the Tahoe Keys Marina. Specific permissible uses for PAS 102 in general, and for
Shorezone Tolerance District 1 (as listed in the PAS), are provided in Table 3.10-4.

Shorezone Tolerance Districts
Three of the plan areas within the study area (PASs 99, 100, and 102) are located within shorezone tolerance
districts.
Shorezone tolerance districts were developed in 1971 by USFS in cooperation with TRPA to provide a relative
quantification of the tolerance of land in the Tahoe Basin to human disturbance (Bailey 1974). TRPA established
eight districts ranging in sensitivity, with 1.0 being the most sensitive designation. (These districts are described
in the Shorezone Ordinance for Lake Tahoe [TRPA 1976].) The designations reflect the distribution of shorezone
resources and features of varying sensitivity and importance. The purpose of the shorezone tolerance districts is to
establish development standards and regulations for construction, marina operations and maintenance, pier
installation, and other shorezone uses specific to the sensitivity of this transitional area.
Chapter 90, “Definitions,” of the TRPA Code of Ordinances defines the shorezone as the land and water area
along the shoreline of the lake consisting of the nearshore, foreshore, and backshore. Chapter 90 further defines
these three components of the shorezone as follows:
►

►

►

Nearshore: The zone extending from the low water elevation of Lake Tahoe (6,223.0 feet Lake Tahoe
Datum) to a lake bottom elevation of 6,193 feet Lake Tahoe Datum, but in any case, a minimum lateral
distance of 350 feet measured from the shoreline (6,229.1 feet Lake Tahoe Datum). In other lakes, the
nearshore extends to a depth of 25 feet below the low water elevation.
Foreshore: The zone of lake level fluctuation that is the area between the high and low water level. (For Lake
Tahoe, the elevations are 6,229.1 feet Lake Tahoe Datum and 6,223.0 feet Lake Tahoe Datum, respectively.)
Backshore: The land area located between the highwater line of the lake and the upland area of instability or
the wave run-up area.

The study area includes approximately 4,240 linear feet of lakefront, which is located within Shorezone Tolerance
Districts 1 and 4. The majority of the lakefront (3,840 linear feet) is in Shorezone Tolerance District 1, and the
remaining 400 linear feet, on the eastern boundary of the study area, is within Shorezone Tolerance District 4. The
following descriptions include the shorezone district’s restrictions on land use applicable to the restoration study
area.
Shorezone Tolerance District 1. Section 83.7.1 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances describes Shorezone Tolerance
District 1 as a “low sandy barrier that separates the lake proper from marshes and wetlands” and as “ecologically
fragile,” and states that “any substantial use or alteration can lead to excessive sedimentation beach erosion and
water turbidity” (TRPA 2011). Permissible uses include the primary uses of safety and navigation facilities, and
accessory uses include fences and shoreline protective structures (see Tables 3.10-2 and 3.10-3). Regulations for
and restrictions on land uses in Shorezone Tolerance District 1, outlined in Section 83.7.2 of the TRPA Code of
Ordinances, are as follows (TRPA 2011):
A. Access to the shoreline shall be restricted to planned footpaths which minimize the impact to the backshore.
B. Vegetation shall not be manipulated or otherwise disturbed except when permitted under Chapter 85
(Development Standards in the Backshore).
C. No drainage or modification of backshore wetlands shall be permitted.

D. New development in the backshore of a Shorezone Tolerance District 1 shall be regulated in accordance with
the regulations in this Code for stream environment zones.
E. Replacement of existing land coverage in the backshore of a Shorezone Tolerance District 1 shall be in
accordance with the regulations for replacing existing land coverage in stream environment zones.
Shorezone Tolerance District 4. Section 83.9.1.A of the TRPA Code of Ordinances describes Shorezone
Tolerance District 4 as “volcanic rock shorelines with moderate potential for erosion” (TRPA 2011). The
permissible uses (primary and accessory) for Shorezone Tolerance District 4 within Plan Area Statement 99 are
listed in Table 3.10-2. Regulations for and restrictions on land uses within Shorezone Tolerance District 4
outlined in Section 83.9.2 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances are described below (TRPA 2011).
A. Permitted development or continued use may be conditioned upon installation and maintenance of vegetation
to stabilized backshore areas and protection of existing cliffs from accelerated erosion.
B. Projects shall not be permitted in the backshore unless TRPA finds that such project is unlikely to require the
cliff area to be mechanically stabilized or that the project will not accelerate cliff crumbling, beach loss or
erosion.
C. Access to the shoreline shall be restricted to stabilized access ways that minimize the impact to the backshore.
D. Access to buoys shall be designed to cause the least possible environmental harm to the foreshore and
backshore.
E. Access to piers, floating platforms and boat ramps shall be designed to cause the least possible alteration to
the natural backshore.
Environmental Improvement Program
The Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) includes a list of specific projects throughout the Basin that are
needed to attain and maintain the thresholds (TRPA 1997). EIP-listed projects within the study area include 560,
650, 981, and 1002.
EIP Project #560 includes implementation of the proposed project and the Lower West Side Project to restore the
mouth of the Upper Truckee River and associated floodplain and was previously funded as EIP Project #1002.
EIP Project #650 calls for restoring 40 acres of SEZ on lands that have been acquired by the public, and EIP
Project #981 calls for developing a protection plan and constructing protective structures, along Cove East
beaches.
Tahoe Keys Marina Master Plan
A master plan has been adopted by TRPA for the Tahoe Keys Marina (TRPA 2002). The objectives of the Tahoe
Keys Marina Master Plan are to facilitate obtaining necessary permits and environmental certifications, executing
a land exchange with the Conservancy and the Tahoe Keys Property Owners Association (TKPOA), and
constructing proposed projects.
City of South Lake Tahoe
General Plan
The City of South Lake Tahoe 2030 General Plan (City General Plan) was adopted in 2011. The City General
Plan designates the land use in the study area as Conservation. This designation provides for the permanent
preservation of natural resources, habitat protection, watershed management, public and quasi‐public uses, areas

that contain public health and safety hazards such as floodways, and areas containing environmentally sensitive
features.
Lake Tahoe Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan
The Lake Tahoe Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) establishes planning boundaries for the Lake
Tahoe Airport and defines compatible types and patterns of future land uses that might occur in the area
surrounding the airport (CSLT 2007). The purpose of the CLUP is to provide the Lake Tahoe Airport area with
compatibility guidelines for height, noise, and safety.
The CLUP designates airport safety zones to the land surrounding the airport to minimize the number of people
exposed to aircraft crash hazards. The southeastern portion of the study area between the Highland Woods
subdivision and Trout Creek is within the approach/departure zone. The approach/departure zone, which is
located under the takeoff and landing slopes for each runway, extends outward for 5,000 feet from Runway 36
(with a width of 500–1,500 feet) and 10,000 feet from Runway 18 (with a width of 1,010–3,500 feet), and is less
restrictive than the clear zone.
Conservation Strategy for Tahoe Yellow Cress
The Conservation Strategy for Tahoe Yellow Cress (Rorippa subumbellata) is a regional conservation strategy for
Tahoe yellow cress, a state-listed endangered species that grows in the study area (Pavlik, Murphy, and TYCTAG
2002). The conservation strategy is described in Section 3.4, “Biological Resources: Vegetation and Wildlife.”

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Study Area
The study area for the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project is approximately 633 acres, and
includes parcels owned by the Conservancy, other public agencies, and private landowners (Exhibit 1-2 in
Chapter 1). It is generally bounded by U.S. 50 and the Highland Woods subdivision on the south, the Al Tahoe
subdivision on the east, and Tahoe Island/Sky Meadows and Tahoe Keys subdivisions on the west. The study area
includes the downstream reaches of Trout Creek and the Upper Truckee River, adjacent wetland and uplands
habitats, more than three-fourths of a mile of Lake Tahoe shoreline, and the LWS Restoration Area (located in the
northwest portion of the study area, just east of the Tahoe Keys Marina). Land uses and land use policies in the
study area are heavily influenced by natural resource values because of the unique habitat qualities and natural
setting provided by the study area. For a complete description of the natural resource land uses in the study area
see Section 3.4, “Biological Resources: Vegetation and Wildlife.” The study area is very accessible and is used
extensively by the public. A number of streets in adjacent neighborhoods end at the boundary of the study area,
and numerous user-created trails begin at these access points and extend into the study area. In addition, an
improved and Conservancy-maintained pedestrian trail connects East Venice Drive and Cove East Beach. The
study area is also accessible by boat from Lake Tahoe and by canoes, kayaks, and rafts from the Upper Truckee
River. Visitors use the study area for numerous informal, dispersed recreation activities, including: rafting,
kayaking, canoeing, walking, jogging, dog walking, wildlife viewing, photography and sightseeing, swimming,
fishing, bicycling, and beach use.
Residential Subdivisions Adjacent to the Study Area
The study area is bordered by four residential subdivisions: Al Tahoe, Highland Woods, Tahoe Island, and Tahoe
Keys. These subdivisions are described below.
The Al Tahoe residential subdivision is located immediately east of and adjacent to the study area. The
subdivision contains a mixture of older and newer homes (single-family and multi-family dwellings), with some
commercial uses within the subdivision near U.S. 50. The subdivision is served by both Class II and Class III

bicycle trails. A Class I bicycle path also connects this subdivision to U.S. 50 and the Highland Woods
subdivision.
The Highland Woods residential subdivision is located adjacent to the southern portion of the study area, between
the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek. The residential uses consist primarily of single-family dwellings with a
few multi-family dwellings within the subdivision. A Class I bicycle path provides access to this subdivision from
the study area at the end of Rubicon Trail. As the bicycle path continues into the subdivision, it transitions to a
Class III bicycle path. A Class I bicycle path extends from this subdivision toward the Tahoe Island and Tahoe
Keys subdivisions (as shown in Exhibit 2-1 in Chapter 2).
The Tahoe Island subdivision is located southwest of the study area. The residential uses consist primarily of
single-family dwellings, with a few multi-family dwellings in the subdivision. A Class III bicycle path serves the
subdivision, and a Class I path extends between this subdivision and Highland Woods. A Class II bicycle path on
Tahoe Keys Boulevard extends into PAS 102.
The Tahoe Keys development contains multi-family and single-family houses and condominiums. This area also
includes the Tahoe Keys Village commercial and professional center and the Tahoe Keys Marina. The
subdivision contains Class II and Class III bicycle paths.
All of the residential subdivisions have access points leading into the study area. Some of these access points and
trails are established and recognized by the Conservancy while others are user-created.
Sierra Tract Commercial / U.S. Highway 50 Corridor
A variety of commercial uses exist within the U.S. 50 corridor: restaurants, retail, gas stations, professional
offices, hotels, hardware/lumber, and more. Existing commercial uses adjacent to the study area, near the U.S. 50
bridge at the Upper Truckee River, include Carrow’s Restaurant, Motel 6, and Tahoe Amusement Park. Meek’s
Lumber and the Tahoe Center shopping center are located near the U.S. 50 bridge at Trout Creek.
Tahoe Keys Marina
The Tahoe Keys Marina includes mixed-use commercial development (restaurant, meeting rooms, retail shops),
marina facilities such as boat slips, facilities for fueling vessels, a boat launching area, offices, and parking. The
marina serves residents of and visitors to the Tahoe Basin. The LWS Restoration Area is located immediately
west of and adjacent to the Tahoe Keys Marina parking lot.
Lake Tahoe Airport
The Lake Tahoe Airport is located approximately one mile south of the study area along U.S. 50. The Lake Tahoe
Airport is owned and operated by the CSLT. The airport is equipped to serve as a commercial air carrier/general
aviation airport, although it does not currently support commercial flights and there is no commercial operator at the
airport. The airport has one north-south asphalt runaway, which is 8,544 feet long by 150 feet wide. The Lake Tahoe
Airport is adjacent to the Upper Truckee River upstream of the study area. The southeastern portion of the study area
between the Highland Woods subdivision and Trout Creek is within the approach/departure zone. (See Section 3.7,
“Human Health/Risk of Upset,” for additional information on the Lake Tahoe Airport and airspace safety.)

CEQA Criteria
Under CEQA, an alternative was determined to result in a significant effect related to land use if it would:
►

►

►

►

►

►

physically divide an established community (CEQA 1);
conflict with any applicable land-use plan, policy, or regulation of an agency with jurisdiction over the project
adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect (CEQA 2); or
conflict with any applicable habitat conservation plan or natural community conservation plan (CEQA 3).
conflict with existing zoning for, or cause rezoning of, forest land (as defined in Public Resources Code
Section 12220(g)) or timberland (as defined in Public Resources Code Section 4526) (CEQA 4).
result in the loss of forest land or conversion of forest land to non-forest use (CEQA 5).
involve other changes in the existing environment which, due to their location or nature, could result in
conversion of Farmland to non-agricultural use or conversion of forest land to nonforest use (CEQA 6).

NEPA Criteria
An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the
environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the proposed action. Under NEPA, the significance
of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account
under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are
encompassed by the CEQA criteria used for this analysis. NEPA requires documentation and discussion of any
beneficial effects of a project in addition to its negative impacts. Where appropriate, these beneficial effects are
discussed and called out specifically for the purposes of NEPA in the following impact analysis.
TRPA Criteria
Based on TRPA’s Initial Environmental Checklist, an alternative was determined to have a significant impact
related to land use if it would:
►

►

include uses that are not listed as permissible uses in the applicable PAS, adopted community plan, or master
plan (TRPA 1); or
expand or intensify an existing nonconforming use (TRPA 2).

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
The focus of this analysis is on land-use impacts that would result from implementation of the proposed
alternatives. Evaluation of potential impacts was based on consultation with appropriate agencies and a review of
the planning documents pertaining to the study area:
►

►

Regional Plan for the Lake Tahoe Basin (TRPA 2004);
TRPA PASs, 99 (Al Tahoe), 100 (Truckee Marsh), 102 (Tahoe Keys), 103 (Sierra Tract–Commercial), 104
(Highland Woods), and 111 (Tahoe Island) (TRPA 2005a, 2005b, 2005c, 2005d, 2005e, 2005f);

►

2030 General Plan (CSLT 2011);

►

EFFECTS NOT DISCUSSED FURTHER IN THIS EIR/EIS/EIS
Changes in zoning and forest land effects (CEQA 4, 5, 6; TRPA 1)—No environmental impacts would occur

IMPACT ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
Alternative 1: Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
IMPACT
3.10-1
(Alt. 1)

Potential to Physically Divide an Established Community. (CEQA 1; NEPA) Implementation of Alternative
1 would not create a physical division within an established community. The restoration features of Alternative
1 that would modify the river, floodplain, and lagoon areas would not adversely affect accessibility of the area,
existing transportation, or create a barrier to access within and through the community. Some of the proposed
public access and recreation infrastructure elements would benefit the neighboring community, specifically the
bridge and boardwalks, would provide transportation connectivity. This would be a beneficial effect. This
impact would be less than significant.

Restoration components of Alternative 1 would modify the Upper Truckee River and associated floodplain in the
study area, and restore lagoon and dune habitats. These restoration components would include raising and
reconfiguring a portion of the river’s main channel, reconfiguring two sections of split channel, reducing the
capacity of the river mouth, and changing the hydrologic connectivity of the Sailing Lagoon. These restoration
components would be modifications to an existing natural feature and would not adversely affect accessibility of
the study area, nor would they hinder existing transportation or access within or through the community.
Public access and recreation infrastructure features of Alternative 1 would include kiosks, pedestrian trails and
bicycle paths, viewing platforms, boardwalks, and a bridge over the Upper Truckee River. The kiosks, viewing
platforms, and pedestrian trail and bicycle paths would not reduce accessibility to the study area, nor would they
hinder existing transportation access within and through the community. On the contrary, the bridge and
connected boardwalk features would provide new transportation connectivity within the community. These public
access features would enhance passage over an existing natural physical barrier (the Upper Truckee River) and
would therefore improve connection between existing neighborhoods (Al Tahoe and Tahoe Keys) via alternate
modes of transportation.
In summary, neither the restoration components nor the public access and recreation infrastructure components of
Alternative 1 would physically divide an established community because these components would either be
modifications to existing features or would not create a barrier to connectivity to surrounding communities. In
addition, some of the public access components would increase connectivity of established communities by
providing additional access corridors through the study area allowing better connectivity of the surrounding
community. This impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.10-2
(Alt. 1)

Potential Conflict with Land-Use Plans, Policies, or Regulations Intended to Protect the Environment.
(CEQA 2; TRPA 2) Implementation of Alternative 1 would not conflict with applicable plans, policies, or
regulations intended to protect the environment. Land uses under Alternative 1 would either be consistent with
the permissible land uses of applicable PASs or a special-use permit would be obtained prior to construction
ensuring consistency. Land use under Alternative 1 would also be consistent with the goals and objectives of
the City General Plan, the Tahoe Keys Marina Master Plan, the TRPA Regional Plan, EIP, and the compatible
land uses identified in the CLUP for the approach/departure zone, which extends into the southeastern corner
of the study area. This impact would be less than significant.

Land Use

The permissible uses within the seven applicable plan areas (as described within the corresponding PASs) are
listed in Tables 3.10-2 through 3.10-7. Table 3.10-8 presents permissible uses related to the project for each of the
seven PASs, SEZ restoration and a wide range of vegetation and habitat management activities are identified as
permissible uses and in all plan areas riding and hiking trails are also a permissible use. The more intensive
components of Alternative 1 (i.e., kiosks, boardwalks, viewing platforms) would either be constructed in a PAS
that allows recreational development (PAS 102) or transportation routes (PAS 100). Because all of the proposed
uses are listed as allowable uses, Alternative 1 would not conflict with the applicable PASs.
Applicable land-use regulations and restrictions in Shorezone Tolerance Districts 1 and 4 include limiting shoreline
access to planned footpaths and stabilized access ways, and in District 1, replacement of existing land coverage in
the backshore in accordance with the regulations for SEZs. Alternative 1 would include observation platforms,
boardwalks, pedestrian trails, and bicycle paths; however, any new access would be a stabilized access way, and
would provide planned pedestrian trails that would discourage and reduce public access into sensitive areas.
Alternative 1 is consistent with the conservation land use category of the City General Plan. In particular,
Alternative 1 supports conservation, environmental improvements and the correction of past land-use
deficiencies. Regarding specific land-use designations, the CSLT has adopted the TRPA permissible uses for each
plan area. In addition, the components included as part of Alternative 1 would be consistent with the TRPA
Regional Plan goals and policies, as discussed in Table 3.10-1.
The southeast corner of the study area is in the approach/departure zone of the Lake Tahoe Airport. Land uses
designated as compatible for this zone include most recreation uses (except for camping and participant sports
facilities) and the full range of resource management uses, including SEZ restoration and vegetation management.
Thus, the restoration, public access and recreation infrastructure features of Alternative 1 would be considered
compatible land uses by the CLUP and would not conflict with the CLUP.
In addition, Alternative 1 would not impair navigation within the Upper Truckee River that is under the
jurisdiction of the CSLC, and the Conservancy would obtain a State Lands Lease, if determined necessary by
CSLC, to ensure consistency with CSLC policies and regulations.
Implementation of Alternative 1 would also include implementation of EIP Projects #560, 650, 981, and 1002
described above, which would further implementation of the EIP.
In summary, Alternative 1 would not conflict with applicable land-use plans, policies, or regulations intended to
protect the environment, and in some cases would further implementation of goals or policies of the land use
plans. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.10-3
(Alt. 1)

Potential Conflict with Regional Conservation Strategy for Tahoe Yellow Cress. (CEQA 3) The regional,
multi-agency, conservation strategy for Tahoe yellow cress includes specific actions to be implemented in the
study area. The Conservancy has prepared a Tahoe yellow cress management plan for the study area that
incorporates these applicable actions of the regional conservation strategy. Alternative 1 would implement
these actions but would also construct a boardwalk and increase recreational use in Tahoe yellow cress
habitat that the regional conservation strategy identifies as a core site for conservation. The actions in the
Conservancy’s management plan would not be sufficient to fully mitigate the effects of the increase in
recreational use. Therefore, this impact would be significant.

Alternative 1 would construct a boardwalk close to potential and occupied Tahoe yellow cress habitat east of the
Upper Truckee River. Consequently, Alternative 1 would increase the number of recreational users and associated
disturbance throughout this habitat, which would adversely affect Tahoe yellow cress. These effects on Tahoe
yellow cress are described in greater detail in Section 3.4, “Biological Resources: Vegetation and Wildlife” in the
discussion of Impacts 3.4-3, 3.4-4, and 3.4-5.

To attain long-term conservation of Tahoe yellow cress, the regional, multi-agency conservation strategy for
Tahoe yellow cress (Conservation Strategy for Tahoe Yellow Cress [Rorippa subumbellata] [Pavlik, Murphy, and
TYCTAG 2002]) establishes six goals, 14 objectives, and a number of specific actions. This regional plan
identifies occupied and potential Tahoe yellow cress habitat east of the Upper Truckee River as a core site for
conservation, and habitat west of the river as a medium-priority restoration site. For the study area, the
Conservancy has prepared a Tahoe yellow cress management plan that incorporates the applicable actions of the
regional conservation strategy (e.g., maintaining an exclosure and conducting monitoring) (Conservancy 2008)
and would be implemented as a component of Alternative 1. However, these actions would not be sufficient to
fully mitigate the effects of increased recreational use of Tahoe yellow cress habitat. (See the discussion of Impact
3.4-5 [Alt. 1].) Therefore, Alternative 1 would conflict with several goals of the regional conservation strategy for
Tahoe yellow cress, including Goal 1, Protect Occupied Habitat and Potentially Suitable Habitat That Does/Could
Support Natural Populations; Goal 2, Improve Tahoe Yellow Cress Populations; and Goal 3, Promote Conditions
that Favor a Positive Metapopulation Dynamic.
The goals and objectives include protecting occupied and potentially suitable habitat at core and priority sites,
improving Tahoe yellow cress populations, and promoting conditions that favor a positive metapopulation
dynamic. Therefore, this impact would be significant.
All feasible measures to reduce effects on Tahoe yellow cress, and thus reduce the potential conflict with the
regional conservation strategy, have been included in the Conservancy’s Tahoe yellow cress management plan for
the study area, which would be implemented as a component of Alternative 1. Therefore, this impact would be
significant and unavoidable.

Potential to Physically Divide an Established Community. (CEQA 1) Implementation of Alternative 2 would
not create a physical division within an established community. The restoration features of Alternative 2 that
would modify the river, floodplain, and lagoon areas would not adversely affect accessibility of the area,
existing transportation, or access within and through the community. New public access and recreation
infrastructure features also would not adversely affect accessibility of the area, existing transportation, or
access within and through the community. This impact would be less than significant.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.10-1 (Alt. 1) above. Alternative 2 would not provide the new neighborhood
connections associated with the bridge and boardwalks that would improve connectivity under Alternative 1;
however, Alternative 2 would include similar restoration, public access, and recreation infrastructure features as
Alternative 1. Modifications to the channel and floodplain of the Upper Truckee River, lagoon and dune
restoration, a fishing platform, and pedestrian trails under Alternative 2 are not expected to physically divide any
established communities because these features would not create barriers that would affect accessibility through
the surrounding communities. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

To attain long-term conservation of Tahoe yellow cress, the regional, multi-agency conservation strategy for
Tahoe yellow cress (Conservation Strategy for Tahoe Yellow Cress [Rorippa subumbellata] [Pavlik, Murphy, and
TYCTAG 2002]) establishes six goals, 14 objectives, and a number of specific actions. For the study area, the
Conservancy has prepared a Tahoe yellow cress management plan that incorporates the applicable actions of this
regional conservation strategy (Conservancy 2008). The actions implemented at East Barton and Barton beaches
for Tahoe yellow cress would include annual monitoring and adjustment of the location and design of an
exclosure to prevent trampling of Tahoe yellow cress plants by visitors and their dogs. Alternative 2 would
implement all applicable actions identified by the regional conservation strategy for Tahoe yellow cress, and the
other features of Alternative 2 would not conflict with the goals, objectives, or actions of the regional
conservation plan. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

the study area would not occur under Alternative 5. Under Alternative 5, EIP projects (Nos. 560, 650, 981, and
1002) necessary to attain, maintain, or surpass multiple thresholds, would not be implemented. However,
these are only a subset of projects identified within the EIP as potential means for attainment of the various
Threshold Standards, specifically the water quality and SEZ restoration objectives. Therefore, implementation
of Alternative 5 would not conflict with but would also not assist with the attainment of the goals of the TRPA

floodplain of the Upper Truckee River in the study area would not occur for the foreseeable future and restoration
of the river and floodplain in the study area has been identified as an EIP project (#560) necessary to attain,
maintain, or surpass multiple thresholds. In addition, implementation of EIP Projects #650, 981, and 1002
described above, would not occur under Alternative 5. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 5 would not

3.11 NOISE
This section includes a description of acoustic fundamentals, existing ambient noise conditions, applicable noise
regulations, and an analysis of potential short- and long-term noise impacts associated with implementation of
Alternatives 1–5. Mitigation measures are not needed because potentially significant adverse noise impacts would
not occur for any alternatives. Consistency with TRPA goals and policies is presented in Section 3.2, “Land Use,”
Table 3.2-1. The project’s effects on thresholds are described in Section 4.5, “Consequences for Environmental
Threshold Carrying Capacities.” Cumulative noise impacts are addressed in Section 3.18, “Cumulative Impacts.”

3.11.1

AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

REGULATORY SETTING
Federal, state, and local governments have established noise standards and guidelines to protect citizens from
potential hearing damage and various other adverse physiological and social effects associated with noise. The
federal government regulates noise levels in the workplace, near aircraft, and for certain products. The State of
California regulates vehicular and freeway noise affecting sensitive land uses, sets standards to control sound
transmission and occupational noise, and identifies noise insulation standards and airport noise/land use
compatibility criteria. Local communities generally regulate compatibility between land uses and noise levels by
establishing allowable noise levels on private property and levels associated with the use of certain types of sources.
The applicable standards and guidelines for the proposed alternatives are discussed below.
Federal
To address the human response to groundborne vibration, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) of the U.S.
Department of Transportation has set forth guidelines for maximum-acceptable vibration criteria for different types
of land uses. These criteria are 65 vibration decibels (VdB) referenced to 1 microinch per second (μin/sec) and based
on the root mean square (RMS) velocity amplitude for land uses where low ambient vibration is essential for interior
operations (e.g., hospitals, high-tech manufacturing, and laboratory facilities); 80 VdB for residential uses and
buildings where people normally sleep; and 83 VdB for institutional land uses with primarily daytime operations
(e.g., schools, churches, clinics, and offices) (FTA 2006:Chapters 10 and 12).
Standards have also been established to address the potential for groundborne vibration to cause structural damage to
buildings. These standards were developed by the Committee of Hearing, Bio Acoustics, and Bio Mechanics
(CHABA) at the request of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (FTA 2006: Chapters 7 to 13). For
fragile structures, CHABA recommends a maximum limit of 0.25 inch per second (in/sec) peak particle velocity
(PPV) (FTA 2006).
State
The California Governor’s Office of Planning and Research (OPR) published the State of California General Plan
Guidelines (OPR 2003), which provides guidance for the acceptability of projects within specific community noise
equivalent level (CNEL) contours. Table 3.11-1 summarizes acceptable and unacceptable community noise
exposure limits for various land use categories based on State of California standards. Generally, residential uses are
considered acceptable in areas where exterior noise levels do not exceed 60 A-weighted decibels (dBA) CNEL. (See
“Sound and the Human Ear” and “Noise Descriptors” in the “Environmental Setting” section below for descriptions
of the dBA and CNEL concepts, respectively.) Residential uses are normally unacceptable in areas exceeding 70
dBA CNEL and conditionally acceptable within 55–70 dBA CNEL. Schools are normally acceptable in areas up to
70 dBA CNEL and normally unacceptable in areas exceeding 70 dBA CNEL. Commercial uses are normally
acceptable in areas up to 70 dBA CNEL. Between 67.5 and 77.5 dBA CNEL, commercial uses are conditionally
acceptable, depending on the noise insulation features and the noise reduction requirements. The guidelines also
present adjustment factors that may be used to arrive at noise-acceptability standards that reflect the particular
community’s noise-control goals, sensitivity to noise, and assessment of the relative importance of noise issues.

Tahoe Regional Planning Agency
Goals and Policies
The Goals and Policies document of the 1987 Regional Plan (TRPA 2006) establishes an overall framework for
development and environmental conservation in the Lake Tahoe region. Chapter II (Land Use Element) of the
Goals and Policies document considers seven subelements, including the Noise subelement.
The Goals and Policies document presents the overall approach to meeting TRPA’s environmental carrying
capacity thresholds (thresholds) (see “Thresholds” below). The following goals and policies in the Noise
subelement of the Goals and Policies are relevant to the project:
►

Goal 1. Single Event Noise Standards shall be attained and maintained. People can be annoyed by a
specific noise source. Thresholds were adopted that apply to aircraft, boats, motor vehicles, off-road vehicles,
and snowmobiles to reduce impacts associated with single noise events.
•

Policy 3: Motor vehicles and motorcycle shall comply with the appropriate noise thresholds.

•

Policy 5: The use of snowmobiles will be restricted to designated areas.

•

►

Policy 6: The plan will permit uses only if they are consistent with the noise standards. Sound proofing
practices may be required on all structures containing uses that would otherwise adversely impact the
prescribed noise levels.

Goal 2. Community noise equivalent levels shall be attained and maintained. CNEL thresholds were
adopted to reduce the annoyance associated with cumulative noise events on people and wildlife. In the Lake
Tahoe Basin, the main sources of noise are attributed to the major transportation corridors and the Lake Tahoe
Airport in South Lake Tahoe. Therefore, the policies are directed towards reducing the transmission of noise
from those sources. The CNEL thresholds will be attained upon implementation of the following policies.
•

Policy 1: Transmission of noise from transportation corridors shall be reduced. The noise associated with
the transportation corridors can be decreased by reducing the number of trips and by installing mitigation
measures. Trip reduction will be accomplished by the transit improvements identified in the
Transportation Element. Ordinances will establish specific site design criteria for projects to help reduce
the transmission of noise from the transportation corridors. The design criteria will also be incorporated
into the water quality and transportation improvement programs. The mitigation measures may include
setbacks, earth berms, and barriers.

•

Policy 3: TRPA will further define CNELs for wilderness and roadless areas, and for critical wildlife
habitat areas.

The Noise subelement also establishes the following CNEL values for transportation corridors:
►
►
►

U.S. Highway 50 (U.S. 50) (65 dBA)
State Routes (SRs) 89, 207, 28, 267, and 431 (55 dBA)
Lake Tahoe Airport (60 dBA)

The CNEL values for transportation corridors override the land use–based CNELs and are limited to an area
within 300 feet from the edge of the road (“edge of pavement”). The airport CNEL value applies to areas affected
by approved flight plans.
Plan Area Statements
The study area is located within six separate PASs: 099 (Al Tahoe), PAS 100 (Truckee Marsh), 102 (Tahoe
Keys), PAS 103 (Sierra Tract Commercial), PAS 104 (Highland Woods), and PAS 111 (Tahoe Island) (see
Exhibit 3.10-1, “Plan Area Statements in the Study Area and Vicinity,” in Section 3.10, “Land Use”). The most
conservative CNEL for the applicable PASs is 50 dBA CNEL in PAS 100. The maximum CNEL within the study
area is 65 dBA CNEL for the U.S. 50 corridor.
Code of Ordinances
Chapter 68 (Noise Limitations) of the TRPA Code of Ordinances establishes noise limitations for single noise events
from aircraft, marine craft, motor vehicles, motorcycles, off-road vehicles, and over-snow vehicles (TRPA 2011).
Section 68.3 states that TRPA shall use the maximum level recorded on a noise meter, Lmax (maximum noise level),
for measuring single noise events. The noise levels set forth in Subsection 68.3.1 are the maximum permissible noise
levels for the types of operations listed, unless specifically exempted under Section 68.9. Section 68.4 states that
TRPA shall use CNELs to measure community noise levels, and the PASs shall set forth CNELs that shall not be
exceeded by any one activity or combination of activities. In addition, community noise levels shall not exceed
levels existing on August 26, 1982, where such levels are known. The CNELs set forth in the PASs are based on the
land use classification, the presence of transportation corridors, and the applicable threshold.
Chapter 68 also provides guidance on the measurement of noise levels (Section 68.5), noise monitoring (Section
68.6), and performance standards (Section 68.7). The noise limitations established in Chapter 68 of the TRPA

Code of Ordinances do not apply to noise from TRPA-approved construction or maintenance projects, or the
demolition of structures, provided that such activities are limited to the hours between 8:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m.
Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities
Noise thresholds are a combination of single-event Lmax standards for specific sources (aircraft [Threshold N-1],
motor vehicles, off-road vehicles, boats, snowmobiles [Threshold N-2]) and numerical CNEL values for various
land use categories and transportation corridors [Threshold N-3]). Tables 3.11-2 and 3.11-3 summarize
Thresholds N-1 and N-2 for single events (Lmax) and Threshold N-3 for community noise events. In addition,
Threshold N-3 contains the following policy statement (TRPA 2002):
It shall be the policy of the TRPA Governing Board in the development of the Regional Plan to
define, locate, and establish CNEL levels for transportation corridors.

El Dorado County
General Plan Noise Element
The following goals, objectives, policies, and criteria in the Noise Element of the El Dorado County General Plan
(El Dorado County 2004) are relevant to the project:
►

Goal 6.5: Acceptable Noise Levels. Ensure that County residents are not subjected to noise beyond
acceptable levels.
•

Objective 6.5.1: Protection of Noise-Sensitive Development. Protect existing noise-sensitive
developments (e.g., hospitals, schools, churches, and residential) from new uses that would generate noise
levels incompatible with those uses and, conversely, discourage noise-sensitive uses from locating near
sources of high noise levels.

•

Policy 6.5.1.1: Where noise-sensitive land uses are proposed in areas exposed to existing or projected
exterior noise levels exceeding the levels specified in Table 3.11-4 or the performance standards of Table
3.11-5, an acoustical analysis shall be required as part of the environmental review process so that noise
mitigation may be included in the project design.

Policy 6.5.1.2: Where proposed non-residential land uses are likely to produce noise levels exceeding the
performance standards of Table 3.11-5 at existing or planned noise-sensitive uses, an acoustical analysis
shall be required as part of the environmental review process so that noise mitigation may be included in
the project design.

In Communities and Rural Centers, where the location of outdoor activity areas is not clearly defined, the exterior-noise-level standard
shall be applied to the property line of the receiving land use. For residential uses with front yards facing the identified noise source, an
exterior noise level criterion of 65 dB Ldn shall be applied at the building façade, in addition to a 60-dB Ldn criterion at the outdoor activity
area. In Rural Regions, an exterior-noise-level criterion of 60 dB Ldn shall be applied at a 100-foot radius from the residence unless it is
within Platted Lands where the underlying land use designation is consistent with the Community Region densities, in which case the 65­
dB Ldn may apply. The 100-foot radius applies to properties that are 5 acres and larger; the balance will fall under the property-line
requirement.

Each of the noise levels specified above shall be lowered by 5 dB for simple tone noises, noises consisting primarily of speech or music, or
for recurring impulsive noises. These noise-level standards do not apply to residential units established in conjunction with industrial or
commercial uses (e.g., caretaker dwellings).
El Dorado County can impose noise level standards that are up to 5 dB less than those specified above based upon determination of
existing low ambient noise levels in the vicinity of the project site.
In Community areas the exterior noise level standard shall be applied to the property line of the receiving property. In Rural Areas the
exterior noise level standard shall be applied at a point 100 feet away from the residence. The above standards shall be measured only
on property containing a noise-sensitive land use as defined in Objective 6.5.1. This measurement standard may be amended to provide
for measurement at the boundary of a recorded noise easement between all effected property owners and approved by El Dorado
County.
* For the purposes of the Noise Element, transportation noise sources are defined as traffic on public roadways, railroad line operations,
and aircraft in flight. Control of noise from these sources is preempted by federal and state regulations. Control of noise from facilities of
regulated public facilities is preempted by California Public Utilities Commission regulations. All other noise sources are subject to local
regulations. Nontransportation noise sources may include industrial operations; outdoor recreation facilities; heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning units; schools; hospitals; commercial land uses; and other outdoor land uses.
Source: El Dorado County 2004:Table 6-2

B. Develop and employ procedures to monitor compliance with the standards of the Noise Element after
completion of projects where noise mitigation measures were required.
C. The zoning ordinance shall be amended to provide that noise standards will be applied to ministerial
projects with the exception of single-family residential building permits if not in areas governed by
the Airports Comprehensive Land Use Plans. (See Objective 6.5.2.)

7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, and 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on weekends, and on
federally recognized holidays. Exceptions are allowed if it can be shown that construction beyond these
times is necessary to alleviate traffic congestion and safety hazards.
Policy 6.5.1.12: When determining the significance of impacts and appropriate mitigation for new
development projects, the following criteria shall be taken into consideration.
A. Where existing or projected future traffic noise levels are less than 60 dBA Ldn at the outdoor activity
areas of residential uses, an increase of more than 5 dBA Ldn caused by a new transportation noise
source will be considered significant;

unlawful for any person to willfully make, emit, or transmit or cause to be made, emitted, or transmitted any
loud and raucous noise upon or from any public highway or public thoroughfare or from any aircraft of any

City of South Lake Tahoe
Regarding noise, the CSLT has four goals with a total of seven objectives (CSLT 1999a). These goals and
objectives are listed below.
►

►

Goal 1: To reduce or minimize the scale of nuisance created by noise affecting residents, businesses and
visitors.
•

Objective 1: Establish standards for ambient community noise environment.

•

Objective 2: Reduce levels of noise created by construction equipment.

•

Objective 3: Provide for early review and identification of potential noise concerns associated with
development.

•

Objective 4: Provide as noise-free an environment within residences as possible.

Goal 2: The City will support, in its role as operator of the Lake Tahoe Airport, the maximum utilization of
the airport facility and its services for the benefit of the entire community, within the noise standards and
environmental constraints, consistent with the Circulation Element.
•

►

Goal 3: Noise levels along major vehicular corridors should not affect the general health and welfare of
residents and visitors.
•

►

Objective 1: The City will establish guidelines for the operation and future expanded utilization of the
airport facilities and services within noise standards and environmental constraints, consistent the
Circulation Element.

Objective 1: Provide for the implementation of appropriate noise levels along major vehicular corridors.

Goal 4: Minimize noise to residents in close proximity to industrially zoned areas.
•

Objective 1: Restrict industrial activities to appropriate PAS.

The CSLT has these goals and objectives regarding noise; however, because TRPA has jurisdictional powers over
the entirety of the CSLT, CSLT has deferred some government powers to TRPA to prevent conflicts and
redundancy. Noise control is one such jurisdiction that the CSLT has deferred to TRPA. In City Code S5-18, the
CSLT legally defers the responsibility of noise regulation to TRPA (CSLT 1999b).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Acoustic Fundamentals
Noise is generally defined as sound that is loud, disagreeable, unexpected, or unwanted. Sound, as described in
more detail below, is mechanical energy transmitted in the form of a wave, because of a disturbance or vibration,
and as any pressure variation in air that the human ear can detect.

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Noise

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

Sound Characteristics
Frequency, wavelength, and amplitude are characteristics typically used to describe sound. Sound is in the form of
a sinusoidal longitudinal wave. Amplitude is defined as the maximum positive displacement from the undisturbed
position of the medium to the top of the wave (crest). The amplitude of the wave determines the loudness of the
sound. The frequency is determined by the number of wave cycles per second. The frequency is used to describe
the pitch of the sound and is the reciprocal of the wave period, which is defined as the duration of one cycle. The
wavelength is the distance between two successive crests. An inverse relationship exists between frequency and
wavelength; thus, as frequency increases wavelength shortens, and vice versa (Caltrans 1998).
Sound and the Human Ear
Because of the ability of the human ear to detect a wide range of sound pressure fluctuations, sound pressure
levels are expressed in logarithmic units called decibels (dB). The sound pressure level in decibels is calculated
by taking the logarithm of the ratio between the actual sound pressure and the reference sound pressure squared.
The reference sound pressure is considered the absolute hearing threshold (Caltrans 1998).
In addition, because the human ear is not equally sensitive to all sound frequencies, a specific frequency
dependent rating scale was devised to relate noise to human sensitivity. An A-weighted decibel (dBA) scale
performs this compensation by discriminating against frequencies in a manner approximating the sensitivity of the
human ear. The basis for compensation is the faintest sound audible to the average ear at the frequency of
maximum sensitivity. The dBA scale has been chosen by most authorities for purposes of environmental noise
regulation. Exhibit 3.11-1 presents typical indoor and outdoor noise levels.
As indicated, typical sounds range from 40 dBA (very quiet) to 100 dBA (very loud). Conversation is roughly
60 dBA at a three to five-foot distance between subjects. As background noise levels exceed 60 dBA, speech
intelligibility becomes increasingly difficult. Noise becomes physically discomforting at 110 dBA.
With respect to how humans perceive and react to changes in noise levels, a 1-dBA increase is imperceptible, a
3-dBA increase is barely perceptible, a 6-dBA increase is clearly noticeable, and a 10-dBA increase is
subjectively perceived as approximately twice as loud (Egan 1988), as presented in Table 3.11-9. Table 3.11-9
was developed on the basis of test subjects’ reactions to changes in the levels of steady-state pure tones or
broadband noise and to changes in levels of a given noise source. It is probably most applicable to noise levels in
the range of 50–70 dBA, as this is the usual range of voice and interior noise levels.

Sound Propagation and Attenuation
As sound (noise) propagates from the source to the receptor, the attenuation—the manner of noise reduction in
relation to distance—depends on surface characteristics, atmospheric conditions, and the presence of physical
barriers. The inverse-square law describes the attenuation caused by the pattern in which sound travels from the
source to receptor. Sound travels uniformly outward from a point source in a spherical pattern with an attenuation
rate of 6 dBA per doubling of distance (dBA/DD). However, from a line source (e.g., a road), sound travels
uniformly outward in a cylindrical pattern with an attenuation rate of 3 dBA. The surface characteristics between
the source and the receptor may result in additional sound absorption and/or reflection. Atmospheric conditions
such as wind speed, temperature, and humidity may affect noise levels. Furthermore, the presence of a barrier
between the source and the receptor may also attenuate noise levels. The actual amount of attenuation depends on
the size of the barrier and the frequency of the noise. A noise barrier may be any natural or human-made feature
such as a hill, tree, building, wall, or berm (Caltrans 1998).
All buildings provide some exterior-to-interior noise reduction. A building constructed with a wood frame and a
stucco or wood sheathing exterior typically provides a minimum exterior-to-interior noise reduction of 25 dBA
with its windows closed, whereas a building constructed of a steel or concrete frame, a curtain wall or masonry
exterior wall, and fixed plate-glass windows of one-quarter-inch thickness typically provides an exterior-tointerior noise reduction of 30–40 dBA with its windows closed (Paul S. Veneklasen & Associates 1973, cited in
Caltrans 2002).
Noise Descriptors
The selection of a proper noise descriptor for a specific source depends on the spatial and temporal distribution,
duration, and fluctuation of the noise. The noise descriptors most often encountered when dealing with traffic,
community, and environmental noise are defined below (Caltrans 1998, Lipscomb and Taylor 1978):
►

Lmax (maximum noise level): The maximum instantaneous noise level during a specific period of time. The
Lmax may also be referred to as the “peak (noise) level.”

►

Lmin (minimum noise level): The minimum instantaneous noise level during a specific period of time.

►

LX (statistical descriptor): The noise level exceeded X% of a specific period of time.

►

►

►

►

Leq (equivalent noise level): The energy mean (average) noise level. The instantaneous noise levels during a
specific period of time in dBA are converted to relative energy values. From the sum of the relative energy
values, an average energy value is calculated, which is then converted back to dBA to determine the Leq. In
noise environments determined by major noise events, such as aircraft overflights, the Leq value is heavily
influenced by the magnitude and number of single events that produce the high noise levels.
Ldn (day-night noise level): The 24-hour Leq with a 10-dBA “penalty” for noise events that occur during the
noise-sensitive hours between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. In other words, 10 dBA is “added” to noise events
that occur in the nighttime hours, and this generates a higher reported noise level when determining
compliance with noise standards. The Ldn attempts to account for the fact that noise during this specific period
of time is a potential source of disturbance with respect to normal sleeping hours.
CNEL (community noise equivalent level): Similar to the Ldn described above, but with an additional 5dBA “penalty” added to noise events that occur during the noise-sensitive hours between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00
p.m., which are typically reserved for relaxation, conversation, reading, and television. When the same 24hour noise data are used, the reported CNEL is typically approximately 0.5 dBA higher than the Ldn.
SEL (single-event [impulsive] noise level): A receiver’s cumulative noise exposure from a single impulsive
noise event, which is defined as an acoustical event that is of short duration and involves a change in sound

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Noise

pressure above some reference value. SELs typically represent the noise events used to calculate the Leq, Ldn,
and CNEL.
Community noise is commonly described in terms of the ambient noise level, which is defined as the allencompassing noise level associated with a given noise environment. A common statistical tool to measure the
ambient noise level is the average, or equivalent, sound-level Leq, which corresponds to a steady-state A-weighted
sound level containing the same total energy as a time-varying signal over a given time period (usually 1 hour).
The Leq is the foundation of the composite noise descriptors such as Ldn and CNEL, as defined above, and
correlates well with community response to noise.
Negative Effects of Noise on Humans
Negative effects of noise exposure include physical damage to the human auditory system, interference, and
disease. Exposure to noise may result in physical damage to the auditory system, which may lead to gradual or
traumatic hearing loss. Gradual hearing loss is caused by sustained exposure to moderately high noise levels over
a period of time; traumatic hearing loss is caused by sudden exposure to extremely high noise levels over a short
period. Gradual and traumatic hearing loss both may result in permanent hearing damage. In addition, noise may
interfere with or interrupt sleep, relaxation, recreation, and communication. Although most interference may be
classified as annoying, the inability to hear a warning signal may be considered dangerous. Noise may also be a
contributor to diseases associated with stress, such as hypertension, anxiety, and heart disease. The degree to
which noise contributes to such diseases depends on the frequency, bandwidth, and level of the noise, and the
exposure time (Caltrans 1998: N-2200).
Vibration
Vibration is the periodic oscillation of a medium or object. The rumbling sound caused by the vibration of room
surfaces is called structureborne noise. Sources of groundborne vibrations include natural phenomena (e.g.,
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, sea waves, and landslides) or human-made causes (e.g., explosions, machinery,
traffic, trains, and construction equipment). Vibration sources may be continuous, such as factory machinery, or
transient, such as explosions. As is the case with airborne sound, groundborne vibrations may be described by
amplitude and frequency.
Vibration amplitudes are usually expressed in PPV or RMS, as in RMS vibration velocity; the PPV and RMS
velocity are normally described in in/sec (see the description of federal regulations under “Regulatory Setting”
above). PPV is defined as the maximum instantaneous positive or negative peak of a vibration signal. PPV is
often used in monitoring of blasting vibration because it is related to the stresses that are experienced by buildings
(FTA 2006: 7-3, Caltrans 2002: 6).
Although PPV is appropriate for evaluating the potential for building damage, it is not always suitable for
evaluating human response. It takes some time for the human body to respond to vibration signals. In a sense, the
human body responds to average vibration amplitude. The RMS of a signal is the average of the squared
amplitude of the signal, typically calculated over 1 second. As with airborne sound, the RMS velocity is often
expressed in decibel notation as VdB, which serves to compress the range of numbers required to describe
vibration (FTA 2006: 7-4), and based on a reference value of 1 μin/sec (see the description of federal regulations
under “Regulatory Setting” above).
The background vibration-velocity level in residential areas is usually approximately 50 VdB. Groundborne
vibration is normally perceptible to humans at approximately 65 VdB. For most people, a vibration-velocity level
of 75 VdB is the approximate dividing line between barely perceptible and distinctly perceptible levels (FTA
2006: 7-8).
Typical outdoor sources of perceptible groundborne vibration are construction equipment, steel-wheeled trains,
and traffic on rough roads. If a roadway is smooth, the groundborne vibration is rarely perceptible. The range of

interest is from approximately 50 VdB, the typical background vibration-velocity level, to 100 VdB, the general
threshold where minor damage can occur in fragile buildings. Construction activities can generate groundborne
vibrations, which can pose a risk to nearby structures. Constant or transient vibrations can weaken structures,
crack facades, and disturb occupants (FTA 2006: 7-5).
Construction vibrations can be transient, random, or continuous. Transient construction vibrations are generated
by blasting, impact pile driving, and wrecking balls. Continuous vibrations result from vibratory pile drivers, large
pumps, horizontal directional drilling, and compressors. Random vibration can result from jackhammers,
pavement breakers, and heavy construction equipment. Table 3.11-10 describes the general human response to
different levels of groundborne vibration-velocity levels.

Existing Noise Environment
The study area is located along the south shore of Lake Tahoe, bounded generally by U.S. 50 and the Highland
Woods neighborhood on the south, the Al Tahoe neighborhood on the east, and Tahoe Islands/Sky Meadows and
Tahoe Keys neighborhoods on the west. The study area is approximately 592 acres and includes parcels owned by
the California Tahoe Conservancy and other public and private entities. It includes the downstream reaches of
Trout Creek and the Upper Truckee River, adjacent wetland and upland habitats, and the Lower West Side
Wetlands Restoration Project site (see Exhibit 1-2 in Chapter 1, “Introduction and Statement of Purpose and
Need”).
Existing ambient noise levels across the majority of the site, except for those areas closest to U.S. 50, are
relatively quiet. The predominant noise sources in the study area consist of natural area-source sounds, such as
wind, water moving, and birds. Other noise sources include urban sounds, such as dogs barking, people working
(e.g., hammering or chopping wood) or recreating outdoors, occasional aircraft overflights, use of motorized
watercraft on Lake Tahoe, activity at the Tahoe Keys Marina, and traffic noise associated with vehicles traveling
on U.S. 50 and on local residential streets (e.g., Colorado Avenue/Colorado Court, Tahoe Keys Boulevard, East
Venice Drive, El Dorado Avenue, and Springwood Drive).
Ambient noise levels in the study area are affected primarily by vehicular traffic on nearby roadways. Roadways
in the vicinity of the study area, including U.S. 50, frequently experience moderate to high levels of traffic on a
seasonal basis, particularly in summer and winter when the Tahoe Basin draws the most visitors.
Ambient noise measurements were conducted by EDAW (now AECOM) on October 1, 2007, to document the
existing ambient noise levels at various locations within the study area. Short-term noise-level measurements
were taken in accordance with the American National Standards Institute acoustic standards at four locations
using a Larson Davis Model 820 sound-level meter. The short-term Leq, Lmax, and Lmin values for each ambientnoise-level measurement location are presented in Table 3.11-11.

Based on the measurements conducted, average daytime noise levels (in dBA Leq) at all measurement locations
generally ranged from the mid-40s to low 50s. All locations are in attainment with the most stringent PAS
standards (50 dBA CNEL). Observations made during AECOM’s field visit indicate that natural sources, such as
bird calls or wind rustling trees account for much of the noise recorded by the sound-level meters, and sound
generated by these sources is not typically considered undesirable. It is also important to note that because noise
measurement locations were on the perimeter of the study area and off-site unnatural noise sources (such as
vehicle traffic) were included in the overall measurement, existing sound levels across the interior of the site are
expected to be lower.
As stated above, one of the key noise sources within the study area and the vicinity is vehicle traffic on area
roadways. For the purposes of this analysis, existing traffic noise levels were modeled for affected roadway
segments of U.S. 50 using the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Traffic Noise Prediction Model (see
Table 3.11-12), based on data obtained from the traffic analysis prepared for this project (see Section 3.16,
“Transportation, Parking, and Circulation”). Additional input data included day/night percentages of autos,
medium- and heavy-duty trucks, vehicle speeds, ground attenuation factors, and roadway widths. As discussed
above in “Regulatory Setting,” the average noise level standard for the U.S. 50 corridor is 65 dBA CNEL.

Noise-Sensitive Receptors
Noise sensitive receptors adjacent to the study area include the residential neighborhoods of Highland Woods to
the south, Tahoe Keys and Tahoe Islands/Sky Meadows to the west, and Al Tahoe to the east. The closest
sensitive receptors in these neighborhoods would be those located on East Venice Drive, Springwood Drive,
Michael Drive, Colorado Avenue/Colorado Court, and El Dorado Avenue, all of which are located directly
adjacent to the study area.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES AND MITIGATION MEASURES

SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA
For this analysis, significance criteria are based on the checklist presented in Appendix G of the State CEQA
Guidelines; the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist; and regulatory standards of federal, state, and local
agencies, specifically standards established by El Dorado County. Federal law defers to state and local regulations
for the purposes of assessing noise impacts, and TRPA has not set any criteria for vibration, so the state standards
are applied. These criteria also encompass the factors taken into account under NEPA to determine the
significance of an action in terms of the context and intensity of its effects.
CEQA Criteria
A noise impact is considered significant if implementation of the proposed project would result in any of the
following:
►

►

►

►

►

short-term construction-generated noise levels that exceed the relevant El Dorado County standards or a
substantial increase (greater than 3 dBA) in ambient noise at nearby existing noise-sensitive receptors during
the more sensitive early morning, evening, and nighttime hours of the day (i.e., outside the hours considered
exempt by the Noise Element of the El Dorado County General Plan—7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., Monday
through Friday, and 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on weekends, and on federally recognized holidays) (CEQA 1);
long-term (operational) stationary- or area-source noise levels that exceed applicable noise standards or a
substantial increase (greater than 3 dBA) in ambient noise at nearby existing noise-sensitive receptors
(CEQA 2);
short- or long-term (operational) traffic-generated noise levels that exceed the relevant El Dorado County
noise standards for transportation noise sources or a substantial increase (greater than 3 dBA) in ambient
noise levels at nearby existing noise-sensitive receptors (CEQA 3);
increases in existing CNELs beyond those permitted in the applicable PAS, community plan, or master plan
(CEQA 4); or
exposure of persons to or generation of excessive groundborne vibration or noise levels that exceed Caltrans’s
recommended standard with respect to the prevention of structural building damage (0.2 in/sec PPV and 0.08
in/sec PPV, respectively, for normal and historical buildings) or FTA’s maximum-acceptable vibration
standard with respect to human response (80 VdB for residential structures) at nearby existing or proposed
vibration-sensitive land uses (e.g., residences) (CEQA 5).

NEPA Criteria
An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the
environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the proposed action. Under NEPA, the significance
of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account
under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are
encompassed by the CEQA criteria used for this analysis.
TRPA Criteria
Based on TRPA’s Initial Environmental Checklist, an alternative would result in a significant impact on noise if it
would result in any of the following:
►

increases in existing CNELs beyond those permitted in the applicable PAS, community plan, or master plan
(TRPA 1);

►

the exposure of people to severe noise levels (TRPA 2); or

►

single-event noise levels greater than those set forth in the TRPA Noise Environmental Threshold (TRPA 3).

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
To assess potential noise impacts from construction, stationary sources, and area sources, noise-sensitive
receptors and their relative exposure levels were identified. Noise (and vibration) levels of specific equipment
anticipated to be used in project construction or operation were determined and resultant noise levels at sensitive
receptors were modeled assuming documented noise (vibration) attenuation rates.
The FHWA Traffic Noise Prediction Model was used to model traffic noise levels along affected roadways, based
on daily volumes and the distribution thereof from the traffic analysis prepared for this project (which is described
in Section 3.16, “Transportation, Parking, and Circulation”). The project’s contribution to the existing trafficsource noise levels along area roadways was determined by comparing the modeled noise levels at 50 feet from
the roadway edge under no-project and plus-project conditions. The project’s land use compatibility with future
(2030) traffic source noise levels was determined by comparing modeled noise levels at proposed noise-sensitive
receptors under plus-project conditions.
The significance criteria applied in this analysis address the exterior noise standards established by El Dorado
County. Unless otherwise stated, standards for interior noise levels would not be exceeded if exterior noise-level
standards are achieved because buildings would commonly provide sufficient exterior-to-interior noise reduction.

EFFECTS NOT DISCUSSED FURTHER IN THIS EIR/EIS/EIS
Exceedance of Single-Event Noise Level Thresholds (TRPA 3)—No alternative would result in increasing or
creating single-event noise level sources (aircraft, watercraft, motor vehicles, motorcycles, off-road vehicles, and
over-snow vehicles) regulated by TRPA. Haul trucks related to construction under all action alternatives would
not exceed single-event noise standards; and they would operate only during exempted hours and therefore would
not violate single-event noise standards when applicable. None of the alternatives would create significant singleevent noise impacts.

Alternative 1: Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
IMPACT
3.11-1
(Alt. 1)

Short-Term Project Construction Noise Levels Exceeding Applicable Thresholds. (CEQA 1, TRPA 2)
Short-term construction activities could exceed applicable noise thresholds if they would occur outside hours
exempted by TRPA and El Dorado County. However, noise-generating construction activities related to
implementation of Alternative 1 would be limited to the hours during which construction noise is exempt from
the provisions of the applicable standards. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

The construction activities required for Alternative 1 would include excavating, grading, removing vegetation,
clearing, cut-and-fill earthmoving, trenching, erecting frames, installing equipment, cleaning up the construction
site, transporting materials, winterizing the site, paving, and installing bicycle trails, pedestrian paths, and signage.
The closest existing noise-sensitive receptors (residences along El Dorado Avenue) are a minimum of 100 feet
from the nearest proposed construction activities along the boundary of the study area.
The specific construction equipment required for the above-mentioned activities is not available at this time, but
would likely include the equipment outlined in Table 3.11-13. According to FTA and FHWA, and as shown in
Table 3.11-13, maximum noise levels for these types of equipment can range from 74 to 101 dBA Lmax at 50 feet
when used without feasible noise control. These noise levels and equipment would equate to a maximum
combined noise level of 95.4 dBA Leq at 50 feet (FHWA 2006: 12–6, 7). Based on 95.4 dBA Leq, a typical noiseattenuation rate of 6 dBA/DD, and no intervening shielding or topographic interference, exterior noise levels at
noise-sensitive receptors located within 4,500 feet could exceed the local PAS standard, 55 dBA.

In addition, project construction under Alternative 1 would result in a short-term increase in traffic on the local
area’s roadway network, but this increase would not be sufficient to substantially increase traffic noise levels. It is
expected that up to 176 daily trips (consisting of four haul-truck trips, 152 employee commute trips, and 20
miscellaneous trips) would occur during the periods of maximum construction activity. (This would be more trips
than under Alternative 3 [up to 158 daily trips, respectively] and fewer than under Alternatives 2 and 4 [up to 192
and 306 daily trips, respectively].) Construction-related traffic would be distributed over the roadway network
identified in Section 3.16, “Transportation, Parking, and Circulation” (e.g., San Francisco Avenue, Lakeview
Avenue, East Venice Drive, Silver Dollar Avenue, and Sunset Drive). The daily haul-truck trips would traverse
the haul routes designated in Section 3.16. Typically, traffic must double to create a perceptible increase in overall
traffic noise (Caltrans 1998:N-96). Because all affected roadways (except Sunset Drive, as described below) have
a peak-month minimum of 1,000 average daily trips (ADT), an increase of 176 trips would not double the current
traffic level. Therefore, the additional construction-related traffic would not increase overall traffic noise levels.
Sunset Drive has an existing peak-month ADT of 85 trips. During the phase of construction when Sunset Drive
would be in use, ten construction-related trips per day would occur on that street (see Section 3.16). This is less
than the doubling of trips required to create an increase in traffic noise levels (Caltrans 1998:N-96). Thus, the
additional construction-related traffic on Sunset Drive would not increase overall traffic noise levels.
Noise from construction activity that occurs between 8:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. each day is exempt from the
provisions of the applicable TRPA regulations. Noise from construction activity that occurs between 7:00 a.m.
and 7:00 p.m. on weekdays (or between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on weekends and federal holidays) is exempt
from the provisions of the applicable El Dorado County regulations. In addition, construction activities would be
temporary, and as described in Chapter 2, “Project Alternatives,” noise-generating construction activities would
not occur during the more noise-sensitive hours (i.e., before 8:00 a.m. and after 6:30 p.m. on weekdays, or after
5:00 p.m. on weekends or holidays). Additionally, project-generated construction traffic would not create a
substantial increase in local traffic-noise levels. (There would not be a perceptible increase in overall traffic noise,
and noise from single events [e.g., a truck driving along a haul route] would not exceed TRPA noise standards for
single events [Table 3.11-2].) Because noise from project construction sources would be exempt, would not
exceed the applicable standards, and would not increase overall local traffic-noise levels, this direct impact would
be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.11-2
(Alt. 1)

Long-Term, Project-Related Generation of Stationary- and Area-Source Noise. (CEQA 2, TRPA 2)
Alternative 1 does not include any new long-term stationary or area noise sources. The additional recreation
facilities would not create perceptible increases in vehicle or recreation-activity noise above existing levels in
the study area. This impact would be less than significant.

In addition to restoration features, Alternative 1 includes construction of self-service kiosks, bicycle paths,
pedestrian trails, a pedestrian bridge and boardwalks around the perimeter of the study area. Current noise sources
within and in the vicinity of the study area are the Tahoe Keys Marina and Maintenance Facility, Fresh Ketch
Restaurant, the channel from Tahoe Keys to Lake Tahoe, the existing user-created trail network, a boat launch
with parking lot, and adjacent residential properties. Alternative 1 would provide for a potential “maximum” level
of public access and recreation infrastructure that would include two kiosks, a 27-space parking lot, three
observation areas, boardwalks and pedestrian trails, bicycle paths, and path bridges.
Noise levels in the study area are within the 50-dBA CNEL standard of PAS 100 (which contains most of the
study area), and are within the 55-dBA CNEL standards of the surrounding PAS areas. (See Table 3.11-11.)
Typically, the activity level would need to double before a noticeable increase in noise would occur (Caltrans
1998:N-96). As discussed in Section 3.16, “Transportation, Parking, and Circulation,” the volume of visitors
recreating in the study area could be doubled as a result of the added recreation features of Alternative 1.
However, activities in the adjacent commercial and residential land uses are major components of existing noise
and would not be considerably increased by Alternative 1. Because biking, walking, fishing, and use of kiosks
normally generate lower noise levels than adjacent land uses (e.g., maintenance yards and boating activities, and

use of landscape maintenance equipment), the change in noise levels from adding more recreational activity to the
current ambient noise environment would, therefore, be imperceptible and would not cause PAS standards to be
exceeded both in the study area and at the surrounding land uses.
In summary, no change in the ambient noise environment would occur, nor would applicable thresholds for the
surrounding noise-sensitive receptors and study area be exceeded. Therefore, this impact would be less than
significant.
IMPACT
3.11-3
(Alt. 1)

Long-Term Generation of Project-Related Traffic Noise. (CEQA 3) Long-term project-generated traffic
would not result in a perceptible increase in ambient noise levels on nearby local roadways or highways. This
impact would be less than significant.

Operation of Alternative 1 is expected to result in fewer than 100 vehicle trips per day (see Section 3.16,
“Transportation, Parking, and Circulation”). These trips would be distributed over the local street network
identified in Section 3.16.
The FHWA model was used to calculate traffic-source noise levels along the affected local street network for
existing (baseline) traffic conditions with and without implementation of Alternative 1, based on the predicted
ADT volumes and their distribution over the roadway network. (See Section 3.16 for a detailed discussion of
traffic projections.) Other modeling parameters include fleet mixes (i.e., percentages of automobiles, mediumduty trucks, and heavy-duty trucks during daytime, evening, and nighttime hours), vehicle speeds, ground
attenuation factors, roadway grades, and roadway widths. The alternative’s contribution to the existing traffic
noise levels along area roadways was determined by comparing predicted existing roadside noise levels with and
without traffic associated with project operation under Alternative 1.
Table 3.11-14 summarizes the net change in ADT volumes and in modeled traffic noise levels from existing noproject to plus-project conditions. A map of the local roads and highway segments is shown in Section 3.16.
According to the traffic analysis prepared for this project, implementation of Alternative 1 would result in an
increase of fewer than 100 trips in the total ADT volumes on the affected roadway segments. Such traffic
increases would result in noise-level increases of less than 0.1 dBA CNEL along East Venice Drive, Lakeview
Drive, and San Francisco Avenue; 0.2 dBA CNEL along Sunset Drive; and 0.1 dBA CNEL along Silver Dollar
Avenue (refer to Table 3.11-14), which would be imperceptible to the human ear.

Thus, traffic associated with the long-term operation of Alternative 1 would not result in a perceptible (3-dBA or
greater) increase in daily noise levels along affected local roadways or highways. Therefore, this impact would be
less than significant.
IMPACT
3.11-4
(Alt. 1)

Land Use Compatibility of Study Area Noise Levels and Surrounding Land Uses. (CEQA 4, TRPA 1)
Noise generated by surrounding land uses would not cause noise levels within the study area to exceed
applicable standards, and Alternative 1 would not create any new noise sources that would increase noise
levels above applicable standards at surrounding land uses. Therefore, both Alternative 1 and surrounding
land uses would be compatible. This impact would be less than significant.

After project completion the study area would return to use as a managed natural area and recreation area, similar
to its existing condition. No sensitive receptors are located within the study area, and no major sound sources
would be created by the project under Alternative 1. Noise levels in the study area and surrounding
neighborhoods would be influenced by activities at surrounding land uses and traffic noise on nearby roadways
(e.g., U.S. 50, Venice Boulevard, El Dorado Avenue, Springwood Drive), at Tahoe Keys Marina, at Fresh Ketch
Restaurant, and from boating activities. However, based on noise measurements taken on-site, noise levels are in
compliance with the applicable standards, 55 dBA CNEL for residential neighborhoods surrounding the study
area and 50 dBA CNEL within the study area (see Table 3.11-11). Additionally, no substantial increase in traffic
is expected to occur. Therefore, traffic noise levels would remain similar to current levels.
After completion of construction, noise levels would return to their preproject levels. Because no exceedance or
increase in noise would occur within the study area or at nearby sensitive receptors as a result of Alternative 1,
this direct impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT

Short- and Long-Term Increases in Groundborne Vibration Levels. (CEQA 5) Project-generated
groundborne vibration would not disrupt humans’ activities, including sleep, or damage structures. This impact
would be less than significant.

Long-term project operation under Alternative 1 would not include any major sources of vibration. However,
construction activities could result in varying degrees of temporary groundborne vibration, depending on the
specific construction equipment used and operations involved. Vibration generated by construction equipment
spreads through the ground and diminishes in magnitude with increases in distance. Table 3.11-15 displays
vibration levels for typical construction equipment.

According to FTA, vibration levels associated with the use of such equipment would be approximately 87 VdB
(referenced to 1 μin/sec and based on the RMS velocity amplitude) at 25 feet, as shown in Table 3.11-15. Using
FTA’s recommended procedure (see subsection “Vibration” above, FTA 2006: 12-11 to 12-13) for applying a
propagation adjustment to these reference levels, predicted worst-case vibration levels would exceed 80 VdB
(FTA’s maximum-acceptable vibration standard with respect to human annoyance for residential uses) within 60
feet of vibration-sensitive receptors. The closest existing vibration-sensitive receptors (residences along El
Dorado Avenue) are a minimum of 100 feet from the nearest proposed construction activities along the boundary
of the study area.
As stated in Impact 3.11-1 (Alt. 1), noise-generating construction activities would not occur during the more
noise-sensitive hours (i.e., before 8:00 a.m. and after 6:30 p.m. weekdays, or after 5:00 p.m. on weekends and
holidays). Thus, vibration from construction sources would not disrupt the sleep of occupants of vibrationsensitive land uses.
Excessive vibration levels associated with project construction would be limited to the daytime hours of 8:00 a.m.
to 6:30 p.m. on weekdays and 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on weekends/holidays, as required by TRPA and El Dorado
County regulations. Additionally, no existing sensitive receptors are within 60 feet of the affected study area. This
direct impact would be less than significant.

(Alt. 2)

Short-Term Project Construction Noise Levels Exceeding Applicable Thresholds. (CEQA 1, TRPA 2)
Short-term construction activities could exceed applicable noise thresholds if they would occur outside hours
exempted by TRPA and El Dorado County. However, noise-generating construction activities related to
implementation of Alternative 2 would be limited to the hours during which construction noise is exempt from
the provisions of the applicable standards. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

Construction activities under Alternative 2 would be similar to those under Alternative 1, but would not include
any new structures.
The construction equipment required in Alternative 2 would likely include loaders, dozers/tractors, cranes,
scrapers, excavators, backhoes, graders, generators, and trucks. According to EPA and FHWA, maximum noise
levels for these types of equipment can range from 78 to 85 dBA at 50 feet when used without feasible noise
control (Table 3.11-13). Based on these noise levels and a typical noise-attenuation rate of 6 dBA/DD, exterior
noise levels at noise-sensitive receptors located within 2,500 feet could exceed the local PAS standard, 55 dBA
CNEL.
In addition, project construction under Alternative 2 would result in a short-term increase in traffic on the local
area’s roadway network. It is expected that up to 192 daily trips (consisting of 10 haul-truck trips, 154 employee
commute trips, and 28 miscellaneous trips) would occur during the periods of maximum construction activity.
(This would be more trips than under Alternatives 1 and 3 [up to 176 and 158 daily trips, respectively] and fewer
than under Alternative 4 [up to 306 daily trips].) As under Alternative 1, construction-related traffic would be
distributed over the roadway network identified in Section 3.16, “Transportation, Parking, and Circulation” (e.g.,
San Francisco Avenue, Lakeview Avenue, East Venice Drive, Silver Dollar Avenue, and Sunset Drive). The daily
haul-truck trips would traverse haul routes designated in Section 3.16. Typically, traffic must double to create an
increase in perceptible traffic noise (Caltrans 1998: N-96). Because all affected roadways (except Sunset Drive)
have a peak-month minimum of 1,000 ADT, an increase of 192 trips would not double the current traffic level.
Therefore, the additional construction-related traffic would not increase traffic noise levels. In addition, for the
same reasons as described under Impact 3.11-1 (Alt. 1), the additional construction-related traffic on Sunset Drive
would not increase traffic noise levels.

Noise from construction activity that occurs between 8:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. each day is exempt from the
provisions of the applicable TRPA regulations. Noise from construction activity that occurs between 7:00 a.m.
and 7:00 p.m. on weekdays (or between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on weekends and federal holidays) is exempt
from the provisions of the applicable El Dorado County regulations. In addition, construction activities would be
temporary, and as described in Chapter 2, “Project Alternatives,” noise-generating construction activities would
not occur during the more noise-sensitive hours (i.e., before 8:00 a.m. and after 6:30 p.m. on weekdays, or after
5:00 p.m. on weekends or holidays). Additionally, project-generated construction traffic would not create an
increase in local traffic-noise levels. (There would not be a perceptible increase in overall traffic noise, and noise
from single events [e.g., a truck driving along a haul route] would not exceed TRPA noise standards for single
events [Table 3.11-2].) Because noise from project construction sources would be exempt, would not exceed the
applicable standards, and would not increase local traffic-noise levels, this direct impact would be less than
significant.

(Alt. 2)

Long-Term Project-Related Generation of Stationary- and Area-Source Noise. (CEQA 2, TRPA 2)
Alternative 2 does not include any new long-term stationary or area noise sources. The additional recreation
facilities would not create perceptible increases in vehicle noise or pedestrian activity above existing levels in
the study area. This impact would be less than significant.

Alternative 2 would include restoration elements described in Chapter 2, “Project Alternatives.” Unlike under
Alternative 1, no new buildings would be constructed. Limited trail upgrades would occur along with installation
of new signage and an interpretive program.
Alternative 2 would provide a “minimum” level of infrastructure that would include signage, a pedestrian trail to
Cove East Beach (which would replace the existing pedestrian trail), five viewpoints, and a fishing platform.
Because Alternative 2 is a minimum infrastructure alternative, fewer new users would be generated by Alternative
2 than by the maximum recreation alternative, Alternative 1. Because existing recreation numbers are
approximately 20 visitors per hour and both current and potential new users would be dispersed throughout the
study area, and because Alternative 2 would generate only a slight increase in use of the study area, the additional
new users accessing the study area from multiple entry points would not generate a substantial increase in area
noise levels or cause PAS standards to be exceeded in the study area or at the surrounding land uses.
Alternative 2 would not create or increase area-source noise. Thus, no change in the ambient noise environment
would occur, nor would applicable thresholds for the surrounding noise-sensitive receptors and study area be
exceeded. Therefore, this indirect impact would be less than significant.

Long-Term Generation of Project-Related Traffic Noise. (CEQA 3) Long-term project-generated traffic

Impact 3.11-3 (Alt. 2) would be similar to Impact 3.11-3 (Alt. 1). Alternative 2 would add fewer than 100 trips
per day to the existing roadway network (see Table 3.11-14). Refer to Impact 3.11-3 (Alt. 1) and Table 3.11-14

Short-Term Project Construction Noise Levels Exceeding Applicable Thresholds. (CEQA 1, TRPA 2)
Short-term construction activities could exceed applicable noise thresholds if they would occur outside hours
exempted by TRPA and El Dorado County. However, noise-generating construction activities related to
implementation of Alternative 1 would be limited to the hours during which construction noise is exempt from
the provisions of the applicable standards. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

Construction activities under Alternative 3 would be similar to those under Alternative 1.
The construction equipment required in Alternative 3 would likely include a loader, dozer/tractor, crane, scraper,
excavator, backhoe, grader, generator, and trucks. According to EPA and FHWA, maximum noise levels for these
types of equipment can range from 78 to 85 dBA at 50 feet when used without feasible noise control (Table
3.11-13). Based on these noise levels and a typical noise-attenuation rate of 6 dBA/DD, exterior noise levels at
noise-sensitive receptors located within 2,500 feet could exceed local PAS standards (50 or 55 dBA CNEL).
In addition, project construction under Alternative 3 would result in a short-term increase in traffic on the local
area’s roadway network. It is expected that up to 158 daily trips (consisting of four haul-truck trips, 136 employee
commute trips, and 14 miscellaneous trips) would occur during the periods of maximum construction activity.
(This would be fewer trips than under Alternatives 1, 2, and 4 [up to 176, 192, and 306 daily trips, respectively].)
Construction-related traffic would be distributed over the roadway network identified in Section 3.16 (e.g., San
Francisco Avenue, Lakeview Avenue, East Venice Drive, Silver Dollar Avenue, and Sunset Drive). The daily
truck haul trips would occur through haul routes designated in Section 3.16. Typically, it requires a doubling of
traffic to create an increase in perceptible traffic noise (Caltrans 1998: N-96). Because all affected roadways
(except Sunset Drive) have a peak-month minimum of 1,000 ADT, an increase of 158 trips would not double the
current traffic level. Therefore, the additional construction-related traffic would not increase the traffic noise
levels. In addition, for the same reasons as described under Impact 3.11-1 (Alt. 1), the additional constructionrelated traffic on Sunset Drive would not increase traffic noise levels.
Noise from construction activity that occurs between 8:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. each day is exempt from the
provisions of the applicable TRPA regulations. Noise from construction activity that occurs between 7:00 a.m. and
7:00p.m. on weekdays (or between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on weekends and federal holidays) is exempt from the

Alternative 3 includes restoration elements described in Chapter 2, “Project Alternatives,” and a new self-service

pedestrian trails, and new signage and an interpretative program added.
Alternative 3 would provide a “moderate” level of infrastructure that would include three pedestrian trails (two
segments of which would be boardwalks), a kiosk, one observation area, six viewpoints, a fishing platform, and
signage at multiple locations. Because Alternative 3 is a moderate infrastructure alternative, fewer new users
would be generated by Alternative 3 than by the maximum recreation alternative, Alternative 1, but more than the
minimum recreation alternative, Alternative 2. Because existing recreation numbers are approximately 20 visitors

Based on these noise levels and a typical noise-attenuation rate of 6 dBA/DD, exterior noise levels at noisesensitive receptors located within 2,500 feet could exceed local PAS standards (50 or 55 dBA CNEL).
In addition, project construction under Alternative 4 would result in a short-term increase in traffic on the local

Animal Control
According to Section 6-22 of the CSLT Municipal Code:
It shall be unlawful for any person owning or having charge of any stray dog, as defined herein,
to cause, permit or allow such dogs, whether licensed or unlicensed, to stray, wander or otherwise
be at loose or at large upon any public street, alley, park, beach, way or other public property
within the city, or upon any private property within the city other than private property of which
the owner of the dog has ownership or control, unless such dog is kept securely confined by a
leash, rope, cord or chain not over 10 feet in length held by some person or securely attached to
some stationary object. Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to prevent a dog from
being used without a leash to herd, guard or gather domestic animals or fowls in the normal and
customary manner of “working dogs.” Nor shall this section be deemed to prohibit participation
in obedience trials or dog shows without a leash so long as the dog is under the charge and
control of a person competent to control such dog and the dog does not harm or damage, or
threaten to harm or damage, any person or public or private property. (Ordinance. 515 § 7;
Ordinance 548 § 2)

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Law Enforcement
South Lake Tahoe Police Department
Police service in the study area is provided by the South Lake Tahoe Police Department (SLTPD). SLTPD is
located within the government complex at the intersection of Al Tahoe and Johnson Boulevards. This complex
also houses the El Dorado County Superior Court, Sheriff-Coroner, and Sheriff’s Department, among others.
SLTPD is allocated 41 sworn officers for an estimated 1.7 officers per 1,000 residents (based on the current
population of approximately 24,000 residents). These staffing numbers may vary slightly, based on availability of
grant-funded positions and increases from seasonal work force employment. The population of South Lake Tahoe
can reach 75,000 during the summer months. Because of this fluctuation, SLTPD does not use staffing ratios to
determine human resource needs. SLTPD’s response-time goal is to arrive in less than 3 minutes for priority one
calls (rape, robbery, or crimes in progress), none of which has generally been an issue in the study area. Only
priority one calls are tracked; thus, response-time goals are not set for other calls (Daniels, pers. comm., 2007).
SLTPD has informal mutual aid agreements with the El Dorado County Sheriff’s Department and the Douglas
County Sheriff’s Department for response during critical incidents. While the study area is state land, it is within a
local response area, not a state response area (PRC Section 4125-4128).

El Dorado County Sheriff’s Department
The Conservancy contracts with the El Dorado County Sheriff’s Department to provide patrols of the project
area. Although the study area is not the primary jurisdiction of the Sheriff’s Department, the Conservancy utilizes
its services to supplement management of the property.
Fire Protection and Emergency Services
The study area is serviced by the South Lake Tahoe Fire Department (SLTFD). SLTFD serves a land area of 18
square miles along Lake Tahoe’s South Shore, and the study area is in the northwestern portion. The department
responds to events including structural fires, vegetation fires, hazardous materials spills, water and ice rescue
incidents, emergency medical incidents, and aircraft incidents. SLTFD maintains a minimum daily staff of 11 and
currently employs 41 fire suppression personnel. The ratio of on-duty firefighters per 1,000 residents is 1.7
personnel per 1,000 residents (based on the current estimated population of 24,000 residents). The ratio of total
force to population is 2.2 personnel per 1,000 residents (Gigliotti, pers. comm., 2007).
SLTFD manages three fire stations, all within the city limits:
►

►

►

Fire Station #1, located at 1252 Ski Run Boulevard, includes Engine 1 (staffed by one captain and one
engineer) and Medic 1 (staffed by one firefighter paramedic and one firefighter);
Fire Station #2, located at 2951 Lake Tahoe Boulevard, includes Engine 2 (staffed by one captain and one
engineer), and Truck 2 (can be staffed by the Engine 2 crew for extrication or commercial fires); and
Fire Station #3, located at 2101 Lake Tahoe Boulevard, includes Engine 3 (staffed by one captain and one
engineer), Medic 3 (staffed by one firefighter paramedic and one firefighter), and SLTFD administrative
offices.

Fire Station 3 provides first response to the study area. This station is located near the junction of U.S. Highway
50 (U.S. 50) and U.S. 89, approximately 0.75 mile from the southwest corner of the study area (near the junction
of Tahoe Keys Boulevard and Sky Meadows Court). The average response time by the entire department
(including all three fire stations) is approximately 3.5 minutes. The average response time by Fire Station 3 for
any service call is approximately 5 minutes (Gigliotti, pers. comm., 2007).
Animal Control
The South Lake Tahoe operations of El Dorado County Animal Control (EDCAC) provide services in the Tahoe
Basin portion of El Dorado County, from Tahoma on the West Shore to Stateline on the South Shore and west
along U.S. 50 to the community of Kyburz, California. EDCAC also provides limited animal control services to
Alpine County. The animal shelter (located at 1120 Shakori Drive in South Lake Tahoe [Meyers], just off SR 89)
has six staff members: one supervising animal control officer, one senior animal control officer, two animal
control officers, one public services assistant, and one kennel attendant. Response time varies, depending on
officer location in the field and prioritization of pending calls. Typical response time is 5–15 minutes (Gerat, pers.
comm., 2007).
Officers also respond to requests for service to investigate complaints about barking dogs, dogs running loose,
animal neglect or cruelty, and potentially dangerous or vicious animals. Such service is provided Monday–
Saturday, from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. In addition, EDCAC provides 24-hour emergency response to reports of
injured animals, animal bites, and impounds pursuant to an arrest of the animal’s owner. The animal shelter,
houses stray animals and provides adoption services. Even though EDCAC is an El Dorado County agency, it
enforces CSLT ordinances.

SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA
For this analysis, significance criteria are based on the checklist presented in Appendix G of the State CEQA
Guidelines; the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist; factual or scientific information and data; and regulatory
standards of federal, state, and local agencies. These criteria also encompass the factors taken into account under
NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and intensity of its effects.
CEQA Criteria
Under CEQA, an alternative was determined to result in a significant effect related to public services if it would:
►

►

►

create a need for the development of new service facilities (e.g., fire, police, schools), the construction of
which could result in significant environmental impacts (CEQA 1);
create circumstances where existing services and facilities could not meet established performance standards
(CEQA 2); or
substantially impede existing services (CEQA 3).

NEPA Criteria
An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the
environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the proposed action. Under NEPA, the significance
of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account
under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are
encompassed by the CEQA criteria used for this analysis.
TRPA Criteria
TRPA’s Initial Environmental Checklist indicates that a public services impact would be considered significant if
it had an unplanned effect on, or resulted in a need for, new or altered governmental services—specifically:
►
►
►
►
►

fire protection (TRPA 1);
police protection (TRPA 2);
schools (TRPA 3);
parks or other recreation facilities (TRPA 4); or
maintenance of public facilities, including roads (TRPA 5).

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
Impacts on public services that could result from the proposed alternatives were identified by considering whether
and how existing services or future demand for services would be affected by project implementation. Evaluation
of potential public service impacts was based on a review of documents pertaining to the study area, including the
TRPA Regional Plan, the TRPA Code of Ordinances, the TRPA Community Wildfire Protection Plan for the
California Portion of the Lake Tahoe Basin (TRPA 2004b), the TRPA Fuel Reduction and Forest Restoration
Plan for the Lake Tahoe Basin Wildland Urban Interface (TRPA 2007), the City of South Lake Tahoe General
Plan (CSLT 1999), and the CSLT Municipal Code. Additional background information on current services,
staffing, and equipment for law enforcement, fire and emergency services, and animal control was obtained
through consultation with the SLTPD, SLTFD, and EDCAC, as well as with the HSP private security company.
Population growth in the Tahoe Basin is anticipated to cause a proportionate increase in demand for public
services and in use of the study area.

EFFECTS NOT DISCUSSED FURTHER IN THIS EIR/EIS/EIS
Increased Demand on Schools (CEQA 1, 2, 3 in part; TRPA 3)—No impacts on school demands are
anticipated to result from any of the project alternatives. There are no schools within the study area, and none of
the alternatives would contribute to population growth or the number of students in the community.

IMPACT ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
Alternative 1: Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
IMPACT
3.12-1
(Alt. 1)

Potential for Longer Emergency-Vehicle Response Times Caused by Roadway Obstruction during
Construction. (CEQA 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2) Implementation of Alternative 1 could obstruct roadways in the project
vicinity, and thus could slow or stop emergency vehicles. However, as described in Environmental
Commitment 12, the Conservancy, the project contractor(s), or both would prepare and implement traffic
control plans for construction activities that may affect a road right-of-way. Therefore, this impact would be less
than significant.

Alternative 1 would include various construction activities over approximately four years. Although a majority of
project construction activities would occur on site, nearby roadways including East Venice Drive, Washington
Avenue, Tahoe Keys Boulevard, and U.S. 50 would be affected (see Section 3.16, “Transportation, Parking, and
Circulation”). Ongoing construction activities could result in temporary lane closures, increased truck traffic, and
other roadway effects that could slow or temporarily stop emergency vehicles, temporarily increasing response
times and impeding existing service. However, as described in Environmental Commitment 12, “Prepare and
Implement Traffic Control Plans” (Table 2-6), the Conservancy, the project contractor(s), or both would prepare
and implement traffic control plans for construction activities that may affect road right-of-way. The traffic
control plans would follow standards of the agency responsible for the affected roadway and would be signed by a
professional engineer. Measures typically used in traffic control plans include advertising of planned lane
closures, warning signage, a flag person to direct traffic flows when needed, and methods to ensure continued
access by emergency vehicles. These measures would substantially reduce any potential effects on response times
and existing service. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.12-2
(Alt. 1)

Potential Need for Additional Public Services or Facilities as a Result of Increased Demand for Public
Services. (CEQA 1–3; TRPA 1, 2, 4, 5) Alternative 1 would create additional recreation facilities and could
attract additional visitors to the study area. Therefore, it could increase the demand for fire protection, police,
and animal control services. However, Alternative 1 is not expected to attract enough visitors to require a
substantial increase in fire protection, police protection, or animal control services or facilities. Therefore, this
impact would be less than significant.

Features of Alternative 1 that might attract additional visitors would include kiosks, interconnected bicycle paths,
pedestrian trails, boardwalks, a bridge over the Upper Truckee River, and observation platforms and viewpoints.
(The proposed bridge and boardwalk over the Upper Truckee River would be a new public-access element in the
study area.)
The proposed public access and recreational facilities would be similar and related to existing uses. The study area
already includes user-created trails and attracts visitors to the site and the beach. Some of these features would
reduce the effects of existing uses on natural resources by directing use to less environmentally sensitive
locations, rather than support substantial additional use. Therefore, an increase in the number of visitors would not
be substantial; the resulting increase in demand for public services would also not be substantial, and would not
create the need for additional services or new facilities.

SLTFD foresees no added fire protection concerns with Alternative 1, including fire protection service to the
proposed visitor centers (Zachau, pers. comm., 2007).
Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.
Alternative 2: New Channel—West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure)
IMPACT
3.12-1
(Alt. 2)

Potential for Longer Emergency-Vehicle Response Times Caused by Roadway Obstruction during
Construction. (CEQA 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2) Implementation of Alternative 2 could obstruct roadways in the project
vicinity, and thus could slow or stop emergency vehicles. However, as described in Environmental
Commitment 12, the Conservancy, the project contractor(s), or both would prepare and implement traffic
control plans for construction activities that may affect road right-of-way. Therefore, this impact would be less
than significant.

Impact 3.12-1 (Alt. 2) would be similar to Impact 3.12-1 (Alt. 1). Although slightly smaller in scale than
Alternative 1, construction of Alternative 2 would have similar effects on roadways, and thus could slow or stop
emergency vehicles. For the same reasons as described above, this impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.12-2
(Alt. 2)

Potential Need for Additional Public Services or Facilities as a Result of Increased Demand for Public
Services. (CEQA 1–3; TRPA 1, 2, 4, 5) Alternative 2 would create additional recreation facilities and could
attract additional visitors to the study area. Therefore, it could increase the demand for fire protection, police,
and animal control services. However, Alternative 2 is not expected to attract enough visitors to require a
significant increase in fire protection, police protection, or animal control services or facilities. Therefore, this
impact would be less than significant.

This impact would be similar to Impact 3.12-2 (Alt. 1), but smaller in magnitude because Alternative 2 would add
fewer recreation facilities to the study area. For the same reasons as described for Alternative 1 above, this impact
would be less than significant.
Alternative 3: Middle Marsh Corridor (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
IMPACT
3.12-1
(Alt. 3)

Potential for Longer Emergency-Vehicle Response Times Caused by Roadway Obstruction during
Construction. (CEQA 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2) Implementation of Alternative 3 could obstruct roadways in the project
vicinity, and thus could slow or stop emergency vehicles. However, as described in Environmental
Commitment 12, the Conservancy, the project contractor(s), or both would prepare and implement traffic
control plans for construction activities that may affect road right-of-way. Therefore, this impact would be less
than significant.

Impact 3.12-1 (Alt. 3) would be similar to Impact 3.12-1 (Alt. 1). Although slightly smaller in scale than
Alternative 1, construction of Alternative 3 would have similar effects on roadways, and thus could slow or stop

(Alt. 3)

Potential Need for Additional Public Services or Facilities as a Result of Increased Demand for Public
Services. (CEQA 1–3; TRPA 1, 2, 4, 5) Alternative 2 would create additional recreation facilities and could attract
additional visitors to the study area. Therefore, it could increase the demand for fire protection, police, and animal
control services. However, Alternative 3 is not expected to attract enough visitors to require a significant increase
in fire protection, police protection, or animal control services or facilities. Therefore, this impact would be less

Alternative 4: Inset Floodplain (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
IMPACT
3.12-1
(Alt. 4)

Potential for Longer Emergency-Vehicle Response Times Caused by Roadway Obstruction during
Construction. (CEQA 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2) Implementation of Alternative 4 could obstruct roadways in the project
vicinity, and thus could slow or stop emergency vehicles. However, as described in Environmental

IMPACT
3.12-2
(Alt. 4)

Potential Need for Additional Public Services or Facilities as a Result of Increased Demand for Public
Services. (CEQA 1–3; TRPA 1, 2, 4, 5) Alternative 4 would create additional recreation facilities and could
attract additional visitors to the study area. Therefore, it could increase the demand for fire protection, police,
and animal control services. However, Alternative 4 is not expected to attract enough visitors to require a
significant increase in fire protection, police protection, or animal control services or facilities. Therefore, this
impact would be less than significant.

This impact would be similar to Impact 3.12-2 (Alt. 1), but smaller in magnitude because Alternative 4 would add
fewer recreation facilities to the study area. For the same reasons as described for Alternative 1 above, this impact
would be less than significant.
Alternative 5: No-Project/No-Action
IMPACT
3.12-1
(Alt. 5)

Potential for Longer Emergency-Vehicle Response Times Caused by Roadway Obstruction during
Construction. (CEQA 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2) Because no construction activities would occur, no roadways in the
project vicinity would be obstructed, resulting in no effect on emergency response. No impact would occur.

Alternative 5 would not result in any construction activities in the study area. As a result, it would not obstruct
roadways in the project vicinity. Therefore, this alternative would not slow or stop emergency vehicles, resulting
in no effect on emergency-response times. No impact would occur.
IMPACT
3.12-2
(Alt. 5)

Potential Need for Additional Public Services or Facilities as a Result of Increased Demand for Public
Services. (CEQA 1–3; TRPA 1, 2, 4, 5) Because no additional recreation facilities would be created, no
additional visitors would be attracted to the study area, resulting in no effect on demand for fire protection,
police, and animal control services. No impact would occur.

Alternative 5 would not create additional recreation facilities in the study area. Therefore, this alternative would
not attract additional visitors to the study area. As a result, it would not cause the demand for fire protection,
police, and animal control services to increase. No impact would occur.

3.13 RECREATION
This section summarizes the regulations that address recreation in the study area, describes existing recreation
facilities and uses in the project vicinity, presents an analysis of potential impacts of Alternatives 1–5 on those
facilities and uses, and identifies mitigation measures for those impacts determined to be significant. Cumulative
recreation impacts are addressed in Section 3.18, “Cumulative Impacts.” Consistency with TRPA goals and
policies is presented in Section 3.10, “Land Use,” Table 3.10-1. The project’s effects on thresholds are described
in Section 4.5, “Consequences for Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities.”

3.13.1

AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

REGULATORY SETTING
Federal
No federal plans, policies, ordinances, laws, or regulations specific to recreation are applicable.
State
The California State Lands Commission (CSLC) regulates an established public-trust easement for navigable
waterways and for lateral access between the high and low-water lines along navigable waterways. The regulation
of this public-trust easement is described in detail in Chapter 5, “Compliance, Consultation, and Coordination.”
Tahoe Regional Planning Agency
Goals and Policies
The Goals and Policies portion of the Regional Plan (TRPA 2006) establishes an overall framework for
development and environmental conservation in the Lake Tahoe region. Chapter V (Recreation Element)
of TRPA’s Goals and Policies consists of three subelements: dispersed recreation, developed recreation,
and urban recreation. Existing and proposed recreation activities in the study area are dispersed in nature;
however, under the various alternatives, these activities would shift from dispersed closer to developed
recreation when viewed within the context of the Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (an organizing
concept that relates the level of recreation infrastructure with their common activities). Dispersed
recreation involves outdoor recreation activities that are not concentrated at a specific facility location,
but are dispersed around the study area, such as hiking, jogging, primitive camping, nature study, fishing,
cross-country skiing, rafting/kayaking, and swimming. The following goals related to dispersed recreation
are applicable to existing and proposed recreation in the study area:
►

►

Goal 1: Encourage opportunities for dispersed recreation when consistent with environmental values and
protection of the natural resources.
Goal 2: Provide high-quality recreational opportunities.

The following goals related to developed recreation are applicable to existing and proposed recreation in
the study area:
►

Goal 1: Provide a fair share of the total basin capacity for outdoor recreation.

►

Goal 2: Provide for the appropriate type, location, and rate of development of outdoor recreational uses.

►

Goal 3: Protect natural resources from overuse and rectify incompatibility between uses.

►

Goal 4: Provide for the efficient use of outdoor recreation resources.

Code of Ordinances
As described in Chapter 50 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances, TRPA regulates the rate of expansion and the
distribution of recreation use in the Lake Tahoe region by identifying targets for recreation use and regulating
development to maintain them. Targets measured in persons-at-one-time (PAOTs) have been identified for
outdoor recreation at overnight, summer day-use, and winter day-use facilities.
TRPA allocates PAOTs to plan area statements (PASs) and community plans and to a regional pool in which
PAOTs are held in reserve for overnight and summer day-use facilities (Shaw, pers. comm., 2008). If a proposed
expansion of recreation facilities meets TRPA criteria, the project will be approved, and the numerical target for
PAOTs necessary to accommodate the increased level of activity associated with the project will be set for the
project as part of the TRPA permitting process. The PAOTs required for the permitted activity will be allocated
from the PAOTs designated for the relevant PAS, community plan, or reserve pool. Through this process, TRPA
essentially grants permission for the project to increase use of the recreational facility by a particular number of
people. PAOT allocation allows agencies to quantitatively measure development of recreation facilities and to
determine how well that development is keeping pace with pressures for other urban development, such as
residential and commercial development.
A PAOT allocation would be necessary only if recreation capacity were increasing or if new facilities were
created that would be likely to attract new visitors to the Lake Tahoe region. Dispersed outdoor recreation
activities—hiking, jogging, primitive camping, nature study, fishing, cross-country skiing, rafting/kayaking, and
swimming—are not subject to PAOT allocations because these activities do not constitute “additional recreation”
as defined in the TRPA Code of Ordinances.
Unlike dispersed recreation, developed recreation facilities are likely to increase recreation capacity and require
TRPA to allocate PAOTs. Developed recreation involves activities enhanced by the use of built facilities, such as
campgrounds, marinas, and ski resorts. Some of the recreation uses proposed under the action alternatives are
classified as day-use facilities and would require day-use PAOT allocation from either the PAS in which they are
located or from the regional pool where PAOTs are not available from within the PAS.
Lake Tahoe Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan
The Lake Tahoe Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan (BPP) (TRPA 2010) was prepared by TRPA and the Tahoe
Metropolitan Planning Organization as a guide for planning, constructing, and maintaining a regional network of
bicycle paths and pedestrian trails, and supporting facilities and programs throughout the Lake Tahoe region. The
plan contains goals and policies, an analysis of demand (including a model for estimating bicycle path use along
major transportation corridors), conceptual alignments for various areas throughout the Tahoe Basin, a prioritized
list of projects, and conceptual construction cost estimates.
The following goals and policies of the BPP apply to the project:
Goal 1. Complete a bicycle and pedestrian network that provides convenient access to Basin destinations and
destinations outside the Basin.
►

Policy 1.1. To the extent possible, accommodate all users, encompassing a wide range of abilities and travel
objectives, in the bicycle and pedestrian network.

Goal 3. Provide environmental, economic, and social benefits to the region through increased bicycling and
walking.

City of South Lake Tahoe
Although the project area is located within the city limits of South Lake Tahoe, as a state agency, the
Conservancy is not subject to the CSLT’s municipal code. Nonetheless, the Conservancy’s management of the
study area conforms to the CSLT’s municipal code, and the Conservancy also contracts with the CSLT to provide
security patrols within the study area and to enforce CSLT regulations for parks. Regulations governing activities
in public parks and beaches are contained in Chapter 18A of the municipal code. The following sections of the
CSLT code require dogs to be on leashes:
►

►

Chapter 6, Animal Control. Article IV. General Regulations—Dog Controls, Section 6-22: Stray dogs
generally. It shall be unlawful for any person owning or having charge of any stray dog, as defined herein
[not under restraint by a leash], to cause, permit or allow such dogs, whether licensed or unlicensed, to stray,
wander or otherwise be at loose or at large upon any public street, alley, park, beach, way or other public
property within the city, or upon any private property within the city other than private property of which the
owner of the dog has ownership or control, unless such dog is kept securely confined by a leash, rope, cord or
chain not over 10 feet in length held by some person or securely attached to some stationary object.
Chapter 18A, Parks and Beaches. Article II. Protection of Property, Section 18A-11: Use of park and

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Recreation Facilities and Opportunities in the Study Area
Overview of Recreation Use
Recreation within the study area is dispersed and does not currently include developed facilities, except for one
trail, constructed as part of the Lower West Side Wetland Restoration Project in 2001. With the exception of this
trail, which connects East Venice Drive to Cove East Beach, the study area does not contain officially designated
trails or other facilities for recreation use. However, a network of user-created trails provides access to the study
area from adjoining neighborhoods. Similarly, user-created boat take-outs exist along the Upper Truckee River.
The study area is commonly used for walking, running, beach activities, bicycling, wildlife viewing, fishing, and
dog walking. These uses occur primarily during late spring, summer, and early fall, and in that period are greatest

during summer weekends and holidays. During summer weekends and holidays, use of the study area can exceed
100 to 300 visitors per day, but during other days, the number of visitors is much smaller. Winter outdoor
recreation use also includes cross-country skiing, snow play, and snow shoeing. Most visitors use the portion of
the study area west of the Upper Truckee River. Thus, the eastern portion of the study area provides dispersed
recreation opportunities characterized by solitude and a lack of formal facilities or infrastructure. Recreational use
of off-road vehicles is prohibited in the study area.
A report prepared for the Conservancy summarizing findings of the Upper Truckee Marsh Land Steward program
(Rozance 2007) indicates that running, walking, and dog walking are the most popular forms of recreation in the
study area, followed by beach use and bicycle riding. The policy for dog walking within the study area is for dogs
to be on leashes, except during the waterfowl breeding season (May 1 through July 31), when the area east of the
Upper Truckee River is closed to dogs. The LWS portion of the study area remains open to leashed dogs during
waterfowl breeding season. Although many dog owners do not comply with this policy, the Conservancy has
engaged in outreach and education efforts to ensure that dog owners are aware of leash laws in the area.
There are several resource management issues associated with existing recreational use of the study area. These
issues include degradation of the banks of the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek, disturbance of beach and
dune habitat occupied by Tahoe yellow cress, and disruption of wildlife use of the study area. These resource
management issues are discussed further in Section 3.4, “Biological Resources: Vegetation and Wildlife.”
Beaches and the Sailing Lagoon
The beaches within the study area (i.e., Cove East Beach, Barton Beach, and East Barton Beach) have only a
limited area for recreational activities compared with other public beaches on the West Shore south of Emerald
Bay and on the South Shore (e.g., Baldwin, Kiva, Pope, and El Dorado Beaches).
Cove East Beach is located in the western portion of the study area adjacent to and east of the Tahoe Keys Marina
(Exhibit 1-2). The multipurpose trail on the Lower West Side Wetland Restoration Project site begins at the end
of the East Venice Drive cul-de-sac, heads north toward Lake Tahoe, and loops around the perimeter of Cove East
Beach. From this trail, recreationists can access the lake, Cove East Beach, and the Sailing Lagoon adjacent to the
Tahoe Keys Marina. Users also access the beach by boat. Although the multipurpose trail and trash receptacles
are the only facilities, Cove East Beach is considered a developed beach. Cove East Beach is accessible without
an entrance fee. Visitors driving cars to the beach and study area typically park on East Venice Drive.
The Sailing Lagoon has approximately 144,000 square feet of water surface area and is connected to the Tahoe
Keys Marina. It is used for small-craft sailing and recreational fishing.
Barton Beach is an undeveloped beach between the mouth of the Upper Truckee River and East Barton Beach.
The beach is accessed from the east by way of East Barton Beach, as well as by boat. There are no facilities on the
beach, but there is a user-created trail south of the beach that runs parallel to it.
A user-created network of trails provides access to East Barton Beach. Some trails have been established across
private property; however, it is possible to access East Barton Beach via trails located on public property owned
by the State of California and managed by the Conservancy. These trails are accessed via connections to the Al
Tahoe and Highland Woods residential subdivisions adjacent to this portion of the marsh. The closest access point
to East Barton Beach that is entirely on public land is at the end of San Francisco Avenue in the Al Tahoe
neighborhood.
Approximately half of East Barton Beach is excluded from public access by a fenced exclosure that is maintained
for the protection of Tahoe yellow cress. However, outside of the exclosure, a network of user-created trails exists
in this area.

Recreation

River and Marsh
The Upper Truckee River is used seasonally, primarily during spring runoff periods and summer, for
nonmotorized watercraft activities, including kayaking, canoeing, tubing, and boat fishing. Other river uses in the
warmer months include swimming, shore fishing, and relaxing along the banks of the river. There are no formal
or designated access points to the river within the study area. Recreationists most often access this section of the
river by entering the river at various locations upstream of the U.S. 50 bridge, such as floating the river from Elks
Club Drive. The East Venice Drive cul-de-sac is used as a user-created put in/take out point for kayaks, canoes,
and tubes.
A user-created trail network provides access to the marsh area from the Al Tahoe neighborhood to the east and
Tahoe Keys to the west. There are several access points for the trail system from these neighborhoods, many of
which are on private property. Recreational activities in this portion of the study area include dog walking, hiking,
jogging, and nature viewing.
During the late fall, winter, and spring when the snow reaches sufficient depths, visitors to the marsh travel on
snowshoes or cross-country skis. CSLT regulations, discussed above, prohibit the use of snowmobiles within the
marsh.
Dogs are allowed in the publicly owned portions of the study area, but are required by CSLT ordinances to be
leashed. Signage encouraging users to keep dogs on leashes, including mention of relevant ordinances, is posted
at various official entrances to the site, including those located at Cove East Beach, Tahoe Island/Sky Meadows,
and Al Tahoe. “Mutt mitts” for dog-waste collection and trash cans are also located at these locations. Unleashed
dogs are a recognized issue for recreation use management in the study area.
Recreation Facilities and Opportunities in the Vicinity of the Study Area
Recreation opportunities in the vicinity of the study area (i.e., in the southwestern portion of the Tahoe Basin) are
abundant and diverse. These activities include those associated with the lake’s open water (e.g., swimming,
boating, use of personal watercraft, fishing), shoreline (e.g., sunbathing, camping, bicycling, sightseeing), river
recreation (e.g., fishing, paddling, swimming), and the terrain surrounding the lake (e.g., hiking, wilderness
camping, mountain biking, skiing, snowboarding). A substantial amount of public land is available for outdoor
recreation in the vicinity, including National Forest System land, state parks, and other state and local-government
lands.
Parks, Beaches, and Campgrounds
Several parks, beaches, and campgrounds exist near the study area, in the southwestern portion of the Tahoe
Basin. South Shore beaches are listed in Table 3.13-1. Regan Beach is adjacent to the Al Tahoe neighborhood and
east of the study area. This beach includes parking, lake access, a snack bar, picnic area, volleyball court, and a
grassy area for picnicking and lounging.
The El Dorado Recreation Area is a CSLT recreation facility that includes El Dorado Beach and a boat ramp
north of U.S. 50 and a camping area south of U.S. 50. A Class I bicycle path is adjacent to El Dorado Beach,
providing bicyclists and pedestrians from surrounding areas a convenient way to access this beach. Farther south,
off Al Tahoe Boulevard, is Bijou Community Park and an area designated by the CSLT for use as a dog park.
Pope Beach is a U.S. Forest Service (USFS) facility located west of the Tahoe Keys subdivision and has parking,
picnic areas, and beach access. Farther west are other USFS facilities: Kiva Beach, Camp Richardson, and
Baldwin Beach. Camp Richardson is a fully developed campground with beach access, camping, and commercial
venues. A Class I bicycle path serves the area from Pope Beach to Baldwin Beach from the 15th Street bicycle
path and bridge on the westernmost boundary of the incorporated City limits.

Open Space and Trails
Abundant open space exists in the project vicinity, primarily on USFS land southwest of the study area in the
vicinity of Fallen Leaf Lake and on the south side of Pioneer Trail. There are numerous hiking trails and paths for
bicycling located throughout the USFS lands. Another publicly-owned open space area with a trail system is
located between the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek, south of Pioneer Trail.
A system of bicycle paths serves the perimeter of the study area. On the east side of the study area, a Class II
bicycle lane on Lakeview Avenue connects to a Class III bicycle route that follows Bellevue Avenue and
El Dorado Avenue, ending at Oakland Avenue. The west side of the study area is served by a Class II bicycle lane
on Tahoe Keys Boulevard and a Class II bicycle route on East Venice Drive. On the south side of the study area, a
combination of Class I bicycle path and Class III bicycle route segments connects to El Dorado Beach to the east
and the “wye” (the intersection of U.S. 50 and Highway 89) and Camp Richardson to the west. These path
segments south of the study area are in the “South Y to Al Tahoe” corridor, which is one of the 22 major corridors
for bicycle and pedestrian travel in the Tahoe Basin identified in the BPP (TRPA 2010).
Tahoe Keys Marina
Tahoe Keys Marina is a privately-owned, full-service marina and boat-launching facility adjacent to the study
area. The Marina is the largest marina on the lake and is open year-round, offering indoor and outdoor, wet and
dry dock storage with over 280 slips, including a double inland concrete launch ramp (TRPA 2002). The launch
ramp is open to the public for a launch fee. The Marina also provides a restaurant, chandlery/mini-mart,
restrooms, gas dock, a certified Marine Service Department, and boat-lifting facilities. In addition to boatingrelated services, the Tahoe Keys Marina offers other recreational services through the Sport Fishing and Charter
Fleet. These services include balloon rides, fishing and sailing charters, and sailing lessons (TRPA 2002). During
the summer, boaters using the launch ramp park their vehicles and trailers both inside the marina parking lot and
on the street along East Venice Drive. The channel connecting the Tahoe Keys Marina to the lake is along the
northeastern boundary of the study area. The Sailing Lagoon is currently connected to this channel. The Tahoe
Keys Master Plan (2002) proposes to expand parking and boat storage facilities, relocate smaller boat slips, and
upgrade channel markers, signage, and restraints.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES AND MITIGATION MEASURES

SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA
CEQA Criteria
Under CEQA, an alternative was determined to result in a significant effect related to recreation if it would:
►

►

►

increase the use of existing neighborhood and regional parks or other recreational facilities such that
substantial physical deterioration of the facility would occur or be accelerated (CEQA 1),
include recreational facilities or require the construction or expansion of recreational facilities that might have
an adverse physical effect on the environment (CEQA 2), or
preclude existing recreation activities within the project study area (CEQA 3).

These criteria are based on the checklist presented in Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines.
NEPA Criteria
An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the
environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the proposed action. Under NEPA, the significance
of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account
under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are
encompassed by the CEQA criteria used for this analysis.
TRPA Criteria
Based on TRPA’s Initial Environmental Checklist, an alternative would result in significant recreation impact if it
would:
►
►
►

result in conflicts with regional PAOT objectives (TRPA 1);
result in conflicts between recreation uses, either existing or proposed (TRPA 2); or
result in a decrease or loss of public access to any lake, waterway, or public lands (TRPA 3).

In development of mitigation measures for significant impacts of the project, effects on environmental threshold
carrying capacities (thresholds) of the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact were considered. The project’s effects
on thresholds are described in Section 4.5, “Consequences for Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities.”

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
The alternatives could cause short-term and long-term effects on recreation resources and activities. Short term
construction activities would involve loading and unloading of haul trucks, operation of earth-moving equipment,
and other types of noise and disturbance that could reduce public access or recreational opportunities during the
construction season (May 1–October 15) over a four-year construction schedule.
Long-term effects on recreation resources and activities would result from providing infrastructure that changes the
spectrum of recreation settings from dispersed to more developed and from altering accessibility throughout the site
to varying degrees, depending on the alternative, which may lead to an increase in visitors within the project study
area. As described in Chapter 2, “Project Alternatives,” the action alternatives were developed to balance recreation
and public access with ecosystem restoration and habitat protection. This balance would be attained by providing

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Recreation

3.13-8

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

well-designed public access and recreation facilities in nonsensitive areas and habitat protective elements and
environmental education to direct use away from sensitive areas.
The evaluation of long-term effects of the alternatives must consider the potential increase of recreational visitors to
the study area. The study area would not be advertised by the Conservancy as a destination and would include no
commercial activities. However, recreation use could increase proportionally to the change in the amount and
connectivity of public access- and recreation-related infrastructure, because the proposed infrastructure would affect
(increase) the accessibility of the project study area to recreational users. A record of precise counts of visitors does
not exist for the study area, although the Conservancy has a comprehensive qualitative understanding of recreation
use from staff observations and the activities of a site steward during summer months. Without a quantified
inventory record of visitors, it is not feasible to develop precise quantitative estimates of changes in recreation users
for each alternative. However, qualitative assessment is feasible based on the relative degree of proposed recreation
and access infrastructure for each alternative. Based on this qualitative assessment of the alternatives relative to each
other, implementing Alternative 2 (minimal recreation infrastructure) is expected to result in the least increase in
visitation. Implementing Alternative 1 (maximum recreation infrastructure) would result in the greatest increase in
visitation, and implementing Alternative 3 or 4 (moderate recreation infrastructure) would result in an intermediate
increase, between Alternatives 1 and 2 in magnitude, but negligibly different between Alternatives 3 and 4. The
potential increase in the number of visitors is not considered to be substantial enough to create new or unmitigable
impacts on recreation resources (impacts on other resource areas notwithstanding) for the following reasons:
(1) The recreation and public access elements of the alternatives are related to reducing the impacts on natural
resources of the existing use of the study area.
(2) The most popular recreational uses of the study area are dispersed outdoor recreation. The Tahoe Basin
has an abundance of locations where people can engage in the same recreation activities on public lands;
thus, there is not a substantial unmet demand for such recreational opportunities.
(3) Even though the action alternatives would move recreational uses from dispersed toward developed
outdoor recreation (with Alternative 1 having the most change), the recreation uses proposed are not
categorically fully-developed facilities (e.g., campgrounds, marinas), and the increase in the number of
visitors would not be similar to the increase associated with those uses.
(4) Adjacent neighborhoods account for a substantial portion of visitors to the study area, and implementing
the project would not alter the number of residents in adjacent neighborhoods or substantially alter access
to the study area from adjacent neighborhoods.
Nonetheless, several aspects of the proposed public access infrastructure could increase the number of visitors to
the study area. For example, several existing trail surfaces may be modified with pavement, boardwalk, or other
hardscape materials that would result in a greater level of accessibility to a broader spectrum of potential users
and therefore could increase trail use and thus visitation to the study area (in a manner analogous to the
“maintenance” factor in the Tahoe Bike Trail User Model [LSC Transportation Consultants 2009]). Information
related to the existing and anticipated numbers of visitors is provided in Section 3.16, “Transportation, Parking,
and Circulation.”

Alternative 1: Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
IMPACT
3.13-1
(Alt. 1)

Short-Term Increase in Use of Surrounding Neighborhood and Regional Parks and Recreation
Facilities during Construction. (CEQA 1) Construction activities associated with Alternative 1 would require
portions of the study area to be closed temporarily at various times during the four-year-long construction
period. As described in Environmental Commitment 13, the Conservancy would prepare a Public Outreach
Plan. The plan would identify strategies to inform the general public and partnering agencies of access
restrictions and their anticipated timelines, alternate locations for passive recreation activities, and site access
information. Recreation activities in portions of the study area would be temporarily disrupted as a result of
construction. However, all of those recreation activities could be accommodated on the surrounding beaches,
parks, and public open spaces without causing or accelerating any substantial physical deterioration of the
existing facilities. Therefore, construction of Alternative 1 is not expected to increase the use of surrounding
parks or other recreation facilities enough to either result in substantial physical deterioration of those facilities
or accelerate such deterioration. This impact would be less than significant.

Construction activities associated with Alternative 1 would require short-term closure of portions of the study area
at various times. Although the study area is not considered an existing park or recreation facility, dispersed
recreation activities do occur throughout the study area, and those activities would be displaced during project
construction. Although there is a four-year-long construction schedule, construction phasing would be designed so
that recreation access would be made available where and when safe access is available. As described in
Environmental Commitment (EC) 13, “Prepare and Implement a Public Outreach Plan” (Table 2-6), the
Conservancy would prepare a Public Outreach Plan that identifies strategies to inform the general public and
partnering agencies of access restrictions and their anticipated timelines, alternate locations for passive recreation
activities, and site access information. Communication of this information may be through signage at access
points, messages posted to the Conservancy website, public service announcements, and news articles in the local
and regional newspapers.
The study area is near other public beaches on the south and west shores of Lake Tahoe, and is close to public
lands that provide similar dispersed recreation opportunities (see “Environmental Setting” in Section 3.13.1). Data
collected by the Conservancy’s Upper Truckee Marsh Land Steward program (UTMLS) indicate that the primary
recreational uses of the marsh are walking, running, dog walking, beach use, and bicycle riding (Rozance 2007).
All of these uses can be accommodated on the surrounding beaches, parks, and public open spaces. Data collected
by the Conservancy indicate that during peak use (i.e., summer weekends and holidays), 100 to 300 people per
day have visited the marsh, but that the number of visitors is much less at other times. It is reasonable to expect
that visitors would use several alternative locations if the marsh were not available during construction of
Alternative 1; thus, only a small increase in users would be experienced at surrounding facilities and only during
the construction period. Given the low-impact nature of dispersed recreation activities and the small number of
recreationists who would be displaced during construction, it is not anticipated that this would cause or accelerate
any substantial physical deterioration of surrounding facilities. Because the Conservancy will provide outreach
and recreation access information for the study area and because alternate locations for dispersed recreation can
support existing study area recreationists during construction, this impact would be less than significant.

Short-Term Construction Impacts of Recreation Facilities That May Have an Adverse Physical Effect
on the Environment. (CEQA 2) The short-term impacts of constructing the project’s recreation facilities are
analyzed in the various resource sections of this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS. Alternative 1 has short-term construction
impacts on wildlife, and water quality, as discussed in Section 3.4, “Biological Resources: Vegetation and
Wildlife and Section 3.9, “Geomorphology and Water Quality.” Therefore, the physical effect of constructing
recreation facilities under Alternative 1 would be potentially significant.

The short-term impacts of constructing the project’s recreation facilities are analyzed in the various resource
sections of this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS. Construction of recreational facilities in Alternative 1 has short-term
construction impacts on wildlife and water quality, as discussed in Section 3.4, “Biological Resources: Vegetation
and Wildlife and Section 3.9, “Geomorphology and Water Quality.” Environmental Commitments (Table 2-6)
and mitigation measures have been established to lessen these impacts to the extent feasible. These impacts would
be potentially significant.
Beyond Environmental Commitments described in Table 2-6, the following mitigation measures for the relevant
impacts would be implemented:
Mitigation Measure 3.4-8A (Alt. 1): Conduct Preconstruction Surveys for Nesting Special-Status Birds (Yellow
Warbler, Willow Flycatcher, Waterfowl, and Long-Eared Owl) and Implement Buffers If Necessary.
Described in Section 3.4.
Mitigation Measure 3.4-8B (Alt. 1): Conduct Preconstruction Surveys for Special-Status Bats, Avoid Removal of
Important Roosts, and Implement a Limited Operating Period If Necessary.
Described in Section 3.4.
Significance after Mitigation: With implementation of the measures described above, the short term
construction impacts of recreation facilities on the environment would be minimized; however, all impacts could
not be fully mitigated. Therefore, the impact of constructing recreation facilities would be significant and
unavoidable.
IMPACT
3.13-3
(Alt. 1)

Short-Term Decrease or Loss of Public Access and Recreation Opportunities within Lakes,
Waterways, or Public Land during Construction. (CEQA 3; TRPA 2, 3) Closure of portions of the study
area during construction would have a short-term effect on recreation opportunities and access to the Upper
Truckee River and marsh in the study area. However, alternate opportunities for dispersed recreation are
abundant in the project vicinity and elsewhere in the Tahoe Basin. Many opportunities are located near the
marsh, such as at Regan Beach, at El Dorado Recreation Area, and on other public lands. The east channel
of the Tahoe Keys Marina would be affected by removal of the Sailing Lagoon; however, as described in
Environmental Commitments 13 and 14, the Conservancy would prepare a Public Outreach Plan and
Waterway Traffic Control Plan to address boater and other recreation access conflicts. Because construction
would be short-term, waterway conflicts would be managed, and multiple dispersed recreation facilities would
be available in the vicinity, implementation of Alternative 1 is not expected to substantially reduce or preclude
existing recreation opportunities or access to lakes, waterways, or public lands. This impact would be less
than significant.

Closure of portions of the study area including closure to boating of sections of the Upper Truckee River and
restricted access in the east channel of the Tahoe Keys Marina at the Sailing Lagoon would have a short-term
impact on recreation opportunities and access locally. However, because of the considerable amount of publiclyheld land in the Tahoe Basin, including areas adjacent to rivers and lakes, regional recreation facilities could
absorb the displacement of recreational activity from the study area. The primary recreation activities that would
be temporarily displaced by construction activities for Alternative 1 would be walking, bicycling, fishing, dog
walking, sunbathing, swimming, and boating; these activities would be compatible with existing recreational
activities at other public lands in the Tahoe Basin. To the extent feasible and without compromising health and
safety, portions of the study area could remain accessible to members of the public on a very limited basis. The
accessibility of the area would vary depending on the stages of active construction, hauling of materials, and
revegetation efforts that may require closure of areas until plantings are established. As described in EC 13,
“Prepare and Implement a Public Outreach Plan,” and EC 14, “Prepare and Implement a Waterway Traffic
Control Plan for Alternatives That Affect the Sailing Lagoon” (Table 2-6), the Conservancy would prepare a

Public Outreach Plan and Water Traffic Control Plan to address safety, accessibility, and other recreation
opportunities. Because the Conservancy will provide outreach and recreation access information for the study area
and alternate locations for dispersed recreation can support existing study area recreationists during construction,
this impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.13-4
(Alt. 1)

Long-Term Change in Use of Surrounding Neighborhood and Regional Parks and Recreation
Facilities. (CEQA 1) Implementation of Alternative 1 is not expected to increase the use of existing parks or
other recreation facilities enough to either result in substantial physical deterioration of the facility or
accelerate such deterioration. Once the facilities are constructed under this alternative, there would likely be
an increase in the number of visitors to the study area because bridge, boardwalk, bike path, and ADA
pedestrian trail improvements would attract a more diverse group of visitors. Alternative 1 would provide
sufficient facilities for visitors to prevent physical deterioration of facilities surrounding the study area. Thus,
the potential increase in use of the study area would not result in substantial physical deterioration of
surrounding facilities. In addition, disconnecting the Sailing Lagoon from the east channel of the Tahoe Keys
as proposed under Alternative 1 would not substantially affect the movement of boat traffic into and out of the
marina because the channel would not be narrowed and boats could continue to move into and out of the
channel. This impact would be less than significant.

The features of Alternative 1 that would modify the Upper Truckee River, its floodplain, and the marsh (i.e.,
raising and reconfiguring a portion of the main channel, reconfiguring two sections of split channel, and reducing
the capacity of the river mouth) would not have any substantial, long-term impacts on surrounding recreation
facilities or parks.
Alternative 1 proposes the “maximum” recreation infrastructure (compared to the other alternatives), including
kiosks, stabilization of an existing river boat take-out, observation platforms, bridges across the Upper Truckee
River and Trout Creek, boardwalks and trails, and bicycle paths. Design of public access and recreation
infrastructure under Alternative 1 focuses on maintaining existing recreation opportunities, and reducing effects of
recreational use on sensitive resources. However, these improvements, including ADA trail improvements, could
attract a more diverse group of visitors, and Alternative 1 moves more toward developed recreation than the other
alternatives.
Although the number of visitors to the study area would likely increase as a result of the project, neither a
considerable increase in visitors to the Tahoe Basin nor an associated increase in use of other existing parks and
recreation facilities outside the study area would be likely because Alternative 1 proposes infrastructure to support
these uses. Therefore, any increase in visitors is not expected to cause physical deterioration of surrounding
recreation facilities.
Although disconnecting the Sailing Lagoon from the east channel of the Tahoe Keys could potentially affect boat
traffic into and out of the marina, the effect on passage would not be substantial. Under existing conditions, the
Sailing Lagoon offers boaters with small watercraft the option to use a sheltered area for boating. Additionally,
the Sailing Lagoon provides a location for small boats to pull out of the marina channel to allow larger boats to
pass. However, the placement of the bulkhead isolating the Sailing Lagoon would not narrow the east channel of
the marina; rather, it would be 30 feet east of the existing bulkhead, so most boats could continue to pass each
other in the existing channel. The east channel extends both south and west of its existing connection to the
Sailing Lagoon and provides the option for boats to move out of the path of other boats in the absence of the
Sailing Lagoon. Therefore, disconnecting the Sailing Lagoon from the east channel of the Tahoe Keys would not
substantially affect boat traffic into and out of the marina. This impact would be less than significant.

(Alt. 1)

Long-Term Operation and Expansion of Recreation Facilities That May Have an Adverse Physical
Effect on the Environment. (CEQA 2) The recreation facilities associated with Alternative 1 may result in
adverse physical effects on the environment. The recreation facilities associated with Alternative 1 are
designed to preserve the natural resources in the study area while providing compatible recreational
opportunities, public access, and recreational infrastructure intended to reduce adverse physical effects on
the environment by redirecting use from sensitive to less sensitive areas. However, the boardwalk and bridge
would likely attract more visitors than the other alternatives, potentially becoming an attraction, and may lead
to negative impacts on the Tahoe yellow cress population because visitors might leave the boardwalk and
walk on the beach. Thus, this effect would be potentially significant.

The locations of the recreation facilities under Alternative 1 have been designed to minimize adverse physical
effects on the environment by removing user-created trails in the core habitat area and focusing recreation
opportunities in less sensitive areas. The proposed kiosks and parking area would be located near other
compatible uses and outside of sensitive habitat areas. Other proposed recreation facilities would be located
primarily along the perimeter of the study area outside of the core habitat area. In the eastern and southern
portions of the study area, bicycle paths, observation areas, and signage should discourage foot and bicycle traffic
in sensitive areas and thus reduce the environmental impacts of existing recreational use.
In the northern portion of the study area, however, the boardwalk and bridge included in Alternative 1 would
adversely affect the population of Tahoe yellow cress, a species state listed as endangered, that occupies Barton
Beach. Alternative 1 includes a proposed new multi-use trail connection across the northern end of the marsh just
behind the study area’s beaches with a raised boardwalk and bridge over the Upper Truckee River. The proposed
bridge would be elevated sufficiently to be prominently visible from the lake. The trail link is not a major regional
trail connection feature; the link is not included in the Lake Tahoe Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan (TRPA 2010).
This trail would be the first and only boardwalk and bridge on the edge of the south shore of Lake Tahoe—a
possible attraction in and of itself, regardless of poor connectivity to the regional trail network, because 75% of
summertime Tahoe visitors engage in beach activities (TRPA 2001). This new access to Barton Beach would
create negative impacts on the population of Tahoe yellow cress by disturbing habitat and trampling Tahoe yellow
cress plants. The Conservancy’s Tahoe yellow cress management plan for the study area includes management
measures to reduce the adverse effects of recreational use and would be implemented as a component of
Alternative 1, but these measures would not be sufficient to prevent a substantial effect on Tahoe yellow cress.
Given the anticipated attraction of additional recreational users by this boardwalk and bridge, coupled with its colocation with a Tahoe yellow cress population and scenic lake views, this impact would be significant.
All feasible management measures to reduce effects on Tahoe yellow cress have been included in the
Conservancy’s Tahoe yellow cress management plan for the study area and would be implemented as a
component of Alternative 1. Alternative designs may be able to keep a substantial number of persons on the
boardwalk (e.g., a higher railing or trail elevated higher off the ground). Such design features, however, would
further exacerbate the already unmitigable scenic resource impacts of the current conceptual design. It is not
possible to quantify the increased visitation to the study area associated with this infrastructure, nor can the
number of visitors that attempt to leave the boardwalk be determined. Because no feasible mitigation exists, this
impact would remain significant and unavoidable.

(Alt. 1)

Long-Term Decrease or Loss of Public Access and Recreation Opportunities within Lakes,
Waterways, or Public Lands. (CEQA 3; TRPA 2, 3) Under Alternative 1, some user-created trails would be
decommissioned to redirect visitors out of the core habitat area. This change would limit access in the core
area adjacent to the Upper Truckee River; however, a bridge, boardwalk, and trails would provide additional
access over the river, providing a connection that was not previously available. Implementation of
Alternative 1 would not substantially reduce dispersed recreation opportunities or access in the long term, but
the additional infrastructure would create more developed recreation opportunities. In addition, disconnecting
the Sailing Lagoon from the east channel of the Tahoe Keys as proposed under Alternative 1 would not
substantially affect the movement of boat traffic into and out of the Marina. This impact would be less than
significant.

Under Alternative 1, some user-created trails would be decommissioned (see Exhibit 3.6-2 for their locations) to
redirect visitors out of the core habitat area. This change would limit access in the core habitat area adjacent to the
Upper Truckee River. The study area would continue to provide opportunities for dispersed recreation, and, a
bridge, boardwalk, and trails would provide additional access over the river, providing a connection that was not
previously available. Furthermore, amenities provided under Alternative 1—kiosks, parking, stabilized existing
boat take-out, viewpoints, observation areas, improved trail and bicycle path surfaces and a boardwalk, bridges
over Trout Creek and the Upper Truckee River, and interpretive signage—would increase the access of visitors to
existing recreation opportunities in the study area. The recreation uses proposed for the study area are not
expected to change from existing uses, which typically include hiking, biking, fishing, sunbathing, boating,
swimming, picnicking, cross-country skiing, wildlife viewing, and dog walking. Additional recreation
infrastructure includes clear directions to available facilities (signage), scenic viewpoints and observation areas,
and interpretive opportunities to learn about sensitive wildlife and habitats. The bridge and boardwalk together are
considered a public access feature, and this feature would provide new visual access to Barton Beach, the Upper
Truckee River and Lake Tahoe for trail users. Therefore, under Alternative 1, the study area would continue to
provide recreational opportunities and access to lakes, waterways, and public lands. As described in Impact 3.13-3
(Alt. 1) above, although disconnecting the Sailing Lagoon from the east channel of the Tahoe Keys could
potentially affect boat traffic into and out of the marina, the effect on boat passage would not be substantial. This
impact would be less than significant.

(Alt. 1)

Conflicts with Regional PAOT Allocations. (TRPA 1) Implementation of Alternative 1 would include bridges
across the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek, designated trails, bicycle paths, boardwalks, observation
areas, and a fishing platform. As shown in Section 3.10, “Land Use,” Table 3.10-8, summer day uses
associated with Alternative 1 would require PAOT allocations. Because plan areas associated with the study
area do not have available PAOTs, they would need to be obtained from the regional pool. Because
Alternative 1 is an Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) project and uses would be consistent with the
Regional Plan and Code of Ordinances, PAOTs could be allocated from the regional pool. This impact would
be less than significant.

(Alt. 2)

Short-Term Increase in Use of Surrounding Neighborhood and Regional Parks and Recreation
Facilities during Construction. (CEQA 1) Construction activities associated with Alternative 2 would require
portions of the study area to be closed temporarily at various times during the four-year-long construction
period. As described in Environmental Commitment 13, the Conservancy would prepare a Public Outreach
Plan. The plan would identify strategies to inform the general public and partnering agencies of access
restrictions and their anticipated timelines, alternate locations for passive recreation activities, and site access
information. Recreation activities in portions of the study area would be temporarily disrupted as a result of
construction. However, all of those recreation activities could be accommodated on the surrounding beaches,
parks, and public open spaces without causing or accelerating any substantial physical deterioration of the
existing facilities. Therefore, construction of Alternative 2 is not expected to increase the use of surrounding
parks or other recreation facilities enough to either result in substantial physical deterioration of those facilities
or accelerate such deterioration. This impact would be less than significant.

This impact is similar to, but less than, Impact 3.13-1 (Alt. 1) above. The types of construction activities and the
duration of construction under Alternative 2 would be similar to those under Alternative 1 but less extensive
outside of the corridor along the Upper Truckee River (e.g., no boardwalk, no bicycle paths, and only one vertical
grade control). As described in EC 13 (Table 2-6), the Conservancy would prepare a Public Outreach Plan. The
plan would identify strategies to inform the general public and partnering agencies of access restrictions and their
anticipated timelines, alternate locations for passive recreation activities, and site access information. Because the
Conservancy would provide outreach and recreation access information for the study area, and because alternate
locations for dispersed recreation could support existing study area recreationists during construction, this impact
would be less than significant.

Short-Term Construction Impacts of Recreation Facilities That May Have an Adverse Physical Effect
on the Environment. (CEQA 2) The short-term impacts of constructing the project’s recreation facilities are
analyzed in the various resource sections of this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS. Alternative 2 has short-term construction
impacts on wildlife and water quality, as discussed in Section 3.4, “Biological Resources: Vegetation and
Wildlife and Section 3.9, “Geomorphology and Water Quality.” Therefore, the physical effect of constructing
recreation facilities under Alternative 2 would be significant and unavoidable.

This impact is similar to but less than Impact 3.13-2 (Alt. 1) above. Alternative 2 is a minimum recreation
infrastructure alternative and has considerably fewer recreation facilities than Alternative 1 (maximum
recreation).The short-term impacts of constructing the project’s recreation facilities are analyzed in the various
resource sections of this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS. Alternative 2 has short-term construction impacts on wildlife and
water quality, as discussed in Section 3.4, “Biological Resources: Vegetation and Wildlife and Section 3.9,
“Geomorphology and Water Quality.”
Environmental Commitments (Table 2-6) and mitigation measures have been established to lessen these impacts
to the extent feasible. These impacts would be potentially significant.
Beyond Environmental Commitments described in Table 2-6, the following mitigation measures for the relevant
impacts would be implemented:
Mitigation Measure 3.4-8A (Alt. 2): Conduct Preconstruction Surveys for Nesting Special-Status Birds (Yellow
Warbler, Willow Flycatcher, Waterfowl, and Long-Eared Owl), and Implement Buffers If Necessary.
Described in Section 3.4.

IMPACT
3.13-3
(Alt. 2)

Short-Term Decrease or Loss of Public Access and Recreation Opportunities within Lakes,
Waterways, or Public Land during Construction. (CEQA 3; TRPA 2, 3) Closure of portions of the study
area during construction would have a short-term effect on recreation opportunities and access to the Upper
Truckee River and marsh in the study area. However, alternate opportunities for dispersed recreation are
abundant in the project vicinity and elsewhere in the Tahoe Basin. Many opportunities are located near the
marsh, such as at Regan Beach, at El Dorado Recreation Area, and on other public lands. The east channel
of the Tahoe Keys Marina would be affected by removal of the Sailing Lagoon; however, as described in
Environmental Commitments 13 and 14, the Conservancy would prepare a Public Outreach Plan and
Waterway Traffic Control Plan to address boater and other recreation access conflicts. Because construction
would be short-term, waterway conflicts would be managed, and multiple dispersed recreation facilities would
be available in the vicinity, implementation of Alternative 2 is not expected to substantially reduce or preclude
existing recreation opportunities or access to lakes, waterways, or public lands. This impact would be less
than significant.

This impact is similar to but less than Impact 3.13-3 (Alt. 1) above. The types of construction activities and the
duration of construction under Alternative 2 would be similar to those under Alternative 1, but recreation-related
construction activities would be less extensive outside of the corridor along the Upper Truckee River. The east
channel of the Tahoe Keys Marina would be affected by removal of the Sailing Lagoon, and river access to Lake
Tahoe would not be available in the study area during construction. Construction phasing would be designed so
that recreation access would be made available where and when safe access is available. As described in ECs 13
and 14 (Table 2-6), the Conservancy would prepare a Public Outreach Plan and Waterway Traffic Control Plan to
address boater conflicts, trail closures, and other recreation opportunities. Because the Conservancy would
provide traffic control for the marina, it would provide outreach and recreation access information for the study
area, and alternate locations for dispersed recreation could support existing study area recreationists during
construction, this impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.13-4
(Alt. 2)

Long-Term Change in Use of Surrounding Neighborhood and Regional Parks and Recreation
Facilities. (CEQA 1) Implementation of Alternative 2 is not expected to increase the use of existing parks or
other recreation facilities enough to either result in substantial physical deterioration of the facility or
accelerate such deterioration. The minimal recreation infrastructure of Alternative 2 would attract fewer new
visitors to the study area as compared to Alternative 1 because Alternative 2 proposes fewer infrastructure
improvements. The increase in use would primarily result from the redistribution of some visitors from existing
facilities to the study area. The potential increase in use of the study area would not result in substantial
physical deterioration of surrounding facilities because proposed facilities are intended to support those uses.
Also, disconnecting the Sailing Lagoon from the east channel of the Tahoe Keys as proposed under
Alternative 2 would not substantially affect the movement of boat traffic into and out of the Marina. This impact
would be less than significant.

This impact is similar to but less than Impact 3.13-6 (Alt. 1). Recreation components of Alternative 2 include
rerouting of an existing recreational trail over a new bulkhead at the Sailing Lagoon, construction of a fishing
platform, viewpoints, and development of an interpretive program and signage. This minimal recreation
infrastructure would attract few new visitors to the study area because the types of recreational opportunities
would remain similar to existing conditions, and the elements of Alternative 2 would provide few attractions
compared to existing facilities. The increase in use would primarily result from a small redistribution of
recreational use from existing facilities to the study area, and thus, an increased use of existing neighborhood and

regional parks or recreation facilities is not a likely outcome. Also, as described for Alternative 1, disconnecting
the Sailing Lagoon from the east channel of the Tahoe Keys would not substantially affect boat traffic into and
out of the marina because the channel would not be narrowed by the new bulkhead, and options for a boat to idle
and wait or to move out of the path of other boats would continue to exist in the absence of the Sailing Lagoon.
This impact would be less than significant.

Long-Term Operation and Expansion of Recreation Facilities That May Have an Adverse Physical
Effect on the Environment. (CEQA 2) The recreation facilities associated with Alternative 2 are not expected
to result in adverse physical effects on the environment. The recreation facilities associated with Alternative 2
are designed to preserve the natural resources in the study area while providing dispersed recreational
opportunities. Public access and recreation infrastructure would reduce adverse physical effects on the
environment by redirecting use from sensitive to less sensitive areas. This impact would be less than
significant.

This effect is substantially less than the effect anticipated under Impact 3.13-5 (Alt. 1) above because Alternative
2 contains fewer public access and recreation infrastructure elements than Alternative 1. Specifically, the bridge
and boardwalk are not proposed under Alternative 2; therefore, a new beach attraction would not be established.
As described throughout this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS, all potential impacts associated with long-term use of the study
area under Alternative 2 would be mitigated to a less-than-significant level. This effect would be less than
significant.
IMPACT
3.13-6
(Alt. 2)

Long-Term Decrease or Loss of Public Access and Recreation Opportunities within Lakes,
Waterways, or Public Lands. (CEQA 3; TRPA 2, 3) Under Alternative 2, some user-created trails would be
decommissioned to redirect visitors out of the core habitat area. However, dispersed recreation opportunities
would continue elsewhere within the study area. Furthermore, additional access to some types of dispersed
recreation opportunities would result from the provision of designated facilities and recreation-related
infrastructure. This impact would be less than significant.

For the same reasons as described for Impact 3.13-6 (Alt. 1), Alternative 2 would continue to provide dispersed
recreation opportunities outside of the core habitat area and provide new access to some recreation opportunities
relative to existing conditions. The infrastructure installed (which is related to the extent of the alternative’s
recreation infrastructure and public access elements) would be less than under Alternative 1. As described in
Impact 3.13-4 (Alt. 2) above, disconnecting the Sailing Lagoon from the east channel of the Tahoe Keys would not
substantially affect boat traffic into and out of the marina, and safe movement into and out of the marina would

Long-Term Change in Use of Surrounding Neighborhood and Regional Parks and Recreation
Facilities. (CEQA 1) Implementation of Alternative 3 is not expected to increase the use of existing parks or
other recreation facilities enough to either result in substantial physical deterioration of the facility or
accelerate such deterioration. Once the facilities are constructed under this alternative, there could be an
increase in the number of visitors because Alternative 3 would provide additional recreation-related
infrastructure that facilitates access. This increase would primarily result from a small redistribution of
recreational use from existing facilities to the study area, and thus, an increased use of surrounding
neighborhood, regional parks and recreation facilities is not a likely outcome. Furthermore, Alternative 3 would
provide sufficient facilities for the anticipated volume of visitors to the study area. Thus, the potential increase
in use would not result in substantial physical deterioration of existing facilities. Also, disconnecting the Sailing

Alternative 1. This increase would result primarily from a redistribution of recreational use from existing facilities
to the study area, and thus, an increased use of existing facilities outside of the study area is not a likely outcome.
Furthermore, sufficient recreation facilities would exist in the study area to accommodate this increase in visitors

decommissioned to redirect visitors out of the core habitat area. This change would limit access in the core
area adjacent to the Upper Truckee River; however, implementation of Alternative 3 would not preclude
dispersed recreation opportunities in the long term relative to existing conditions. Additional recreation
opportunities may result from the provision of designated facilities and recreation-related infrastructure that
would move recreation opportunities more toward the developed end of the recreation opportunities spectrum.
Access to the study area via nonmotorized water craft would change because of the new distributary channel
design but would still be possible depending on hydrologic conditions. Furthermore, there are abundant
nonmotorized boating opportunities in Lake Tahoe and along the Upper Truckee River outside of the study
area. This impact would be less than significant.

For the same reasons as described for Impact 3.13-6 (Alt. 1), Alternative 3 would continue to provide dispersed
recreation opportunities and access relative to existing conditions. The extent of the alternative’s recreation
infrastructure and public access elements would be less than under Alternative 1 but greater than under
Alternative 2. Similar to Alternative 1, recreation opportunities would move toward the developed end of the
spectrum, but not to the extent of a fully developed site (e.g., a marina or campground). Land-based recreation
opportunities would not be precluded after project implementation. However, the ability for nonmotorized
watercraft to travel into and through the study area would change because of the new distributary channel design.
The intent and purpose of Alternative 3 are to take the flows of the Upper Truckee River and spread them over the
entire study area. The dispersed flows would change the timing in which boats could access the study area. It is
possible that this change would reduce the amount of time the study area could be accessed compared to existing
conditions. Although the timing for boat access to the study area would change, boating would not be precluded.
Furthermore, there are abundant nonmotorized boating opportunities within the Tahoe Basin and along the Upper
Truckee River. This impact would be less than significant.

3.13-7
(Alt. 3)

Conflicts with Regional PAOT Allocations. (TRPA 1) Implementation of Alternative 3 would include
designated trails, bicycle paths, boardwalks, viewpoints, observation areas, and a fishing platform. As shown
in Section 3.10, “Land Use,” Table 3.10-9, summer day uses associated with Alternative 3 would require
PAOT allocations. Because plan areas associated with the study area do not have available PAOTs, they
would need to be obtained from the regional pool. Because Alternative 3 is an EIP and uses would be
consistent with the Regional Plan and Code of Ordinances, PAOTs could be allocated from the regional pool.
This impact would be less than significant.

Implementation of Alternative 3 would include designated trails, bicycle paths, boardwalks, viewpoints,

ALTERNATIVE 4: INSET FLOODPLAIN (MODERATE RECREATION INFRASTRUCTURE)
IMPACT
3.13-1
(Alt. 4)

Short-Term Increase in Use of Surrounding Neighborhood and Regional Parks and Recreation Facilities
during Construction. (CEQA 1) Construction activities associated with Alternative 4 would require portions of
the study area to be closed temporarily at various times during the 4-year-long construction period. As described
in Environmental Commitment 13, the Conservancy would prepare a Public Outreach Plan. The plan would
identify strategies to inform the general public and partnering agencies of access restrictions and their
anticipated timelines, alternate locations for passive recreation activities, and site access information. Recreation
activities in portions of the study area would be temporarily disrupted as a result of construction. However, all of
those recreation activities could be accommodated on the surrounding beaches, parks, and public open spaces
without causing or accelerating any substantial physical deterioration of the existing facilities because uses
would be dispersed throughout various locations. Because the Conservancy would provide outreach and
recreation access information for the study area and because alternate locations for dispersed recreation could
support existing study area recreationists during construction, this impact would be less than significant.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.13-1 for Alternatives 1–3, but less than Impact 3.13-1 (Alt. 1), greater than
Impact 3.13-1 (Alt. 2), and comparable to Impact 3.13-1 (Alt. 3) above. The types of construction activities and
duration of construction would be similar to Alternatives 1–3. Less acreage would be disturbed along the Upper
Truckee River than under Alternatives 1–3, but construction activities in the eastern portion of the study area
would be greater than under Alternative 2. As described in EC 13 (Table 2-6), the Conservancy would prepare a
Public Outreach Plan. The plan would identify strategies to inform the general public and partnering agencies of
access restrictions and their anticipated timelines, alternate locations for passive recreation activities, and site
access information. Because the Conservancy would provide outreach and recreation access information for the
study area and because alternate locations for dispersed recreation could support existing study area recreationists
during construction, this impact would be less than significant.

(Alt. 4)

Short-Term Construction Impacts of Recreation Facilities That May Have an Adverse Physical Effect
on the Environment. (CEQA 2) The short-term impacts of constructing the project’s recreation facilities are
analyzed in the various resource sections of this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS. Alternative 4 has short-term construction
impacts on wildlife and water quality, as discussed in Section 3.4, “Biological Resources: Vegetation and
Wildlife” and Section 3.9, “Geomorphology and Water Quality.” Therefore, the physical effect of constructing
recreation facilities under Alternative 4 would be potentially significant..

This impact is similar to but less than Impact 3.13-2 (Alt. 1) above. Alternative 4 is a moderate recreation
infrastructure alternative and has fewer recreation facilities than Alternative 1 (maximum recreation), more than

Alternative 2 and approximately the same as Alternative 3.The short-term impacts of constructing the project’s
recreation facilities are analyzed in the various resource sections of this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS. Alternative 4 has
short-term construction significant and unavoidable impacts on wildlife and water quality, as discussed in Section
3.4, “Biological Resources: Vegetation and Wildlife” and Section 3.9, “Geomorphology and Water Quality.”
Environmental Commitments (Table 2-6) and mitigation measures have been established to lessen these impacts
to the extent feasible. These impacts would be potentially significant.
Beyond Environmental Commitments described in Table 2-6, the following mitigation measures for the relevant
impacts would be implemented:
Mitigation Measure 3.4-8A (Alt. 4): Conduct Preconstruction Surveys for Nesting Special-Status Birds (Yellow
Warbler, Willow Flycatcher, Waterfowl, and Long-Eared Owl), and Implement Buffers If Necessary.
Described in Section 3.4
Mitigation Measure 3.4-8B (Alt. 4): Conduct Preconstruction Surveys for Special-Status Bats, Avoid Removal of
Important Roosts, and Implement a Limited Operating Period If Necessary.
Described in Section 3.4.
Significance after Mitigation: With implementation of the measures described above the short term construction impacts of
recreation facilities on the environment would be minimized, however, all impacts could not be fully mitigated, therefore the
impact would be significant and unavoidable.
IMPACT
3.13-3
(Alt. 4)

Short-Term Decrease or Loss of Public Access and Recreation Opportunities within Lakes,
Waterways, or Public Land during Construction. (CEQA 3; TRPA 2, 3) Closure of portions of the study
area during construction would have a short-term effect on recreation opportunities and access to the Upper
Truckee River and marsh within the study area. However, alternate opportunities for dispersed recreation are
abundant in the project vicinity and elsewhere in the Tahoe Basin. Many opportunities are located near the
marsh, such as at Regan Beach, El Dorado Recreation Area, and other public lands. The east channel of the
Tahoe Keys Marina would not be affected by Alternative 4. As described in Environmental Commitments 13
and 14, the Conservancy would prepare a Public Outreach Plan and Waterway Traffic Control Plan to
address boater and other recreation access conflicts. Because the Conservancy would provide outreach and
recreation access information for the study area and because alternate locations for dispersed recreation
could support existing study area recreationists during construction, this impact would be less than
significant.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.13-3 for Alternatives 1–3, but less than Impact 3.13-3 (Alt. 1), greater than
Impact 3.13-3 (Alt. 2), and comparable to Impact 3.13-3 (Alt. 3) above. Under all of the action alternatives,
construction activities would be similar in type and duration, and construction would occur at Cove East Beach
and be extensive along the Upper Truckee River. However, the extent of construction activities in other locations
would differ among alternatives. Unlike Alternative 1, Alternative 4 would not include the bridges, boardwalks,
or trails at the Lake Tahoe shoreline and would not include modifications to the Sailing Lagoon. Thus,
construction activities would not disturb these areas. Construction activities would be more widely distributed
than under Alternative 2 and thus would have a greater effect on recreation. For the same reasons as described for
Alternative 1, this impact would be less than significant.

IMPACT
3.13-4
(Alt. 4)

Long-Term Change in Use of Surrounding Neighborhood and Regional Parks and Recreation
Facilities. (CEQA 1) Implementation of Alternative 4 is not expected to increase the use of existing parks or
other recreation facilities enough to either result in substantial physical deterioration of the facility or
accelerate such deterioration. Once the facilities are constructed under this alternative, there would likely be
an increase in the number of visitors to the study area because Alternative 4 would provide additional
recreation-related infrastructure. This increase would primarily result from a small redistribution of recreational
use from existing facilities to the study area, and thus, an increased use of existing facilities outside of the
study area is not a likely outcome. Furthermore, Alternative 4 would provide sufficient facilities for the
anticipated volume of visitors to prevent physical deterioration of surrounding facilities. This impact would be
less than significant.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.13-4 (Alts. 1–3) above. Unlike Alternatives 1–3, however, Alternative 4 does
not include modifications to the Sailing Lagoon and thus would have no effect on the east channel of the Tahoe
Keys Marina. For the same reasons described above, this impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.13-5
(Alt. 4)

Long-Term Operation and Expansion of Recreation Facilities That May Have an Adverse Physical
Effect on the Environment. (CEQA 2) The recreation facilities associated with Alternative 4 are not expected
to result in long-term adverse physical effects on the environment. The recreation facilities associated with
Alternative 4 are designed to preserve the natural resources in the study area while providing recreational
opportunities, and public access and recreation infrastructure would reduce adverse physical effects on the
environment by redirecting use from sensitive to less sensitive areas. This effect would be less than
significant.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.13-5 (Alts. 2–3), but less than under Alternative 2 or 3 because the impact is
related to the amount of public access and recreation infrastructure. For the same reasons as described for
Alternatives 2 and 3, this effect would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.13-6
(Alt. 4)

Long-Term Decrease or Loss of Public Access and Recreation Opportunities within Lakes,
Waterways, or Public Lands. (CEQA 3; TRPA 2, 3) Under Alternative 4, some user-created trails would be
decommissioned to redirect visitors out of the core habitat area. However, dispersed recreation opportunities
would continue elsewhere within the study area in the long term. Furthermore, some dispersed recreation
opportunities and experiences would result from provision of designated facilities and recreation-related
infrastructure, and some opportunities would be more developed, although not to the extent of a fully
developed site (e.g., marina or campground). This impact would be less than significant.

For the same reasons as described for Impact 3.13-6 (Alts. 1–2), Alternative 4 would continue to provide
dispersed recreation opportunities and would improve public access relative to existing conditions. The extent of
the alternative’s recreation and public access infrastructure would be less than under Alternative 1, greater than
under Alternative 2, and similar to but less than under Alternative 1. Recreation opportunities would be more
developed, but not to the extent of a fully developed site (e.g., a marina or campground). This impact would be
less than significant.
IMPACT

designated trails, bicycle paths, boardwalks, viewpoints, observation areas, and a fishing platform. As shown
in Section 3.10, “Land Use,” Table 3.10-8, summer day uses associated with Alternative 4 would require
PAOT allocations. Because plan areas associated with the study area do not have available PAOTs, they
would need to be obtained from the regional pool. Because Alternative 4 is an EIP and uses would be
consistent with the Regional Plan and Code of Ordinances, PAOTs could be allocated from the regional pool.

facilities. No impact would occur.

Under Alternative 5, the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, no new facilities would be constructed and no
existing facilities would be altered, expanded, or demolished in the study area. Therefore, Alternative 5 would not

3.14 SCENIC RESOURCES
This section describes the visual setting and scenic resources of the study area, identifies impacts on scenic
quality that would result from Alternatives 1–5, and recommends mitigation measures intended to preserve scenic
quality. A small portion of the study area is visible from U.S. 50 (Roadway Travel Unit 35), which is designated
as a state scenic highway. The study area is also visible from Lake Tahoe. Therefore, a TRPA scenic analysis
involving views related to the lake is required for the proposed project. Consistency with TRPA goals and policies
is presented in Section 3.10, “Land Use,” Table 3.10-1. Cumulative scenic impacts are addressed in Section 3.18,
“Cumulative Impacts.” The project’s effects on thresholds are described in Section 4.5, “Consequences for
Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities.”

3.14.1

AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

REGULATORY SETTING
Federal
No federal plans, policies, or regulations apply to scenic resources within the study area.
State
The following state program related to scenic resources is relevant to the proposed alternatives and is described in
detail in Chapter 5, “Compliance, Consultation, and Coordination”:
►

California Scenic Highway Program

Tahoe Regional Planning Agency
Goals and Policies
The Goals and Policies document of the 1987 Regional Plan establishes an overall framework for development
and environmental conservation in the Lake Tahoe region. Chapter IV (Conservation Element) of the Goals and
Policies document considers ten subelements, including the Scenic subelement. The Scenic subelement states:
Scenic quality is perhaps the most often identified natural resource of the Lake Tahoe Basin. The
Basin affords views of a magnificent lake setting within a forested mountainous environment.
The unique combination of visual elements provides for exceptionally high aesthetic values. The
maintenance of the Basin’s scenic quality largely depends on careful regulation of the type,
location, and intensity of land uses.
The Scenic subelement contains a goal to maintain and restore the scenic qualities of the natural landscape of the
Basin. It also contains policies that require all development to examine impacts on landscape views (i.e.,
roadways, bikeways, public recreation areas, Lake Tahoe), require development in areas identified for scenic
restoration shall demonstrate effects on the 1982 travel route ratings, and consideration of factors or conditions
that contribute to scenic degradation.
Code of Ordinances
The applicable provisions of the TRPA Code of Ordinances regarding scenic standards are summarized below.

Design Standards
Chapter 36 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances contains design standards, including standards for scenic quality.
The TRPA Design Review Guidelines summarize the code requirements and guidelines and provide suggestions
for attaining the standards (TRPA 1989b:30-5–30-6). The following standards in the Design Review Guidelines
are particularly relevant:
►

(2) Lighting Levels. Avoid consistent overall lighting and overly bright lighting. The location of lighting
should respond to the anticipated use and should not exceed the amount of light actually required by users.
Lighting for pedestrian movement should illuminate entrances, changes in grade, path intersections, and other
areas along paths which, if left unlit, would cause the user to feel insecure. As a general rule of thumb, one
foot candle per square foot over the entire project area is adequate.

►

(5) Lighting Height. As a rule, the light source should be kept as low to the ground as possible while
ensuring safe and functional levels of illumination. Area lighting should be directed downward with no splay
of lighting directed offsite. The height of light fixtures or standards must meet the height limitations in
Chapter 37 [of the TRPA Code of Ordinances]. Direct light downward in order to avoid sky lighting. Any
light source over 10 feet high should incorporate a cut-off shield to prevent the light source from being
directly visible from areas offsite. The height of luminaries should be in scale with the setting and generally
should not exceed 10–12 feet.

Scenic Standards
Section 66.1, “Scenic Quality Standards,” of the TRPA Code of Ordinances contains standards pertaining to
scenic quality. Section 66.1 establishes a process for analyzing projects for scenic quality and defines those
circumstances that require preparation of scenic assessments and/or other documents. It also requires a security
deposit equal to the cost of scenic mitigation measures for projects visible from nonattainment areas, and a fiveyear review for continued presence and maintenance (described in more detail below). Sections 66.1.3, 66.1.4,
and 66.1.5 describe scenic quality standards for roadway and shoreline units, and for public recreation areas and
bicycle trails. Relevant subsections from Section 66.1 are listed below.
►

Section 66.1 Scenic Quality Standards
•

Subsection 66.1.2 Applicability: All projects shall comply with the standards of this section.

•

Subsection 66.1.3 Roadway and Shoreline Unit Scenic Quality: The project shall not cause a decrease
in the numerical ratings assigned to roadway or shoreline units, including the scenic quality rating of the
individual resources within each unit, as recorded in the 1982 Scenic Resources Inventory and shown in
Tables 13-3, 13-5, 13-8, and 13-9 of the Study Report for the Establishment of Environmental Threshold
Carrying Capacities, October 1982. The criteria for rating scenic quality as identified in the study report
cited herein shall be used to determine if a project will cause a decrease in the numerical rating.

•

Subsection 66.3.2 Review Process: The applicant shall complete a scenic assessment when applying for
any activity requiring a TRPA permit. An applicant may apply for a scenic assessment at any time to
document the baseline condition. Review and mitigation of scenic impacts shall be based on subsection
66.3.3 below.
A. Scenic Assessment: A scenic assessment shall be required prior to submittal of a project application
for Levels 3, 4, 5, and 6 projects. The scenic assessment will establish a baseline scenic condition for
all following scenic impact analyses. The baseline shall be the existing condition at the time of the
first scenic assessment, unless the site is the subject of an existing TRPA approval, by litigation
settlement or otherwise, that contains a scenic analysis, in which case the approved scenic analysis

shall be the baseline. For purposes of this Section, unbuilt projects with an active permit shall be
considered as existing.
1. Description of existing scenic conditions in the project area including, but not limited to, structure
color and height, existing visible mass from the Lake, types and areas of materials of existing
structures, and identification of needed scenic BMPs;
2. Identification of existing vegetation types and their location, size, and height; and
3. Photographic inventory of the project area from 300 feet and one quarter mile offshore, with at
least one photo from center and perpendicular to the project area, and photos of onsite existing
conditions.
•

Subsection 66.3.3 Levels of Scenic Mitigation: There are six levels of mitigation provided in the Code
of Ordinances. The proposed project falls under Level 6. This level consists of all projects involving new
or existing structures in the shoreland that are visible from the Lake and that qualify as public health and
safety projects or Environmental Improvement Program projects. The mitigation requirements for this
level shall be established on a case-by-case basis. Projects whose primary purpose is implementation of
water quality or scenic BMPs that do not increase the lake front façade and show an improvement in the
contrast rating score are exempt from mitigation requirements.

Height Standards
Chapter 37 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances establishes height standards to ensure attractive and compatible
development as required under Goal #2, Policy 1.B. of the Community Design Subelement, Land Use Element of
the Goals and Policies. The relevant subsections from Chapter 37 are listed below.
►

Section 37.6 Height Standards for Structures Other than Buildings
•

37.6.1 Maximum Structure Height: Except as provided for in subsection 37.6.2, no structure, other than
a building, shall have a maximum height greater than 26 feet.

•

37.6.2 Additional Height for Certain Structures: The maximum height specified in subsection 37.6.1
may be increased for communication towers, antennas, utility poles, special features of public safety
facilities, ski lift towers, and other similar projects, excluding buildings and signs, up to the minimum
height necessary to feasibly implement such projects. Additional height may be approved under the
provisions of this subsection if TRPA makes findings 4 and 7 as set forth in Section 37.7.

Plan Area Statements
The study area is located within six separate PASs: 99 (Al Tahoe), 100 (Truckee Marsh), 102 (Tahoe Keys),
103 (Sierra Tract Commercial), 104 (Highland Woods), and 111(Tahoe Island). Approximately 90 percent of the
study area lies within PASs 100 and 102, including the portion of the study area within Shoreline Travel Unit 33
(PAS 100 and PAS 102) and Roadway Travel Unit 35 (PAS 100).
One special policy includes a reference to scenic quality. Special Policy 11 in PAS 100 (TRPA 1986) states:
11. No new uses should be approved that would degrade the high scenic quality of Shoreline Unit No. 33 or
contribute to the further degradation of Roadway Unit No. 35.

Scenic Quality Improvement Program/Environmental Improvement Program
The SQIP was adopted to provide a program for implementing physical improvements to the built environment in
the Tahoe Basin (TRPA 1989a:1). The SQIP is intended to contribute to the attainment of the scenic resources
thresholds in the TRPA Goals and Policies (see above) and serves as an implementation guide for the Regional
Plan. The SQIP is an overall action plan to specifically improve the scenic quality of 23 roadway and four
shoreline travel routes that do not meet the scenic resources thresholds (TRPA 1989a:1).
The SQIP (TRPA 1989a:26) states:
As a general rule, individual projects can be considered not to be contributing to threshold
degradation when the project’s individual design elements conform to or exceed adopted design
standards, or the guidelines set forth in the Design Review Guidelines.
Design standards and design review guidelines are listed under the “Scenic Standards” and “Design Review
Guidelines/Contrast Rating System” subsections, respectively, above.
The Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) adopted in 1998 incorporates elements of the SQIP. The EIP
includes a list of specific projects throughout the basin that are needed to attain and maintain the thresholds
(TRPA 1997). Although the study area does not contain any EIP-listed projects under scenic resources, EIP
Project #99, which called for scenic improvements (e.g., building upgrades, visual screening) along a portion of
Roadway Unit #35, runs through the southern tip of the study area.
City of South Lake Tahoe
The City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan (CSLT 1999) does not contain a section specific to scenic resources;
however, the goals, objectives, and actions listed below, related to scenic resources and located within the
Conservation, Open Space, and Land Use Elements, are relevant to the project.
Conservation
►

Goal 1: Conserve and enhance the scenic and other natural resources within the boundaries of the City [of
South Lake Tahoe].

Open Space
The following actions are associated with Goal 1, Objective 1:
–

Action 2: In conjunction with the Land Use Action Plan to create a Scenic Plan for the edges of
the City, those portions of A1 Tahoe Boulevard (outside of the Bijou/Al Tahoe Community Plan)
and Pioneer Trail (southwest from the intersection of A1 Tahoe Boulevard to El Dorado County
and northeast to approximately Ralph Drive) include in the PAS a minimum of 500 foot setback
of the natural forest edge to maintain the rural scenic experience viewed from the roadways. No
buildings or structures or signage shall be visible from these roadways.

–

Action 3: Enhance the scenic quality of the meadow and SEZ [Stream Environment Zone] area
(northwest of the A1 Tahoe/Pioneer Trail intersection) by opening it for view through the
elimination of (or partial elimination by creating vistas through) the evergreen screen adjacent to
the roadways.

Action 1: Implement the TRPA Scenic Quality Improvement Plan.

–

Action 2: Implement the City Design and the Community Plan Design Standards.

–

Action 4: Continue the long range public utility underground program in close coordination with
the utility companies.

–

Action 5: Continue to maintain and enhance that portion of Highway 50/89 designated as a
scenic corridor and further evaluate the designation of the remainder.

–

Action 6: Develop a Scenic Plan to enhance the entry ways into the urban portions of the city, to
include U.S. 50/89, Lake Tahoe Boulevard (from El Dorado County), A1 Tahoe Boulevard (from
Pioneer Trail) and Martin Avenue (from El Dorado County). This plan would include those areas
within and outside of community plans and would include such improvements as native
landscaping, fences, walks and other improvements to establish a “sense of community” for the
City. This scenic plan may include the establishment of incentives to relocate incompatible land
uses into PAS more appropriately suited for the use, For example, the relocation of the cement
batch plant and contractors storage yard on U.S. 50 into the Wye industrial area.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Scenic Character of the Study Area
The study area is largely undeveloped and its scenic character is defined primarily by its adjacency to the lake,
presence of the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek in the landscape, and existing habitat features (willow scrub–
wet meadow, montane meadow, and lodgepole pine forest). The river and creek provide perennial water features
visible in the landscape, adding interest, variety, and vividness. Habitat areas include views of open wet meadow
intermixed with low-lying shrubs over much of the middle of the study area and stands of large lodgepole and
Jeffrey pines in the southeast and western portions of the study area. There are also areas of open water with aquatic
vegetation in the middle of the study area, varying in extent depending on lake level and river flows.
The northern portion of the study area is characterized by sandy beach and views of the mouth of the Upper Truckee
River draining into the lake. The western portion of the study area contains the Lower West Side Wetland
Restoration Area and the Tahoe Keys Property Owners Association (TKPOA) Corporation Yard. The reaches of the
Upper Truckee River that run through the study area are characterized by open water with eroding banks and some
low-lying vegetation along the edges of the river. The study area also contains volunteer native surface trails that
cross various portions of the property, existing corral structures are located in the middle, and fences that are visible
from the edges of the study area. There are no sources of light and glare within the study area.
Views of the study area from the community are provided primarily at the ends of public, mostly residential streets
that abut the property. The public visual access with the highest number of viewers is from the end of East Venice
Drive near the trailhead into the Lower West Side Wetland Restoration Project. The area is also viewed by boaters
from the lake in Shoreline Travel Unit 33. Only a very small portion of the study area along a short reach of the
Upper Truckee River is visible from U.S. 50 (Roadway Travel Unit 35), looking north where it crosses the river.

The study area is in a unique location that provides views that are rarely all visible from one location within the
Tahoe Basin. The study area provides 360-degree views of the Tahoe Basin with the closest mountain views to
the south and west; direct views of Lake Tahoe to the north, including views of public beaches; and views of the
Upper Truckee River corridor, Trout Creek, and open marsh from within the study area. The number and variety
of scenic views provided by the study area contribute to the high visual quality of the area (Exhibit 3.14-1).
Visual Character of the Surrounding Environment
A map showing representative existing viewpoints with views of the study area is shown in Exhibit 3.14-1.
Photographs from these viewpoints are shown in Exhibits 3.14-2 through 3.14-7 and are described below. These
photographs are a representative subset of the viewpoints that provide views of the study area. For a complete
index of viewpoints and associated photographs, see Appendix K.
North of the Study Area
Lake Tahoe is adjacent to and immediately north of the study area. Small craft can land at the study area, so
boaters can gain close-up views of the beach and mouth of the Upper Truckee River. Views of the mouth of the
Upper Truckee River from the lake are framed by four tall pine trees to the right and primarily meadow
throughout the area, with a series of mountains framing background views (Exhibit 3.14-2). The picturesque
waters of Lake Tahoe and the surrounding mountainsides north of the study area have a high visual quality. In
fact, Shoreline Travel Unit 33 is the highest rated shoreline unit around the lake (at 14 of 15 points) because of the
intactness and variety of the natural background view and the relative lack of visible structures as seen from the
lake.
West of the Study Area
The Tahoe Keys Marina, Tahoe Keys subdivision, and Tahoe Island subdivision are west of the study area. These
residential areas provide viewers who can look over the river and wetland from multiple private viewpoints along
the western boundary of the study area. Views to the west are of approximately 200 single-family residences amid
existing pine trees. Views from the west include low-lying marsh vegetation and distant views of forest and
mountains.
Condominiums that border Lake Tahoe to the north and the outlet to the Tahoe Keys Marina to the east have
elevated views of the study area. Views are broad and open across part of the study area with relatively sparse
vegetation. Views of the study area are available from the parking area and many viewpoints within the marina.
Approximately 470 feet west of the East Venice Drive cul-de-sac, which is along the western border of the study
area, three or four condominiums have distant views of the west side of the study area (Exhibit 3.14-3). The
TKPOA Corporation Yard and the Tahoe Island subdivision have views of the Upper Truckee River and distant
views of the open marsh and forest (Exhibit 3.14-4).
South of the Study Area
Views to the south include the northernmost row of several hundred single-family residences mixed among
existing evergreen trees. While U.S. 50 is located southeast of the subdivision, it is only visible from a short reach
of the river just north of the highway and is screened from view from the rest of the study area (Exhibit 3.14-5).
Most of the river and nearly all of the study area as a whole are not visible to passing motorists on U.S. 50.

Scenic Ratings of the Study Area and Vicinity
Roadway Travel Unit Ratings
Roadway Travel Unit 35 includes the approximately 2.8-mile-long view corridor along U.S. 50 that extends less
than 0.5 mile south of the U.S. 50/SR 89 intersection southwest of the study area, to less than 0.5 mile from the
shores of Lake Tahoe east of the study area and the Al Tahoe subdivision. Views of the study area are available
for approximately 0.6 mile of Roadway Travel Unit 35. This unit has a rating of 8 and is not currently in threshold
attainment according to TRPA’s 2006 Threshold Evaluation Report (TRPA 2007). Restoration is recommended
for roadway travel units rated at 15 or below. Table 3.14-1 shows the roadway travel unit ratings and the threshold

Shoreline Unit Ratings
TRPA’s Shoreline Unit 33, Truckee Marsh, extends approximately 1.35 miles from the east channel entrance to
the Tahoe Keys Resort just west of the study area to the shoreline on the eastern border of the study area. Views
of this unit from Lake Tahoe include Freel and Job’s Peaks in the background, with some lower ridges and bare
summits along the panorama view. The view of the shoreline from the lake is distinctive in its variety of
vegetation, such as willows in riparian corridors, wetland and meadow in the middle ground, and pine forest on
the flanks and in the background. Very little development is visible in this shoreline unit. The scenic quality
Upper Truckee Marsh has been degraded slightly by views of utility poles. This unit has a rating of 14 out of a
possible 15 and is currently in threshold attainment according to the 2006 Threshold Evaluation Report (TRPA
2007). This unit has the highest rating of any shoreline unit around the lake and has sustained this high rating
since the initial evaluation in 1982. Restoration is recommended for shoreline units rated at 7 or below. Table
3.14-2 shows the shoreline unit ratings and the threshold criteria for Shoreline Unit 33.

Mapped Scenic Resources
Mapped scenic resources include Shoreline View 33-1 (view of low shore with distinctive vegetation) and
Shoreline Visual Feature 33-2 (cluster of willows and pines that mark the river mouth). Both of these features
have a scenic quality rating of 3, which is considered high scenic quality. Unique visual features of this shoreline
unit include the river mouth and clusters of willows and pines marking its location. Additionally, a small portion
of the project would be visible within Roadway Visual Feature 35-2 (Truckee River stream zone) and 35-4 (Front
Creek stream zone). Both have a scenic rating of 2, which is considered moderate scenic quality.
Public Recreation Areas
TRPA’s 1993 Lake Tahoe Scenic Resource Evaluation did not identify any TRPA-designated public recreation
areas with direct views of the study area (TRPA 1993).

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES AND MITIGATION MEASURES

SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA
For this analysis, significance criteria are based on the checklist presented in Appendix G of the State CEQA
Guidelines; the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist; factual or scientific information and data; and regulatory
standards of Federal, State, and local agencies. These criteria also encompass the factors taken into account under
NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and intensity of its effects.
CEQA Criteria
Under CEQA, an alternative was determined to result in a significant effect related to scenic resources if it would:
►

►

►

have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista (CEQA-1);
substantially damage scenic resources, including but not limited to scenic waterways, trees, rock
outcroppings, and historic buildings in a state scenic highway (CEQA-2);
substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of the site and its surroundings (CEQA-3); or

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Scenic Resources

3.14-12

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

►

create a new source of substantial light or glare that would adversely affect day or nighttime views in the area
(CEQA-4).

NEPA Criteria
An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the
environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the proposed action. Under NEPA, the significance
of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account
under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are
encompassed by the CEQA criteria used for this analysis.
TRPA Criteria
Based on TRPA’s Initial Environmental Checklist, an alternative was determined to result in a significant effect
related to scenic resources if it would:
►
►

reduce scenic quality from mapped resources (TRPA-1); or
reduce threshold ratings from roadway or shoreline units (TRPA-2).

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
The scenic quality of an area is determined through the variety and contrasts of the area’s visual features, the
character of those features, and the scope and scale of the scene. This analysis uses a qualitative descriptive
method to characterize and evaluate the visual resources of the areas that could be affected by the project using
the criteria listed above. Project features were considered to have a substantial effect on visual resources if they
would be visually prominent, threaten the attainment of a TRPA threshold, or be incompatible with the natural
landscape. The impact analysis is based on a qualitative evaluation of consistency with the CEQA and TRPA
criteria above, and a quantitative analysis for views from the lake.

EFFECTS NOT DISCUSSED FURTHER IN THIS EIR/EIS/EIS
Effects related to all significance criteria listed above are discussed further in the EIR/EIS/EIS.

IMPACT ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
Alternative 1: Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
IMPACT
3.14-1
(Alt. 1)

Potential for Short-Term Degradation of the Scenic Quality of Shoreline Travel Unit 33, Roadway Travel
Unit 35, or the Visual Character or Quality of the Study Area. (CEQA 1, 2, 3, TRPA 2) The study area is
within Shoreline Travel Unit 33 and Roadway Travel Unit 35. Alternative 1 would include construction of
restoration and recreation infrastructure that includes staging of construction equipment and materials (e.g.,
rock, vegetation, backhoes) that could be visible from these areas over a period of approximately four years.
Construction activities could degrade the scenic quality of the shoreline travel unit, roadway travel unit, and
within the study area; however, construction activities would be temporary and would not result in substantial
changes. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

During construction, heavy equipment and associated vehicles, construction workers, staging areas, and
construction activities would be visible or partially visible from surrounding areas, primarily the southeast and
northwest portions of the study area. Construction activities associated with placement of bank protection along
the Upper Truckee River and construction of the kiosk would occur near U.S. 50.

The most extensive construction (excavation, grading, and hauling) would be performed along the Upper Truckee
River near the west side of the study area. Most views of the construction by residents would generally be from
several hundred feet away; for other viewers, such as employees of a boat-wrapping business who would have the
most direct line of sight, the view would be across three rows of vehicle parking. Residents and recreationists near
the storage/staging areas shown in Exhibit 2-5 in Chapter 2, “Project Alternatives,” would also experience shortterm changes to their views.
Although there would be changes in views associated with construction, these changes would be temporary and
would not substantially degrade the visual character of the study area or reduce the threshold ratings from any
shoreline or travel units. This impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.14-2
(Alt. 1)

Potential for Long-Term Degradation of the Scenic Quality of Shoreline Travel Unit 33 and Mapped
Scenic Resources Related to the Boardwalk and Observation Platforms. (CEQA 1, 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2) The
study area is within Shoreline Travel Unit 33, a unit with a high scenic rating, including Shoreline View 33-1 and
Shoreline Visual Feature 33-2. A boardwalk and two observation platforms would be placed behind the beach
(as viewed from Lake Tahoe) under Alternative 1, but would be sufficiently low-lying that they would not be
visible from the lake because of screening by the beach ridge and vegetation. Therefore, these features would
not substantially degrade or reduce the threshold rating for Shoreline Travel Unit 33 or the mapped scenic
resources. This impact would be less than significant.

An observation platform is proposed for the northeast portion of the study area near East Barton Beach, and a
second observation platform is also proposed west of the Upper Truckee River. A boardwalk would be
constructed just south of the barrier beach. It would connect paths on the east side of the study area’s marsh next
to Al Tahoe with the existing trail on the west side of the marsh behind Cove East Beach (next to Tahoe Keys
Marina). Under Alternative 1, the proposed observation platforms would introduce a 25-foot-long by 25-footwide deck with a wood and cable railing. The boardwalk would be elevated approximately two feet above existing
grade and would be 12 feet wide with a three-foot-tall railing on the lake side. The boardwalk would be
constructed of powder-coated metal or wood. As seen from the lake, the decks of the boardwalk and the
observation platforms would be placed at an elevation that would be obscured behind the beach ridge, existing
vegetation, and trees.
Nearby views currently encompass the undisturbed marsh, but also an existing pier extending out from the west
edge of the condominium complex. Although the horizontal lines of the railing along the expanse of the shoreline
would introduce a human-made feature to what is otherwise a natural view from Lake Tahoe, the wood-and-cable
railing would be screened by vegetation or largely transparent, especially at the distance boaters are likely to view
the shoreline (i.e., 300 feet, as required by TRPA scenic quality evaluation standards). The rails of the low-lying
boardwalk and observation platforms would be very narrow features, using natural colors to blend into the
background. The railings would be barely visible within the landscape, as seen from the lake and they would not
introduce significantly contrasting elements to these views. Consequently, a visual contrast rating of the
boardwalk and observation platforms is not necessary. Alternative 1 would not substantially degrade the visual
quality of or reduce the threshold rating from Shoreline Travel Unit 33 or the mapped scenic resources within this
travel unit. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

IMPACT
3.14-3
(Alt. 1)

Potential for Long-Term Degradation of the Scenic Quality of Shoreline Travel Unit 33 and Mapped
Scenic Resources Related to the Upper Truckee River Bridge and Ramps. (CEQA 1, 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2)
A bridge would be constructed over the Upper Truckee River approximately ten feet above the river as part of
the pedestrian/bicycle path provided across the marsh. Ramps would connect the elevated bridge to the lowlying boardwalk. Both the bridge and ramps would be elevated sufficiently to be prominently visible from the
lake. While color choices and vegetative screening would reduce visibility of the bridge and ramps, the
additional structural façade in views from the lake would degrade the scenic quality of the shoreline travel unit.
This impact would be significant.

The boardwalk path across the Upper Truckee Marsh proposed in Alternative 1 would include a bridge crossing
of the Upper Truckee River. The proposed bridge would be approximately ten feet above the water line to allow
room for paddling access to the river mouth beneath it. It would extend 225 feet across the river. To connect to the
low-lying boardwalk, the bridge would include 62.5-foot-long ramps on either end. These project features are not
expected to degrade views of mapped scenic resources and 33-1 and 33-2 because these features would not
obstruct views of the pine trees at the mouth of the river or vegetation along the shoreline. Boaters would
experience changes in views of the Upper Truckee Marsh with the addition of visible structure from the elevated,
225-foot span of pedestrian/bicycle bridge. Boaters would see the platform, support columns, and railings of the
elevated bridge and ramps high enough above the existing shoreline vegetation to be prominent. Views of the
proposed bridge and ramps from west of the mouth of the Upper Truckee River would be blocked by four tall
pine trees and thick willow scrub, but the bridge and ramps to the bridge would be clearly visible from directly off
shore in the lake.
As shown in Exhibit 3.14-2, boaters would have clear views of the proposed bridge from the lake (this view is
300 feet away, as required by TRPA scenic quality evaluation standards). Thus, a contrast rating and visual
magnitude assessment has been prepared in accordance with Chapter 36 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances. A
summary of the assessment results is described below.
TRPA Contrast Rating Analysis of the Bridge and Ramps
The following contrast rating analysis with the four primary parts (color score, glass score, perimeter score, and
surface/texture score) was used to evaluate these project elements within the Lake Tahoe shoreline.
Color Score
The optimal color for the highest TRPA color score would typically be dark brown for a color score of 17.
However, a color analysis for the bridge and ramps indicate the optimal bridge color appears to be more bluish
gray with grayish tan support columns.
For the purposes of this analysis, bluish grey is considered equivalent to the optimal color score for the bridge and
ramps because of its ability to blend in with the background. The grayish tan support columns would receive a
score of 11, and the bridge and ramps would receive a 17. Assuming two façade planes for the bridge and ramps
and support columns, these color values produce a color score of 16.7 out of a possible 17.
Glass Score
Because no glass is proposed for along the shoreline, this value does not apply.
Surface Plane and Texture Score
The surface plane and texture score is calculated by determining the number of visible planes and the texture of
each of those planes. Two planes are assumed for the bridge and ramps and support columns and these features

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

3.14-15

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Scenic Resources

would be constructed of metal, wood, and concrete, which would be considered a heavy texture. According to the
Surface Plane and Texture matrix, features with two planes and heavy texture, would receive a texture rating of 5.
Perimeter Score
The perimeter score is derived from the percentage of façade perimeter that is visible with screening vegetation.
The optimal score would be 10, where 0 to 10 percent of the perimeter would be visible. The total perimeter of the
façade of the bridge, ramps, and support columns would be 780 feet, where 540 feet (or 69 percent) of that
perimeter would be over water and could not be mitigated with screening vegetation. Based on the TRPA
perimeter matrix, structures that have between 61 and 70 percent perimeter visible, would yield a score of 4 for
the visible perimeter.
Composite Score
The composite score for the bridge, ramps, and support columns, which is calculated by summing the color and
reflectance score, surface plane and texture score, and perimeter score, assuming optimal vegetative screening,
would be 25. This score of 25 with vegetative screening on the ramps would not meet the normally required score
of 28. Therefore, because Alternative 1 would reduce the threshold rating of Shoreline Travel Unit 33 and degrade
the mapped scenic resources within this travel unit, this impact would be significant.
Mitigation: Because the composite score was calculated based on use of optimal colors and vegetative screening
for the bridge, ramps, and support columns, no additional mitigation is feasible to further reduce the visual impact
of these features.
Significance after Mitigation: Because no feasible mitigation exists, this impact would remain significant and
unavoidable. According to a special policy for PAS 100, no new uses should be approved that would degrade the
high scenic quality of Shoreline Unit No. 33. The proposed bridge would be in conflict with this policy.
IMPACT
3.14-4
(Alt. 1)

Potential for Long-Term Degradation of a Scenic Highway or the Scenic Quality of Roadway Travel Unit
35 and Mapped Scenic Resources. (CEQA 1, 2; TRPA 1, 2)The study area is within view from U.S. 50,
which is not designated as a state scenic highway but is within Roadway Travel Unit 35, including Roadway
Visual Features 35-2 and 35-4. The proposed kiosk in the southern portion of the study area is the only
permanent facility that would be located near U.S. 50. Views of this facility from U.S. 50 would be obscured by
other buildings and existing development. Because no scenic resources within a scenic highway would be
damaged substantially and the threshold rating for the roadway travel unit would not be reduced including the
mapped scenic resources, this impact would be less than significant.

The study area is within view from U.S. 50; however, this section of the highway is not designated as a State
scenic highway. U.S. 50 is also within Roadway Travel Unit 35, which is currently not in attainment. One of the
proposed kiosks would be located in the southwest portion of the study area near U.S. 50; however, views of this
kiosk would be obscured by existing buildings along U.S. 50. Because no scenic resources within a scenic
highway would be damaged and the threshold rating for Travel Unit 35 or the mapped scenic resources would not
be reduced, this impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.14-5
(Alt. 1)

Potential for Long-Term Degradation in Existing Visual Character or Quality of the Study Area.
(CEQA 3) Alternative 1 would include some elements that would be visible after construction. Nearby residents
and recreationists could experience changes in views related to these project elements. However, few
permanent facilities are proposed and the scenic quality of the study area would not be substantially degraded.
Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

Alternative 1 would include two kiosks, stabilization of the existing river access for boat take-out, observation
areas, boardwalks and pedestrian trails, and bicycle paths. Viewers that may have views of these project elements
would be recreationists, residents in surrounding neighborhoods, and travelers on U.S. 50.
One kiosk is proposed near an existing regional bike trail near U.S. 50, in the southeastern portion of the study
area and another is proposed adjacent to the parking lot near Tahoe Keys Marina. These features would introduce
views of small scale human-made structures roughly five feet long by 12 feet wide and tall enough to provide
protection for standing trail users. Natural materials and colors would also be used for the kiosks.
In addition to the kiosks, several residences and recreationists would have views of new bike paths that would be
constructed or existing trails that would be paved under Alternative 1. Constructing new paths or paving existing
native surface paths would introduce human-made features into the landscape; however, pedestrian trails and bike
paths would be small-scale and dispersed throughout the study area. The paths would also be largely be screened
by surrounding vegetation.
Views of the natural surroundings within the study area would also change to encompass a boardwalk elevated
approximately two feet above the ground, with a ten-foot-wide powder-coated metal or wood surface and a threefoot-tall railing on the lake side. The change in views of the existing well-delineated gravel trail to views of
pavement and a few hundred feet of new boardwalk would not be substantial because existing and future uses
would be similar and views would remain largely natural. Natural materials and colors would be used for the
boardwalk, and because it would be low-lying and small-scale, it would not become a dominant feature in the
views of the study area.
Riparian vegetation surrounding the Upper Truckee River would effectively block views of the proposed
observation platform from the west side of the study area and the platform would be constructed with natural
materials and colors. Thus, the proposed observation platform would not substantially affect scenic vistas for
viewers or substantially degrade the visual quality of the study area.
Introducing public access facilities and recreation infrastructure into approximately 633 acres of primarily natural
meadows and riparian vegetation would add human-made elements into the study area landscape. However,
because project elements would be small-scale, would use natural materials and colors, and the study area would
remain largely undeveloped and natural in character, these changes would not substantially degrade the visual
quality of the study area. This impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.14-6
(Alt. 1)

Potential for Increases in Light or Glare. (CEQA 4) The project would introduce heavy construction vehicles
and equipment that may create some glare over a period of approximately four years; however, construction
would not take place during months that would require lighting to be used. A parking area near the west side of
the study area would increase light and glare in the long term, but this increase in lighting would be minimal.
This impact would be less than significant.

The project would introduce heavy construction vehicles and equipment that may create some glare over a period
of approximately four years, primarily during daylight hours and, during the grading season (May 1 through
October 15). Even so, it is unlikely that construction would take place during months that would require lighting
to be used because of inclement weather. In addition, light and glare impacts related to construction would be
temporary and would not be substantial.
The parking area proposed for the west side of the study area would be the only permanent project element that
would have lighting. According to the CSLT’s exterior lighting standards, parking lot, walkway, and building
lights shall be directed downward and shall not exceed 26 feet in height. Because the new lighting would be near
an existing parking lot and lighting at the Tahoe Keys Marina to the immediate west, and because the proposed
lighting would be minimal and would be consistent with the CSLT’s lighting design criteria, the project would not
create substantial light and glare impacts in the long term. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

(Alt. 2)

Potential for Short-Term Degradation of the Scenic Quality of Shoreline Travel Unit 33, Roadway Travel

activities associated with Alternative 2 may be visible from viewpoints outside of the study area. Construction
restoration and recreation infrastructure that includes staging of construction equipment and materials (e.g.,
rock, vegetation, backhoes) that would temporarily change views, primarily of and from the southeast and
northwest portions of the study area, over a period of approximately four years. Construction activities could
degrade the scenic quality of the shoreline travel unit, roadway travel unit, and within the study area; however,
construction activities would be temporary and would not be substantial. This impact would be less than
significant.

This impact is similar to but less than Impact 3.14-1 (Alt. 1), which would be less than significant. Alternative 2
would not include kiosks, a bridge, boardwalk, or other public access/recreation facilities that are included under
Alternative 1; thus, this alternative would result in less construction activity than Alternative 1. In addition,
construction activities associated with Alternative 2 would be temporary and would not substantially degrade the
visual character of the study area or reduce the threshold ratings from any shoreline or travel units. Therefore, this
impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT

(Alt. 2)

Potential for Long-Term Degradation of the Scenic Quality of Shoreline Travel Unit 33 and Mapped
Scenic Resources Related to the Boardwalk and Observation Platforms. (CEQA 1, 2, 3; TRPA 1, 2)
Alternative 2 would not include the boardwalk or observation platforms that could be visible from this Shoreline
Travel Unit 33 or the associated mapped resources. Thus, Alternative 2 would not substantially degrade the
scenic quality or reduce the threshold rating of this shoreline travel unit or mapped scenic resources. No
impact would occur.

Because Alternative 2 would not include any facilities that would be visible from Lake Tahoe or Shoreline Travel
Unit 33, no TRPA contrast rating analysis was prepared for this alternative. Alternative 2 would not include
construction of facilities associated with the boardwalk or observation platforms that would be constructed as part
of Alternative 1. Therefore, Alternative 2 would not substantially degrade the visual quality of or reduce the
threshold rating from Shoreline Travel Unit 33 or the mapped scenic resources within this travel unit. No impact
would occur.

Alternative 2 would not include the bridge over the Upper Truckee River that is proposed under Alternative 1.
In addition, Alternative 2 would not include ramps to connect the elevated bridge to the low-lying boardwalk.
Because Alternative 2 would not include any facilities that would be visible from Lake Tahoe or Shoreline

(Alt. 2)

Potential for Long-Term Degradation of the Scenic Quality of a Scenic Highway or Roadway Travel Unit
35 and Mapped Scenic Resources. (CEQA 1, 2; TRPA 1, 2) Under Alternative 2, no permanent facilities
would be located near U.S. 50; however, placement of bank protection along the Upper Truckee River may be
visible from the highway. This would be a minor change in views; therefore, this impact would be less than
significant.

Placement of bank protection along the Upper Truckee River may be visible from U.S. 50; however, this would
be a minimal change in views for travelers on U.S. 50. In addition, Alternative 2 would not include construction
of the kiosk near U.S. 50 that is included under Alternative 1. No other facilities—temporary or permanent—
would be constructed within the viewshed of U.S. 50. Because no scenic resources of a scenic highway would be
damaged and the threshold rating for Travel Unit 35 and the mapped scenic resources within the travel unit would
not be reduced, this impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.14-5
(Alt. 2)

Potential for Long-Term Degradation in Existing Visual Character or Quality of the Study Area.
(CEQA 3) Alternative 2 would include some elements in the southeast and northwest portions of the study area
that would be visible after construction. Nearby residents and recreationists could experience changes in views
related to these facilities. However, very few permanent facilities are proposed and the scenic quality of the
study area would not be substantially degraded. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.14-5 (Alt. 1); however, fewer permanent facilities would be constructed under
Alternative 2 than under Alternative 1, resulting in fewer changes to the existing visual character of the study
area. Unlike Alternative 1, Alternative 2 would include a fishing platform within approximately 440 feet of a
residence in the Tahoe Keys Marina. The fishing platform would be made of wood and metal and would be
approximately 300 square feet. Because the proposed fishing platform would have a relatively low profile and
would be constructed with natural materials and colors, visual impacts related to the fishing platform would not
be substantial. Given that all other project elements in Alternative 2 are similar to those of Alternative 1 in their
attributes but are fewer in number, Alternative 2 would create fewer visual changes than Alternative 1. Therefore,
for this reason and the reasons given in the discussion of Impact 3.14-5 (Alt. 1), these features would not
substantially degrade the visual quality of the study area. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.14-6
(Alt. 2)

Potential for Increases in Light or Glare. (CEQA 4) Alternative 2 would introduce heavy construction

unlikely that construction would take place during months that would require lighting to be used, and this
alternative would not include long-term sources of light or glare. Therefore, this impact would be less than
significant.

This impact is similar to but less than Impact 3.14-6 (Alt. 1), which would be less than significant. Short-term
increases in light and glare under Alternative 2 would be the same as under Alternative 1. Alternative 2 would not
include long-term sources of light or glare. Because there would be no substantial increases in light or glare, this
impact would be less than significant.

Alternative 3 would include a boardwalk; however, it would be sufficiently low-lying that it would not be visible
from the lake because of screening by the beach ridge and vegetation. Therefore, this impact would be less
than significant.

This impact is similar to but less than Impact 3.14-2 (Alt. 1), which would be less than significant. Alternative 3
would include a boardwalk near Shoreline Travel Unit 33 similar to Alternative 1; however, the boardwalk would
be shorter (2,273 linear feet) than the boardwalk proposed under Alternative 1 (4,000 linear feet) and Alternative
3 would not include observation platforms near the shoreline. Alternative 3 would include a fishing platform
made of wood or composite material and metal that would be approximately 500 square feet. As described under
Impact 3.14-2 (Alt. 2), the visual changes associated with the fishing platform would not be substantial.

ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
This section describes the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the City of South Lake Tahoe and
El Dorado County. It analyzes the possibility of changes in population, housing, and employment that could result
from implementation of the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project, including those that could
trigger adverse physical effects in the city or the region. Also, this section addresses environmental justice issues
associated with the project’s implementation.

AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

REGULATORY SETTING
Federal
Socioeconomics
National Environmental Policy Act, Section 1502
Provisions in NEPA found in Section 1502.16(c) of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 1502.16[c]) require
federal agencies to identify potential conflicts between a proposed action and the related plans and policies of
federal, state, and local agencies and Indian tribes. This requirement helps federal agencies identify potential
conflicts that may cause adverse effects on the social and economic environment of a study area because many
agencies’ and tribes’ plans and policies are designed to protect the people residing within their jurisdictions and/or
the local economy they depend upon for their economic livelihoods (CEQ 2008).
Council on Environmental Quality
The Council on Environmental Quality’s (CEQ) Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of
NEPA (40 CFR 1500–1508) provide guidance related to social and economic impact assessments by noting that
the “human environment” assessed under NEPA is to be “interpreted comprehensively” to include “the natural
and physical environment and the relationship of people with that environment” (40 CFR 1508.14). Furthermore,
these regulations require agencies to assess “aesthetic, historic, cultural, economic, social, or health” effects,
whether direct, indirect, or cumulative (40 CFR 1508.8).
Environmental Justice
In 1994, President Bill Clinton issued Executive Order (EO) 12898 regarding environmental justice. This order
requires federal agencies to identify and address disproportionately high and adverse human health or
environmental effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income
populations in the United States. Two documents provide some measure of guidance to agencies required to
implement this executive order: Environmental Justice: Guidance under the National Environmental Policy Act
(CEQ 1997) and Final Guidance for Incorporating Environmental Justice Concerns in EPA’s NEPA Compliance
Analysis (EPA 1998). Both serve as guides for incorporating environmental justice goals into preparation of
environmental impact statements under NEPA. These documents provide specific guidelines for determining
whether there are any environmental justice issues associated with a proposed federal project.
State
The California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal/EPA) adopted an environmental justice policy in 2004
(Cal/EPA 2004). Pursuant to California Public Resources Code Sections 71110–71113, Cal/EPA developed this
policy to provide guidance to its resource boards, departments, and offices. The policy is intended to support the

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Population
Population Growth
The City of South Lake Tahoe experienced its most dramatic population growth between 1970 and 1980, when its
population grew from 12,921 to 20,681, or 4.82 percent per year. From 1990 to 2000, the population increased
from 21,586 to 23,609, or 0.94 percent per year (CSLT 2008a:3-2). The city’s year-round population reached a
peak in 2002, and declined slightly between 2002 and 2006. As of January 1, 2008, the California Department of
Finance (DOF) estimated that South Lake Tahoe’s population was approximately 23,725 (DOF 2008a).
Approximately 15 percent of El Dorado County’s population lives in South Lake Tahoe. The remaining
population of the county resides in the incorporated city of Placerville (10,237 or 6 percent of the county’s
population) and unincorporated areas, including El Dorado Hills, Cameron Park, Shingle Springs, Meyers, and
Pollock Pines (DOF 2008a).
El Dorado County has experienced a higher rate of population growth than South Lake Tahoe, primarily in the
western part of the county. Although the city’s population increased approximately 4.82 percent per year between
1970 and 1980, the county’s population increased approximately 6.95 percent per year during the same period
(CSLT 2008a:3-3). From 1990 to 2000, the population of El Dorado County increased from 125,955 to 156,299,
or an average annual growth rate of 2.18 percent per year (CSLT 2008a:3-3). As of January 2008, DOF estimated
that the county’s population was 179,722 (DOF 2008a).
Racial Composition and Poverty Status
Table 3.15-1 shows the racial composition of the populations of South Lake Tahoe and El Dorado County. The
city’s population is shown to be predominantly white, accounting for 85.7 percent of the population in 1990, and
75.7 percent in 2000. However, the city has a proportionally smaller white population than the county. El Dorado
County’s white population accounted for 94.5 percent of the total population in 1990, and 89.7 percent in 2000.
The white population increased in the county between 1990 and 2000, but South Lake Tahoe’s white population
decreased by 3.3 percent in the same period.

The U.S. Census Bureau considers Hispanic and Latino as an ethnicity, not a race. Consequently, a person of Hispanic or Latino
descent could identify racially as White, Black/African American, Native American, Asian, or other.

The Black/African American population in South Lake Tahoe decreased 20.2 percent between 1990 and 2000.
El Dorado County had a larger population of Black/African American residents than South Lake Tahoe, and its
Black/African American population increased by 34.2 percent during the same period.
For both the city and county, the American Indian/Alaskan Native population generally remained the same
between 1990 and 2000, comprising 1 percent of the total population in each location.
The Asian population in South Lake Tahoe increased by 3.8 percent between 1990 and 2000, accounting for
6 percent of the total population in 2000. In comparison, El Dorado County’s Asian population increased by
35. percent between 1990 and 2000.
South Lake Tahoe’s Hispanic/Latino population grew significantly between 1990 and 2000, increasing by 57.2
percent and accounting for more than a quarter of the city’s total population in 2000. Between 1990 and 2000,
E Dorado County also experienced significant growth in the number of its Hispanic/Latino residents, which
increased by 66 percent. (Please note that the U.S. Census considers Hispanic/Latino individuals to be an
ethnicity, rather than a race, so they are “double counted” in other racial categories.)

Table 3.15-2 shows the 1999 median household income, per capita income, and the percent of persons below
poverty level in South Lake Tahoe and El Dorado County. The city’s median household income and per capita
income were lower than those of the county. The city’s median income was $34,707 and its per capita income was
$18,452, compared to a median income of $51,484 and a per capita income of $25,560 for the county.
Approximately 12.5 percent of city residents were below poverty level, and 7.1 percent of county residents were
below poverty level. This difference can be accounted for, in part, because South Lake Tahoe had a relatively
high cost of living. In addition, people employed in the seasonal service industry and retail workforce generally
worked in lower-wage jobs as casino workers, ski instructors, and restaurant workers.

Housing
The number of housing units in South Lake Tahoe decreased from 14,066 in 1990, to 14,005 in 2000, a decrease
of less than 0.01 percent (CSLT 2008b:4-17). Although the housing statistics do not show a net increase in
housing units, the city has seen an increase in residential development in recent years. Some of this housing
development has occurred in places where existing units were demolished or rehabilitated, thus they are not
reflected in the net housing growth (CSLT 2008b:4-18). The number of housing units, as of January 1, 2008, was
estimated to be 14,355 (DOF 2008b). Median home prices in South Lake Tahoe declined by 6.2 percent during a
one-year period (November 2006 to November 2007), from $453,000 to $425,000 (CSLT 2008b:4-52).
Vacancy trends in housing are analyzed using a vacancy rate to establish the relationship between housing supply
and demand. If the demand for housing units is greater than the available supply, then the vacancy rate is low and
the price of housing will most likely increase. According to the California Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD), a housing vacancy rate of 5 percent is considered normal (HCD 2000).
Vacancy rates below 5 percent indicate a housing shortage in a community. The city had a vacancy rate of 2.0
percent for owner-occupied units and 8.3 percent for rental units in 2000 (CSLT 2008b:4-28).
As in any tourist destination, a large portion of the housing units in South Lake Tahoe are seasonal, second homes.
Because the U.S. Census is collected in April during the city’s low tourist season, most of these units are measured
as vacant. Of the 14,005 housing units in the city in 2000, 4,595 housing units (32.8 percent) were reported to be
vacant at the time of the U.S. Census (U.S. Census Bureau 2000). The majority of these vacant units (26.3 percent of
the total housing stock) were for seasonal, recreational, or occasional use (CSLT 2008a:3-11).
Employment
The Lake Tahoe region, including South Lake Tahoe, has a primarily tourist-based economy. The impact of
visitors to Lake Tahoe on the economy of the Lake Tahoe region was studied in the 2001 Threshold Evaluation
(TRPA 2002). Estimates generated by the report indicated that visitors to the region spent more than $1.5 billion
on travel-related goods and services in 2000. Businesses that depend primarily on travel and tourism, such as

lodging establishments, gaming, restaurants, and recreation services, provide a major source of employment and
payroll in the Lake Tahoe region (TRPA 2002).
Table 3.15-3 shows the total number of those employed by major industries who resided in the South Lake Tahoe
in 2005. Employed citizens totaled 14,559. Of these, approximately 8,089 (55.6 percent) worked in the services
industry, including 3,889 hotel and lodging workers, 648 entertainment and recreation workers, and 1,221 health
and medical services workers. Retail trade was the second largest industry, with 3,833 workers (26.3 percent),
including 1,139 restaurant workers. Many companies in the service industry and retail trade employ a seasonal
workforce that is often composed of younger or college-aged workers (CSLT 2008b:4-24).

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES AND MITIGATION MEASURES

SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA
For this analysis, significance criteria are based on the checklist presented in Appendix G of the State CEQA
Guidelines; the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist; factual or scientific information and data; and regulatory
standards of federal, state, and local agencies. Additional criteria related to socioeconomics (and presented as
NEPA criteria) are based on other recent environmental documents prepared by Reclamation in Northern
California (Reclamation 2008). Together these CEQA, TRPA, and additional NEPA criteria encompass factors
taken into account under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and intensity of
its effects. Under NEPA, the significance of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be
prepared.
Because socioeconomic topics are organized differently in NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA environmental provisions,
the criteria are presented in a combined list, unlike other sections of the environmental document.

3.15-5 Socioeconomics, Population and Housing, and Environmental Justice

An alternative was determined to result in a significant effect related to socioeconomics or population and
housing if it would:
►

induce substantial unplanned population growth in an area, either directly (for example, by proposing new
homes and businesses) or indirectly (for example, through extension of roads or other infrastructure)
(CEQA 1);

►

generate a substantial demand for new housing, the construction of which could cause significant
environmental impacts (CEQA 2);

►

displace substantial numbers of people or existing housing, necessitating the construction of replacement
housing elsewhere (CEQA 3);

►

alter the location, distribution, density, or growth rate of the human population planned for the Lake Tahoe
region (TRPA 1);

►

include or result in the temporary or permanent displacement of residents (TRPA 2);

►

result in the loss of affordable housing (TRPA 3);

►

affect existing housing, or create a demand for additional housing (TRPA 4);

►

require numbers of new workers in a particular industrial sector from outside the local area during
construction or operation for effective implementation (NEPA 1);

►

cause a substantial decrease in the number of opportunities for short-term or long-term direct employment
(NEPA 2);

►

displace, relocate, or increase area businesses associated with an increase in recreational users (NEPA 3);

►

compete with established industries for workers within the labor force or associated resources to the extent
that there would be a shortage of workers available to related businesses (NEPA 4);

►

cause a substantial decrease in the number of opportunities for temporary or long-term increases in personal
and/or disposable incomes (NEPA 5); or

►

considerably decrease the sales and/or incomes of businesses (NEPA 6).

DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH AND ADVERSE CRITERIA
Based on CEQ and EPA guidelines (CEQ 1997, EPA 1998), an alternative was determined to result in an
environmental justice issue if the project would cause impacts to low-income or minority populations that are
disproportionately high and adverse, either directly, indirectly, or cumulatively. To make a finding that
disproportionately high and adverse impacts would likely fall on a minority or low-income population, all three of
the following conditions must be met:
►
►
►

a minority or low-income population must reside in the affected area,
a substantial and adverse impact must exist, and
the impact on the minority or low-income population must be disproportionately high and adverse.

The CEQ guidance indicates that, when determining whether the effects are high and adverse, agencies are to
consider whether the risks or rates of impact are significant (as defined by NEPA) or above generally accepted
norms.

No TRPA significance criteria are applicable to the socioeconomic or environmental justice impacts of the
project.

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
The examination of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics in this section is based on information
obtained from review of existing conditions and available projections, including those in the City of Lake Tahoe
General Plan Update Background Report (CSLT 2008a) the draft Housing Element of the City of Lake Tahoe
General Plan (CSLT 2008b), and projections made by the U.S. Census Bureau (2000), DOF (2008a, 2008b), and
other sources.
According to CEQ and EPA guidelines, a minority population is present in an affected area if the minority
population of the affected area exceeds 50 percent, or if the minority population percentage of the affected area is
meaningfully greater than the minority population percentage in the general population or other appropriate unit
of geographic analysis. Under the same guidelines, a low-income population exists if the affected area is
composed of 50 percent or more people living below the poverty threshold, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau,
or if the percentage of people living below the poverty threshold in the area is significantly greater than the
poverty percentage of the general population or other appropriate unit of geographic analysis. For the purposes of
an environmental justice screening, race, ethnic origin, and poverty status were obtained for South Lake Tahoe
and El Dorado County. The city and county boundaries represent an area that is appropriate for consideration of
environmental justice issues pursuant to EPA guidelines.
Implementation of Alternatives 1–4 would involve construction activities and associated employment
opportunities, housing demand, and commercial activity. The estimated number of workers required for these
activities are summarized in Appendix D, “Construction Workers and Equipment for Action Alternatives.” For
this analysis, it was assumed that each year the total number of construction workers would not exceed the sum of
the workers estimated for all activities that year.

IMPACTS NOT DISCUSSED FURTHER IN THIS EIR/EIS/EIS
Socioeconomics, Populations, and Housing
Displace substantial numbers of people or existing housing (CEQA 3; TRPA 2, 3)—No residences are located
in the project’s study area. Therefore, the project would not directly displace substantial numbers of people or
existing housing.
Decrease opportunities for employment or income increases, or considerably decrease the sales and/or
incomes of businesses (NEPA 2, 5, 6)—No businesses are located within the study area and minimal commercial
activity occurs in the study area. Furthermore, both construction of any project alternative and subsequent
increases in recreational visitors to the study area would increase opportunities for employment or income
increase, and sales and/or incomes of businesses. Therefore, the project would not decrease opportunities for
employment or income increases, or sales and/or incomes of businesses.
Environmental Justice Issues
As discussed above and shown in Tables 3.15-1 and 3.15-2, no minority and low-income populations
exceed 50 percent in South Lake Tahoe or El Dorado County. The city’s slightly higher poverty rate is
not meaningfully greater than the county’s rate, and both the city and county poverty rates are
proportionally less than the statewide rate of 18.6 percent. Therefore, no disproportionately high and
adverse impacts on minority or low-income populations would occur and this topic is not discussed
further.

IMPACT ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
Alternative 1: Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
IMPACT
3.15-1
(Alt. 1)

Short-Term Increase in Population and Housing Demand Resulting from Construction-Related
Activities. (NEPA 1, 4; CEQA 1, 2; TRPA 1, 4) Alternative 1 would generate a temporary increase in
employment in South Lake Tahoe from construction-related activities. However, the number of existing
construction workers in the city and region is considered sufficient to meet the demands associated with
Alternative 1; therefore, this temporary increase in employment is not expected to generate any substantial
population growth in the study area or generate the need for additional housing for construction workers. This
impact would be less than significant.

Project construction would occur over a four-year period, and the number of construction jobs would vary by
year. Construction activities would require up to an estimated 41 construction workers during both Year 1 and
Year 2, 84 construction workers during Year 3, and 12 construction workers during Year 4. Compared to the other
alternatives, Alternative 1 would require a similar number of workers during Years 1 and 2 (Alternatives 2–4
would require 34–46 workers during Years 1–2). During Year 3, Alternative 1 would require a similar number of
workers to Alternative 2, somewhat more than Alternative 3, and more than Alternative 4 during Year 3
(Alternatives 2–4 would require 85, 68, and 35 workers, respectively, during Year 3). During Year 4, this
alternative would require the same number of workers as Alternatives 2–4.
According to the latest labor data available from the U.S. Census Bureau (2000), 306 city residents are employed
in the construction industry (Table 3.15-3). This number would likely be sufficient to meet the demands
associated with Alternative 1. It is also possible that construction workers may come from nearby communities
such as Sacramento, Carson City, and Reno. Because of the short-term nature of the construction season in the
Tahoe Basin, it is common for workers to commute from these nearby communities. Consequently, neither
substantial population growth nor an increase in housing demand in the region is anticipated. Therefore, the
project would not be expected to generate the need for substantial additional housing in South Lake Tahoe during
construction. Because of these conditions, the impact of a temporary increase in population growth and housing
demand associated with project construction would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.15-2
(Alt. 1)

Potential Long-Term Effect on Sales or Incomes of Local Businesses Resulting from Additional
Visitors to the Study Area. (NEPA 3) Alternative 1 includes improved recreation facilities that could attract
additional visitors to the study area, potentially increasing commercial activity at local businesses in South
Lake Tahoe. However, minimal commercial activity would be associated with this increase in use because it
would primarily result from residents of adjacent neighborhoods responding to greater connectivity between
the Tahoe Keys and Al Tahoe neighborhoods, and these residents already use local businesses. Therefore,
Alternative 1 would not negatively affect sales or incomes of local businesses. This impact would be less
than significant.

Alternative 1 would modify or add recreation facilities to the study area that could attract visitors, potentially
increasing commercial activity at local businesses in South Lake Tahoe. These facilities would include kiosks,
bicycle paths and pedestrian trails, two boardwalks, observation platforms and viewpoints, and a boardwalk and
bridge across the Upper Truckee River. The proposed bridge and boardwalk over the Upper Truckee River would
be a new public access element in the study area.
However, based on observations of recreation use of the study area, the improved recreation infrastructure is
expected, in large part, to serve the existing residents of neighborhoods adjacent to the study area who already use
local businesses. (Potential effects on recreational use of the study area are described in detail in Section 3.13,
“Recreation.”) Thus, any increase in commercial activity from the attraction of additional visitors would be
minimal. Also, minimal commercial activity would be directly associated with the use of facilities constructed and

operated under this alternative. Therefore, Alternative 1 would not adversely affect sales or incomes of local
businesses, and the long-term impact would be less than significant.
Alternative 2: New Channel—West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure)
IMPACT
3.15-1
(Alt. 2)

Short-Term Increase in Population and Housing Demand Resulting from Construction-Related
Activities. (NEPA 1, 4; CEQA 1, 2; TRPA 1, 4) Alternative 2 would generate a temporary increase in
employment in South Lake Tahoe from construction-related activities. However, the number of existing
construction workers in the city and region is considered sufficient to meet the demands associated with
Alternative 2; therefore, this temporary increase in employment is not expected to generate any substantial
population growth in the study area or generate the need for additional housing for construction workers. This
impact would be less than significant.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.15-1 (Alt. 1). Construction activities would require up to an estimated 35
construction workers during both Year 1 and Year 2, 85 construction workers during Year 3, and 12 construction
workers during Year 4. Compared to the other alternatives, Alternative 1 would require a similar number of workers
during Years 1 and 2 (Alternatives 1, 3, and 4 would require 34–46 workers during Years 1–2). During Year 3,
Alternative 2 would require a similar number of workers to Alternative 1 and more than Alternatives 3 and 4
(Alternatives 1, 3 and 4 would require 84, 68, and 35 workers, respectively, during Year 3). During Year 4, this
alternative would require the same number of workers as Alternatives 1, 3, and 4.
Alternative 2 would generate a temporary increase in employment in South Lake Tahoe from construction-related
activities. The present number of construction workers in the city and surrounding region is considered sufficient
to meet the demands associated with Alternative 2; therefore, this temporary increase in employment is not
expected to generate any substantial population growth in the study area or generate the need for additional
housing for construction workers. This impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.15-2
(Alt. 2)

Potential Long-Term Effect on Sales or Incomes of Local Businesses Resulting from Additional
Visitors to the Study Area. (NEPA 3) Alternative 2 includes improved recreation facilities that could attract
additional visitors to the study area. However, the additional recreational facilities would be limited, and the
increase in use would be expected to be primarily by residents of adjacent neighborhoods. Therefore,
Alternative 2 would not substantially increase the number of visitors, and thus would not considerably affect
the sales or incomes of local businesses. This impact would be less than significant.

Of all of the alternatives, Alternative 2 would modify or create the least public access and recreation infrastructure
(but would include a fishing platform, a pedestrian trail, and viewpoints). (Potential effects on recreational use of
the study area are described in detail in Section 3.13, “Recreation.”)
Because these few additional features would be related to existing recreational activities in the study area, it is
expected that users would be primarily from adjacent neighborhoods, as occurs under existing conditions.
Alternative 2 would not likely attract a substantial number of additional visitors. Thus, any increase in
commercial activity from the attraction of additional visitors would be minimal. Also, minimal commercial
activity would be directly associated with the use of facilities constructed and operated under this alternative.
Therefore, Alternative 2 would not considerably affect the sales or incomes of local businesses. This impact
would be less than significant.

Temporary Increase in Population and Housing Demand Resulting from Construction-Related
Activities. (NEPA 1, 4; CEQA 1, 2; TRPA 1, 4) Alternative 3 would generate a temporary increase in
employment in South Lake Tahoe from construction-related activities. However, the number of existing
construction workers in the city and region is considered sufficient to meet the demands associated with
Alternative 3; therefore, this temporary increase in employment is not expected to generate any substantial
population growth in the study area or generate the need for additional housing for construction workers. This
impact would be less than significant.

This impact is similar to Impact 3.15-1 (Alt. 1). Construction activities would require up to an estimated 38
construction workers during Year 1, 46 construction workers during Year 2, 68 construction workers in Year 3,
and 12 construction workers in Year 4. Compared to the other alternatives, Alternative 3 would require a similar
number of workers during Years 1 and 2 (Alternatives 1, 2, and 4 would require 34–41 workers during Years 1–
2). During Year 3, Alternative 3 would require fewer workers than Alternatives 1 and 2, but more than Alternative
4 (Alternatives 1, 2, and 4 would require 84, 85, and 35 workers, respectively, during Year 3). During Year 4, this
alternative would require the same number of workers as Alternatives 1, 2, and 4.
Alternative 3 would generate a temporary increase in employment in South Lake Tahoe from construction-related
activities. However, the present number of construction workers in the city and region is considered sufficient to
meet the demands associated with Alternative 3; therefore, this temporary increase in employment is not expected
to generate any substantial population growth in the study area or generate the need for additional housing for
construction workers. This impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.15-2
(Alt. 3)

Potential Long-Term Effect on Sales or Incomes of Local Businesses Resulting from Additional
Visitors to the Study Area. (NEPA 3) Alternative 3 includes improved recreation facilities that could attract
additional visitors to the study area, potentially increasing commercial activity at local businesses in South
Lake Tahoe. However, this increase in use is expected to be primarily by residents of adjacent neighborhoods
who already use local businesses. Overall, the number of additional visitors would not be substantial, and
minimal commercial activity would be associated with this alternative. Therefore, Alternative 3 would not
considerably affect the sales or incomes of local businesses. This impact would be less than significant.

Relative to the other alternatives, Alternative 3 would modify or create an intermediate level of public access and
recreation infrastructure (including a kiosk, pedestrian trails, fishing access, viewpoints, and an observation
platform). These features could attract additional visitors to the study area, which could increase commercial
activity at local businesses. (Potential effects on recreational use of the study area are described in detail in
Section 3.13, “Recreation.”)
Because additional features are limited and would be related to existing recreational activities in the study area, it
is expected that users would be primarily from adjacent neighborhoods, as occurs under existing conditions. Thus,
Alternative 3 would not likely cause a substantial number of additional visitors. Thus, any increase in commercial
activity from the attraction of additional visitors would be minimal. Also, minimal commercial activity would be
directly associated with the use of facilities constructed and operated under this alternative. Therefore, Alternative

require 84, 85, and 68 workers, respectively, during Year 3). During Year 4, this alternative would require the
same number of workers as Alternatives 1–3.
Alternative 4 would generate a temporary increase in employment in South Lake Tahoe from construction-related
activities. However, the present number of construction personnel in the city and region is considered sufficient to
meet the demands associated with Alternative 4; therefore, this temporary increase in employment is not expected
to generate any substantial population growth in the study area or generate the need for additional housing for
construction workers. This impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.15-2
(Alt. 4)

Potential Long-Term Effect on Sales or Incomes of Local Businesses Resulting from Additional
Visitors to the Study Area. (NEPA 3) Alternative 4 includes improved recreation facilities that could attract
additional visitors to the study area, potentially increasing commercial activity at local businesses in South
Lake Tahoe. However, this increase in use is expected to be primarily by residents of adjacent neighborhoods
who already use local businesses. Overall, the number of additional visitors would not be substantial, and
minimal commercial activity would be associated with this alternative. Therefore, Alternative 4 would not
considerably affect the sales or incomes of local businesses. This impact would be less than significant.

Relative to the other alternatives, Alternative 4 would modify or create an intermediate level of public access and
recreation infrastructure (including a kiosk, pedestrian trails, viewpoints, and observation platforms). These
features could attract additional visitors to the study area, which could increase commercial activity at local
businesses. (Potential effects on recreational use of the study area are described in detail in Section 3.13,
“Recreation.”)
Because additional features are limited and would be related to existing recreational activities in the study area, it
is expected that users would be primarily from adjacent neighborhoods, as occurs under existing conditions. Thus,
Alternative 4 would not likely cause a substantial number of additional visitors. Thus, any increase in commercial
activity from the attraction of additional visitors would be minimal. Also, minimal commercial activity would be
directly associated with the use of facilities constructed and operated under this alternative. Therefore, Alternative
4 would not considerably affect the sales or incomes of local businesses. This impact would be less than
significant.

construction-related activities. No impact would occur.

As the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, Alternative 5 would not include any construction activities. No
construction workers would be employed to build recreation facilities or other elements of the project. Therefore,
this alternative would not cause a temporary increase in population and housing demand resulting from
construction-related activities. No impact would occur.

area, and thus would not affect sales or incomes of local businesses. No impact would occur.

Under Alternative 5, no additional recreation facilities would be constructed, and existing facilities would not be
expanded. Levels of recreation use would be expected to remain similar to current levels. Because Alternative 5
would not result in additional visitors to the study area, it would not affect sales levels or incomes of local
businesses. No impact would occur.

This section describes the regulations related to transportation, parking, and circulation, along with the existing
transportation infrastructure in the study area; identifies significance criteria for potential impacts on
transportation facilities; and evaluates the significance of potential impacts associated with implementing the
project alternatives, including possible effects on parking capacity and traffic circulation. Section 3.12, “Public
Services,” discusses effects resulting from roadway obstruction during construction and associated mitigation.

3.16.1

AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

REGULATORY SETTING
This section describes the federal, state, and regional and local transportation-related standards and criteria that
may apply to the project.
Federal
A number of statutes and regulations exist that include provisions specific to the interstate system in California
and transportation projects in general. Title 23 of the U.S. Code (USC) and Title 23 of the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) are the laws governing highways, and 23 USC and CFR 49 are the laws governing
transportation.
The following federal legislative statutes also may apply to surface transportation and other transportation aspects
of the project:
►
►
►
►
►

Federal Clean Air Act;
Federal Transit Act;
Americans with Disabilities Act;
Civil Rights Act; and
Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users.

Federal statutes specify the procedures that the U.S. Department of Transportation must follow in setting policy
regarding the placement of utility facilities within the rights-of-way of roadways that received federal funding.
These include expressways, most state highways, and certain local roads. Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA) regulations require that each state develop its own policy regarding the accommodation of utility
facilities within the rights-of-way of such roads. After FHWA has approved a state’s policy, the state can approve
any proposed utility installation without referral to FHWA, unless utility installation does not conform to the
policy.
Federal law does not directly control how states accommodate utilities within highway rights-of-way; however, in
determining whether a right-of-way on a federally-funded highway should be used for accommodating a utility
facility, the Secretary of Transportation must (1) ascertain the effect that accommodating utilities would have on
highway and traffic safety because no use may be authorized or permitted that would adversely affect safety,
(2) evaluate the direct and indirect environmental and economic effects of any loss of productive agricultural land
or any impairment of its productivity that would result from disapproving accommodation of the utility facility,
and (3) consider the environmental and economic effects together with any interference with or impairment of the
use of the highway that would result from accommodation of the utility facility (23 USC Section 109[l]). In
addition, 23 USC Section 116 requires state highway agencies to ensure proper maintenance of highway facilities,
which implies adequate control over nonhighway facilities, such as utility facilities. Finally, 23 USC Section 123
specifies when federal funds can be used to pay for the costs of relocating utility facilities in connection with
highway construction projects (McCarthy 2004).

State
The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) plans, designs, constructs, and maintains state-owned
roadways. Under agreement with the federal government, Caltrans sites, designs, constructs, and maintains
federal highways, including the highways in the Interstate Highway System. Caltrans’s Standard Specifications
(Caltrans 2006) establish uniform design and construction procedures for California and federal highways.
The specifications are used by local departments of transportation for local roads. The highway design criteria and
policies in the Standard Specifications ensure minimum design, contract, and construction standards for road
projects. U.S. Highway 50 (U.S. 50), a portion of which is located in the study area, is maintained by Caltrans
District 3, headquartered in Marysville, California.
Tahoe Regional Planning Agency
Standards and performance targets identified by the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) are presented in
the Transportation Element of the Regional Plan for the Lake Tahoe Basin: Goals and Policies (TRPA 2006), the
TRPA threshold evaluation reports (TRPA 2002, 2007), and Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan – Mobility
2030 (RTP) (Tahoe Metropolitan Planning Organization and TRPA 2008). Table 3.16-1 summarizes the
applicable standards or criteria of each of the plans and policies. TRPA policies and standards related to bicycle
and pedestrian pathway facilities are described in Section 3.13, “Recreation.”

Standard/Criteria

Tahoe Regional
Planning Compact
(1980)

Transportation planning in the region is required (1) to reduce dependency on the automobile by
making more effective use of existing transportation modes and of public transit to move people and
goods in the region and (2) to reduce to the extent feasible air pollution caused by motor vehicles.

TRPA thresholds
(2007)

The thresholds that involve transportation issues are intended to reduce air quality problems as
follows:
Air Quality: Subregional Visibility & Nitrate Deposition
Reduce Vehicle Miles of Travel in the basin by 10% of the 1981 base year values.

TRPA Regional Plan
Goals and Policies
(2006)

The Transportation Element of the Goals and Policies establishes general goals to be further defined
by the RTP. This section sets the following level of service standards: LOS D for urban roads and
LOS D, with brief periods (no more than four hours) of LOS E, for signalized intersections. There
are no standards for unsignalized intersections.

Lake Tahoe Regional Desired Condition 2: Environmental Impacts: The transportation system is integrated with
Transportation Plan
environmental goals in conjunction with the TRPA threshold areas as part of the TRPA RTP.
(2008)
Environmental performance indicators are vehicle miles traveled and traffic volumes.

Regional Plan Goals and Policies
The formulation of regional transportation goals and policies is a fundamental step in the transportation planning
process. The Goals and Policies reflect the consideration of environmental, social, and economic factors in
making transportation-related decisions.
Regional Transportation Goals
1. It is the goal of the Regional Transportation Plan to attain and maintain the Environmental Threshold
Carrying Capacities and federal, state, and local transportation standards.
2. It is the goal of the Regional Transportation Plan to establish a safe, efficient, and integrated transportation
system which reduces reliance on the private automobile, provides for alternative modes of transportation,
and serves the basic transportation needs of the citizens of the Tahoe Region, supports the economic base of
the Region in the movement of goods and people, and minimizes adverse impacts on man and the
environment.
Regional Transportation Policies and Objectives
1. Plan for and promote land use changes and development patterns which will encourage the use of alternative
transportation modes and minimize impacts on the existing transportation system.
A. Community Plans shall promote land use development patterns and designs which will increase the
ability to use public transportation, waterborne, bicycle and pedestrian facilities.
B. New, expanded or revised developments and land uses shall fully mitigate their regional and cumulative
traffic impacts.
C. Parking for non-residential uses shall be the minimum/maximum required to meet the demand for parking
generated by the use, except as may be offset by reducing parking demand through parking management
and trip reduction programs.
D. Driveways shall be designed and sited to minimize impacts on public transportation, adjacent roadways
and intersections, bicycle and pedestrian facilities.
2. Develop and encourage the use of pedestrian and bicycle facilities as a safe and viable alternative to
automobile use.
A. Pedestrian and bicycle facilities shall be constructed, or upgraded, and maintained along major travel
routes.
B. Bicycle and pedestrian facilities in urbanized areas and along transportation routes used for commuting
should be maintained to allow year-around use of the facilities.
3. Transportation System Management (TSM) measures shall be used to improve the efficiency of the existing
transportation system.
A. Traffic conflicts should be reduced by limiting or controlling access to major regional travel routes and
major local road ways.
B. Intersection improvements required to upgrade existing levels of service including lane restriping, turn
lanes, channelization and traffic signals should be implemented when warranted.

C. Roadway designs shall accommodate bicycle lanes and transit stops and reduce conflicts between
vehicles and bicycle and pedestrians.
D. Left-turn lanes and right-turn lanes shall be provided to reduce turning conflicts along major travel routes.
4. Limit improvements to the regional highway system to those necessary to meet the Goals and Policies of the
Regional Plan.
Level of service (LOS) criteria for the Region’s highway system and signalized intersections during peak
periods shall be:
•
•
•
•
•

Level of service “C” on rural recreational/scenic roads.
Level of service “D” on rural developed area roads.
Level of service “D” on urban developed area roads.
Level of service “D” for signalized intersections.
Level of service “E” may be acceptable during peak periods in urban areas, not to exceed four hours per day.

Lake Tahoe Regional Transportation Plan—Mobility 2030 (Goals and Policies, Action Element)
Of the plans summarized in Table 3.16-1, the RTP provides the most detailed direction for transportation program
development in the study area. The Tahoe Regional Planning Compact (the Compact) states that the goals of
transportation planning shall be to reduce to the extent feasible air pollution caused by motor vehicles and to
reduce dependency on the automobile by making more effective use of existing transportation modes and public
transit to move people and goods in the region. The purpose of the RTP is to attain and maintain the
environmental threshold carrying capacities (thresholds) established by TRPA in 1982 and all applicable federal,
state, and local standards established for transportation and air quality.
The TRPA transportation thresholds address carbon monoxide, ozone, regional and subregional visibility, and
nitrate deposition. There are numerical standards for each of these parameters, in addition to management
standards that are intended to assist in attaining the thresholds. The management standards include the reduction
of wood smoke, maintenance of oxides of nitrogen levels, reduction of U.S. 50 traffic volumes, and reduction of
vehicle miles traveled (VMT). The Compact also states that the RTP shall provide for attaining and maintaining
federal, state, or local air quality standards, whichever are strictest, in the respective portions of the region for
which the standards are applicable.
The RTP establishes goals, policies, and actions that would be implemented over the planning horizon (i.e., up to
2030). Environmental indicators of reduced VMT and traffic delays would be achieved through land use and
transportation decision making. The plan does not apply to short-term construction-related effects. The goal most
applicable to the project is to “[d]esign an atmosphere that encourages bicycle and pedestrian usage as a viable
and significant mode of transportation at Lake Tahoe.” The following policies to achieve this goal are applicable
to the project:
A. The RTP and Lake Tahoe Region Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan (Bike/Ped Plan) shall contain a list of
existing and proposed bicycle and pedestrian facilities and policies for the development of any new
bicycle/pedestrian facilities in the Lake Tahoe Region.
B. Pedestrian and bicycle facilities consistent with the RTP and Bike/Ped Plan shall be constructed, upgraded
and maintained.
C. There shall be a high priority on constructing pedestrian and bicycle facilities in urbanized areas and in areas
that increase connectivity of the bicycle network.

G. Projects funded all or in part with TMPO [Tahoe Metropolitan Planning Organization] administered funding
shall include the accommodation of bicycle and pedestrian facilities in the earliest stages of project
development. The TMPO shall not release funds for projects that do not show accommodation of bicycle and
pedestrian needs.
H. Bicycle and pedestrian linkages shall be provided between residential and non-residential areas.
I.

Maintenance policies for bicycle and pedestrian facilities should reflect usage and consider maintaining routes
to allow for year-round use of the facilities where appropriate.

K. Safety awareness signage, road markings and educational programs, as well as programs that encourage
bicycling and walking, shall be implemented where appropriate.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
This section identifies the existing transportation facilities and describes traffic conditions for the roadway
network in the study area. Exhibit 3.16-1 presents the roadway network in the study area.
Roadway System
The major internal road system in the study area includes the following roadways.
U.S. 50, the first California highway, is the primary route providing access to and through the city of South Lake
Tahoe. U.S. 50 connects the city with Sacramento, California, to the west via Echo Summit and with Carson City,
Nevada, to the east via Spooner Summit. From the signalized U.S. 50/State Route (SR) 89 intersection with Lake
Tahoe Boulevard (the “Y”), SR 89 continues north/northwest and is also designated as Emerald Bay Road.
Southeast and northeast of the Y, U.S. 50 is designated as Lake Tahoe Boulevard as it heads east through the city
toward Stateline, Nevada, and south into the county area.
The physical characteristics of U.S. 50 vary in the Tahoe Basin. As the highway enters the Tahoe Basin from the
south, U.S. 50 is a two-lane roadway. The posted speed along the two-lane segment ranges from 40 to 50 miles per
hour (mph). At approximately F Street in the city of South Lake Tahoe, U.S. 50 becomes a four-lane highway with a
continuous center left-turn lane and a posted speed of 50 mph (although the speed limit drops from 50 to 40 mph
at H Street and to 35 mph near D Street). U.S. 50 continues east through the city as a four-lane roadway with a
continuous center turn lane and a speed limit of 35 mph.
SR 89 merges with U.S. 50 in the community of Meyers, south of the city of South Lake Tahoe. From the Y, SR
89/Emerald Bay Road diverges from U.S. 50 and continues north/northwest. SR 89 is a two-lane road in the basin,
except for a four-lane segment between F Street and West Way. Speed limits on SR 89 range from 40–50 mph south
of the city to 35 mph in town. SR 89 continues north around the west shore of Lake Tahoe to Tahoe City, then heads
northwest to the Town of Truckee, Interstate 80, and beyond to the north/northwest of Truckee.
Tahoe Keys Boulevard provides access to the west side of the study area via East Venice Drive (see below) from a
signalized T-intersection at Lake Tahoe Boulevard (U.S. 50). Tahoe Keys Boulevard is a two-lane road with a posted
speed of 30 mph. As it enters the Tahoe Keys development (Tahoe Keys), it has a landscaped center median and
striped on-street bicycle lanes. Tahoe Keys Boulevard terminates in Tahoe Keys in a cul-de-sac adjacent to the lake.
East Venice Drive is a two-lane road that provides direct access to the west side of the study area and to the Tahoe
Keys Marina, east of Tahoe Keys Boulevard. It becomes Venice Drive where it crosses Tahoe Keys Boulevard, and
it extends through a portion of Tahoe Keys. The speed limit on Venice Drive and East Venice Drive is 25 mph.

Fifteenth Street is a two-lane local street that links Venice Drive with SR 89 at the west end of Tahoe Keys. The
posted speed limit on Fifteenth Street is 25 mph.
Rubicon Trail is one of several two-lane roads that provide access to the Highland Woods neighborhood, which
abuts the southeast end of the study area. Rubicon Trail originates at a signalized intersection at U.S. 50 and
continues north to Springwood Drive. The posted speed limit on Rubicon Trail is 25 mph.
Springwood Drive is a two-lane roadway that provides direct access to the homes adjacent to a portion of the
southern boundary of the study area. The posted speed limit on Springwood Drive is 25 mph.
Silver Dollar Avenue is a local two-lane roadway that extends generally north from an unsignalized intersection
on U.S. 50 to Springwood Drive. The posted speed limit on Silver Dollar Avenue is 25 mph.
Lodi Avenue is a two-lane roadway that extends north and south from an unsignalized intersection on U.S. 50. It
provides access to the study area via Ponderosa Street and Conestoga Street. There are no speed limit signs on this
section of Lodi Avenue.
Lakeview Avenue is a two-lane roadway that is one of numerous routes that link the Al Tahoe neighborhood,
which is adjacent to the east side of the study area, with U.S. 50. It extends for more than 0.5 mile from the
project boundary to a signalized intersection on U.S. 50. The posted speed limit on Lakeview Avenue is 25 mph.
San Francisco Avenue is a two-lane roadway that extends from the eastern boundary of the study area to an
unsignalized intersection on U.S. 50. There are no speed limit signs on this section of San Francisco Avenue.
Existing Traffic Volumes
Weekday peak-hour turning movement counts were performed by KD Anderson & Associates, Inc. in September
2007 (from 7 to 9 a.m. and from 4 to 6 p.m.) at key intersections to supplement 1999 data assembled for the
Lower West Side Wetland Restoration Project and traffic counts conducted in August 2000 by CSS Planning and
Engineering. The intersections selected for analysis are critical intersections for existing traffic. Some or all of these
intersections are expected to incur the highest volume of project-related construction traffic, depending on the
alternative being evaluated. The September 2007 counts were factored to peak month (August) values based on
seasonal factors provided by TRPA. Counts were conducted at the following intersections:

The lane configurations, existing turning movement counts, and traffic control devices are illustrated in Exhibit
3.16-2. To provide additional perspective on current traffic conditions, 24-hour traffic volume counts were
conducted in September 2007 on roadways that could provide access, including construction access, to the study
area. These counts were also factored to weekday peak-month levels based on seasonal factors provided by
TRPA. The seasonal factors were calibrated by TMPO (Tahoe Metropolitan Planning Organization) using a
graphic information system (GIS)–based traffic model package (TransCAD) developed by Parsons Brinckerhoff
Quade & Douglas Inc. Additional information concerning the TransCAD model development and calibration
efforts are referenced in Lake Tahoe Resident and Visitor Model; Model Description and Final Results; Parsons
Brinckerhoff Quade & Douglas Inc., August 2007. Table 3.16-2 shows actual daily counts and estimated weekday
peak-month levels.

Intersection Level of Service
Intersections are evaluated in terms of level of service (LOS), which is a measure of driving conditions and
vehicle delay. LOS ranges from A (best) to F (poorest) (Table 3.16-3). LOS A, B, or C indicates conditions where
traffic can move relatively freely. LOS D describes conditions where delay is more noticeable. LOS E describes
conditions where traffic volumes are at or close to capacity, resulting in significant delays and average speeds that
are one-third the uncongested speed or lower. LOS F characterizes conditions where traffic demand exceeds
available capacity, with very slow speeds (stop-and-go traffic) and long delays (more than a minute) and queuing
at signalized intersections.

Signalized intersections are evaluated consistent with the operations method from the 2000 Highway Capacity
Manual using TRAFFIX software (TRB 2000). This method is used to evaluate the amount of green signal time
available to each traffic approach and the total intersection capacity used by the traffic demand, and to assign a
level of service based on the average delay that drivers would experience at the intersection during the peak hour.
The unsignalized intersections were evaluated using the methodology from Chapter 9 of the Highway Capacity
Manual (TRB 2000). At these intersections, each turning movement that yields to an opposing movement is
evaluated separately and assigned a level of service based on the relative ability of turning traffic to find adequate
gaps in conflicting traffic flows.
Existing levels of service were calculated for each study intersection (Table 3.16-4). All the signalized study
intersections operate at LOS A, B, or C with relatively free-flowing movement. Motorists attempting to enter U.S.
50 (Lake Tahoe Boulevard) at unsignalized intersections experience delays that are generally indicative of LOS D
or better conditions, except at the U.S. 50/Lodi Avenue intersection. At that intersection, motorists experience
delays that are representative of LOS E and F conditions in the p.m. peak hour.

Parking Facilities
No formal parking facilities are designated for use by visitors to the study area. Parking is permitted on the public
road rights-of-way. TRPA and the CSLT approved additional Tahoe Keys Marina parking in 2009 and 2010,
respectively, but a final agreement has not been completed. This final long-term lease agreement would create
more than 100 spaces and would provide additional parking for visitors to the marina and study area alike.
The present demand for study area visitor parking was estimated using information from recreation and access
surveys conducted by the Conservancy in 2004 and 2005 (Conservancy 2005). The information reported in the
formal surveys was combined with observations of public use made by the Conservancy’s land stewards during
2003, 2004, 2005, and 2007 (Rozance 2007a, 2007b). This information was compared with the size of parking
facilities at other comparable destinations around Lake Tahoe. Reference sites included Baldwin Beach west and
east lots, Cave Rock, Rabe Meadow, Kiva Beach, Logan Shoals, Mt. Tallac Trailhead, Pope Beach, Secline
Beach, and Skunk Harbor.
Access data were collected by the Conservancy at East Venice Drive, the primary point of access, during 2004
and 2005 (Conservancy 2005). Some visitors also access the study area from adjacent neighborhoods; these
visitors are primarily residents of those neighborhoods, and thus, generate relatively little parking demand. Access
data collected at East Venice Drive indicate that on summer weekends and holidays, for portions of the day, the
number of visitors accessing the study area at East Venice Drive exceeded 20 per hour and once exceeded 40 per
hour (Table 3.16-5). On fall, winter, and spring weekends, the number of visitors accessing the study area
frequently exceeded ten per hour for an hour or more but did not exceed 20 visitors per hour. Overall, the data
collected during 2004 and 2005 show that people visit the study area mostly mid-day during the summer with
parking demand peaking on weekends and holidays.

Data on recreational uses of the study area from 2004–2005 (Conservancy 2005) and land steward observations
during 2003–2007 (Rozance 2007a, 2007b) indicate that a substantial portion of users likely traveled to the study
area alone and that some users walked or bicycled to the study area, particularly from adjacent neighborhoods,
and thus did not contribute to demand for parking. Walking/running has been the most frequent user activity
across all years and months. Bicycle riding has also been a popular activity across most years and months. It is
likely that most of the runners and walkers travel to the study area alone and that most remain in the study area for
only relatively short periods. However, on average, runners and walkers are likely to be in the study area for at
least a half-hour, in part because of the distance from East Venice Drive to Cove East Beach (a primary
destination of users). Runners, walkers, and bicyclists from the Tahoe Islands subdivision on the east side of the
marsh have numerous access locations from the south and east of the study area. Although there is no quantified
data, it is expected that visitors from the adjacent subdivision would access the study area via the southern and
eastern access points. Therefore, these visitors likely do not substantially contribute to parking demand on East
Venice Drive on the west side of the study area.
Other common recreational activities include beach use, picnicking, wildlife viewing, and fishing. Users engaged
in these activities likely remain in the study area for longer periods than walkers/runners and bicyclists. In
addition, they drive to the study area more often and are less likely to drive to the study area alone. Among
months and years, the number of visitors performing these activities varies more than walking/running and
bicycling, but combined, these activities typically accounted for 20–40 percent of observed users.
Assuming a range of likely values for average visit duration (0.75 to 1.25 hours), number of visitors per car
(1.25 to 1.75), and the portion of visitors who do not drive to the study area (10–20 percent), the estimated
number of 20 visitors per hour corresponds to a demand for seven to 18 parking spaces, 25 visitors per hour
corresponds to nine to 23 parking spaces, and 30 visitors per hour corresponds to 10–27 parking spaces.
(Assumptions were applied by subtracting the portion of users not driving to the study area, dividing the
remaining number of visitors per hour by the number of visitors per car, and multiplying the number by the
average duration of a visit.)
Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
No designated Class I (pedestrian and bicycle shared-use paths), Class II (bicycle lanes), or Class III (bicycle
routes) bicycle and pedestrian facilities are located in the study area. Class I facilities are physically separated
from automotive traffic. Class II facilities are not physically separated from traffic, but the bicycle lane is
designated with striping. Class III facilities do not have striping, but signs are posted to alert drivers that they are
sharing the traveling width with a bicycle route. Class designations are determined based on traffic, lane
configurations, and available rights-of-way. A Class II–designated bicycle facility exists on Tahoe Keys
Boulevard, providing bicycle access to the west side of the study area from U.S. 50. U.S. 50, along the study area
boundary on the south, has bicycle facilities that alternate between Class III and Class I designations. North from
U.S. 50 and on the east side of the study area, El Dorado Avenue and Bellevue Avenue have Class III bicycle
facilities. From its intersection with Bellevue Avenue heading east away from the study area, Lakeview Avenue
has Class II bicycle facilities. Exhibits 2-1through 2-4 show the existing bicycle and pedestrian facilities in the
study area.
Ground Transit Facilities
BlueGO, a service provided by Tahoe Transportation District, provides fixed-route, demand-response service, ski
shuttles, seasonal trolley service, and commuter express routes on the south shore of Lake Tahoe and to the
Carson Valley. BlueGO is a coordinated public/private transportation system for the South Lake Tahoe and South
Shore region of Lake Tahoe that combines the resources of previously offered services under one management.
Buses on Route 52 provide service to Al Tahoe, east of the study area, and buses on Route 55 serve the Tahoe
Keys Marina, west of the study area (Tahoe Transportation District 2012).

Waterborne Transit Facilities
No public ferries or water taxis operate on Lake Tahoe. In 2005, U.S. Congress approved $8,000,000 for a ferry
project on Lake Tahoe, and the ferry was identified in the RTP. TRPA is heading the project in cooperation with
the Tahoe Transportation District, which comprises local transportation districts, Caltrans, and the Nevada
Department of Transportation. Caltrans funded a site selection study that considered South Lake Tahoe as a
potential service hub (Fox 2006). A private company has been providing amphibious-vehicle tours from Heavenly
Village in South Lake Tahoe since 2009.
Airport Facilities
Lake Tahoe Airport is the airport closest to the study area. The north approach of the airport is located
approximately 1.15 miles (6,060 feet) south of the U.S. 50 crossing over the Upper Truckee River in South Lake
Tahoe. The north approach is located approximately 1.90 miles south of the entrance to the Tahoe Keys Marina.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES AND MITIGATION MEASURES

SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA
For this analysis, significance criteria are based on the checklist presented in Appendix G of the State CEQA
Guidelines; the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist; factual information; scientific data; and regulatory
standards of federal, state, and local agencies. In development of mitigation measures for significant impacts of
the project, effects on environmental thresholds of the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact were considered. The
project’s effects on thresholds are further described in Section 4.5, “Consequences for Environmental Threshold
Carrying Capacities.”
CEQA Criteria
Under CEQA, an alternative was determined to result in a significant effect related to transportation, parking, or
circulation if it would:
►

►

►

►

►

►

conflict with an applicable plan, ordinance or policy establishing measures of effectiveness for the
performance of the circulation system, taking into account all modes of transportation including mass transit
and nonmotorized travel and relevant components of the circulation system, including but not limited to
intersections, streets, highways and freeways, pedestrian and bicycle paths, and mass transit (CEQA 1);
conflict with an applicable congestion management program, including, but not limited to level of service
standards and travel demand measures, or other standards established by the county congestion management
agency for designated roads or highways (CEQA 2);
result in a change in air traffic patterns, including either an increase in traffic levels or a change in location
that results in substantial safety risks (CEQA 3);
substantially increase hazards because of a design feature (e.g., sharp curves or dangerous intersections) or
incompatible uses (e.g., farm equipment) (CEQA 4);
result in inadequate emergency access (CEQA 5); or
conflict with adopted policies, plans, or programs regarding public transit, bicycle, or pedestrian facilities, or
otherwise decrease the performance or safety of such facilities (CEQA 6).

NEPA Criteria
An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the
environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the proposed action. Under NEPA, the significance
of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account
under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of its context and the intensity of its effects are
encompassed by the CEQA criteria used for this analysis.
TRPA Criteria
Based on TRPA’s Initial Environmental Checklist, an alternative would result in a significant impact on
transportation, parking, or circulation if it would:
►

generate 100 or more new Daily Vehicle Trip Ends (DVTE) (TRPA 1);

►

result in changes to existing parking facilities or demand for new parking (TRPA 2);

►

substantially affect existing transportation systems, including highway, transit, bicycle, or pedestrian facilities
(TRPA 3);

►

alter present patterns of circulation or movement of people and/or goods (TRPA 4);

►

alter waterborne, rail, or air traffic (TRPA 5); or

►

increase traffic hazards to motor vehicles, bicyclists, or pedestrians (TRPA 6).

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
The relative impact of implementing the project has been determined by estimating the amount of traffic
associated with construction activities in the study area and superimposing that traffic onto current traffic volume
levels. For this evaluation, a maximum-intensity approach was taken that assumes maximum probable concurrent
employment in the study area, as well as maximum concurrent truck activity.
Construction Employee Traffic
For each project alternative, it was assumed that each construction worker would drive a personal vehicle to the
construction site. In reality, it is more likely that some employees in individual trade groups would carpool to the
job site. As a result, this assumption yields a maximum-intensity view of site trip generation. It has also been
assumed that all the on-site construction workers would arrive at the study area during the a.m. peak hour and that
all would depart during the p.m. peak hour. It is more likely that some employees would arrive and depart during
periods outside of peak commute hours. Therefore, this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS evaluates the potential impacts of a
maximum-intensity scenario for peak-hour construction employee traffic.
Haul Truck Traffic
Haul trucks would travel to and from the study area during construction of each of the alternatives. Most
construction truck activity would be related to hauling surplus material (including excavated soil for certain
alternatives) from the study area to the designated regional disposal area and hauling materials to the study area
for construction of bicycle paths. The amount of truck activity has been estimated based on a review of
preliminary construction quantities for each alternative. The number of truck loads needed to accommodate
identified quantities was estimated over the construction season and spread throughout the typical construction
day to forecast hourly truck traffic.

Localized truck traffic could result as materials are hauled to specific work zones. For example, construction of
bicycle paths along the east side of the study area would require importing decomposed granite and aggregate
base materials that would be hauled by truck. The amount of material would depend on the length of bicycle trail
planned under each alternative.
From the standpoint of traffic impacts, large trucks have a disproportionate impact on operating level of service
and on roadway structures. The length and acceleration/deceleration characteristics of large trucks exceed those of
regular passenger vehicles. Standard engineering practice is to convert each truck to a number of passenger car
equivalents (PCEs) and to use that adjusted volume in LOS calculations. PCE factors range from 2.0 to 4.0. For
the evaluation of each alternative, a PCE of 4.0 has been assumed for each truck.
Regional Trip Distribution
The relative regional distribution of the project’s employee and truck traffic would differ because employee traffic
would be oriented to residential centers throughout the Lake Tahoe/western Nevada area, whereas truck traffic
would be oriented to the sources of imported materials or the disposal sites for exported materials.
The relative assumptions made regarding employee and truck distribution are identified in Table 3.16-6. The
primary route for truck traffic would be to the east on U.S. 50 because this is the route to the Ormsby Landfill.
Employee traffic could originate in areas surrounding the study area but would also be heaviest to the east.

Trip Assignment
Over the course of the construction schedule, various roads can be expected to be used to access individual work
zones and staging areas. The primary staging area would be located off East Venice Drive, and this analysis
assumes that employee commute traffic would be destined for that location. Therefore, Tahoe Keys Boulevard
will be the primary route for construction-related traffic.
Although trucks may be noticeable briefly on these routes at various times over the construction period, they
would not represent an appreciable volume measured on a daily or peak-hour basis. Therefore, for this evaluation,
100 percent of the site traffic for each alternative has been assumed to be directed to the staging area off East
Venice Drive.

Operational Traffic after Construction
The facilities created under the project alternatives could be used by persons who would be attracted to the study
area to use trails or take advantage of scenic vistas. Because of the project’s location, most users would be
expected to be existing residents living near the study area. Table 3.16-5 indicates that the number of visitors to
the site has averaged 100 to 110 per day during peak visitation (i.e., summer weekends and holidays); on the
busiest weekend days, the number of visitors to the project site has exceeded 200 only on rare occasions. As
discussed in Section 3.1, potential increases of the number of visitors would range from slight (Alternative 2
Minimal Recreation Infrastructure) to small (Alternative 1 Maximum Recreation Infrastructure) with alternatives
3 and 4 (moderate recreation infrastructure) falling between Alternatives 1 and 2. The number of new visitor trips
to the site is expected to be limited based on the following reasons:
(1) The recreation and public access elements of the alternatives are related to the existing use of the study area for
dispersed recreation, not to support new uses. Most of these elements are intended to replace existing usercreated features (e.g., trails) and/or reduce the impacts of existing dispersed recreation. For example, proposed
trails follow the routes of or are intended to replace existing user-created trails.
(2) The most popular recreational uses of the study area are walking and running, beach use, wildlife viewing,
and fishing. The Basin has an abundance of locations where people can engage in these activities, and thus,
there is not a substantial unmet need for such recreational opportunities.
(3) Adjacent neighborhoods account for a substantial portion of visitors to the study area and the project would
not alter the number of residents in adjacent neighborhoods nor substantially alter access from adjacent
neighborhoods to the study area.
TRPA requires an evaluation of traffic impacts from the operation of a project, if the project would generate 100
or more new trips per day. Therefore, if implementation of any of the alternatives would double the number of
visitors to the project site, then a traffic impact analysis would be required. None of the alternatives are expected
to generate more than additional 10 to 20 additional trips per day, for the reasons listed above. A traffic impact
analysis was determined to be not required.
Parking Demand
The relative impact of implementing the project on parking demand has been determined by estimating the
number of people using the study area and for what purpose and comparing those numbers with similarly sized
and purposed sites throughout the Lake Tahoe area that have existing parking facilities. During construction,
workers would be required to park in designated parking areas in the construction staging areas.

IMPACTS NOT DISCUSSED FURTHER IN THIS EIR/EIS/EIS
Operational Traffic after Construction (CEQA 1 and 2, in part; TRPA 1, and 4 in part)—Based on the
reasons given in the methods and assumptions, implementation of any of the alternatives would generate less than
100 new trips per day to the project site (between 10 and 20 new trips per day). Therefore, potential impacts on
traffic and circulation would be minimal, and thus less than significant, and are not discussed further in this
section.
Air Traffic and Airport Hazards (CEQA 3, TRPA 5 in part)—None of the proposed alternatives would alter
air traffic patterns because the proposed improvements would be expected to be of interest to local people; a
substantial number of people would not be expected to fly to visit the study area. The potential increase in air
traffic hazards that could result from improving bird and bat habitat in the study area (i.e., increased possibility of
bird and bat strikes on aircraft) is evaluated in Section 3.7, “Human Health/Risk of Upset.” Therefore, potential
impacts on air traffic are not discussed further in this section.

Hazards from Facility Design or Land Use (CEQA 4, TRPA 6)—None of the action alternatives would involve
modifications to existing transportation infrastructure, and there would be no change in the uses of the study area.
Therefore, none of the alternatives would result in a hazard related to design features or land use. This potential
impact is not discussed further in this section.
Emergency Access (CEQA 5)—Potential impacts on emergency access during construction are evaluated in
Section 3.7, “Human Health/Risk of Upset,” and are not discussed further in this section.
Adopted Policies, Plans, or Programs Supporting Alternative Transportation (CEQA 6 and TRPA 5 in
part)—None of the proposed alternatives would result in modifications to Tahoe Keys Marina; therefore, no
alternative would affect the evaluation of South Lake Tahoe for a possible ferry terminal. None of the alternatives
would result in road closures; therefore, no alternative would affect bus services to the study area. None of the
alternatives involve adding or removing bicycle racks; therefore, no alternative would affect access to bicycle
racks. For these reasons, none of the alternatives would interfere with the implementation of adopted policies,
plans, or programs supporting alternative transportation. These topics are not discussed further in this
DEIR/DEIS/DEIS. Effects related to construction traffic management are discussed below.

IMPACT ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
Alternative 1: Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
IMPACT
3.16-1
(Alt. 1)

Increased Traffic on Regional Circulation System during Construction. (CEQA 1, 2; TRPA 4)
Construction of Alternative 1 would add traffic to major roads in the area of the project, but no appreciable
change to current operating levels of service would result during construction. This impact would be less than
significant.

The amount of automobile and truck traffic associated with implementing Alternative 1 would vary throughout
the construction season as different activities occur. Overall, construction activities would require an average of
four truckloads per day. Over the construction period, the truckloads would be hauled on roads through the A1
Tahoe and Highland Woods subdivisions (as shown in Exhibit 2-5). In the Al Tahoe subdivision, trucks would
travel on Lakeview Drive to the Lily Avenue access point, San Francisco Avenue to its access point, and Los
Angeles Avenue to the Bellevue Avenue access point. In the Highland Woods subdivision, trucks would travel on
Rubicon Trail to its access point.
Table 3.16-7 summarizes the traffic characteristics of Alternative 1 regarding construction activities. Table 3.16-8
summarizes peak-hour and daily trip generation for Alternative 1 on both a vehicle and a PCE basis.
Table 3.16-9 identifies peak-hour levels of service at study area intersections during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours
during construction activities under Alternative 1. As indicated, overall levels of service forecast under this
alternative are the same as those occurring under the baseline “existing” condition. Additive construction traffic
compared to existing 24-hour traffic volume counts is shown in Table 3.16-10.
Adopted standards identify LOS D as the minimum acceptable level of service at intersections in developed urban
areas. All the study intersections currently operate at an “overall” level of service of LOS A–LOS C. None of the
study intersections operate at an overall level of service of LOS D–LOS F. The construction-related traffic
operational analysis conducted for this alternative estimates that 84 PCEs would be added during the a.m. and
p.m. peak hours (see Table 3.16-8). The addition of this automobile and truck traffic would not cause any
intersections currently operating at an overall level of service of LOS A–LOS C to operate at an overall level of
service of LOS D–LOS F. At the intersections controlled by side street stop signs, the addition of through traffic
on U.S. 50 resulting from project construction would incrementally increase the length of delays experienced by
motorists waiting to enter the state highway, but project traffic would not change acceptable LOS conditions to
unacceptable conditions. This impact would be less than significant.

IMPACT
3.16-2
(Alt. 1)

Increased Parking Demand. (TRPA 2) Operation of Alternative 1 would increase demand for parking. The
construction-related increase in parking demand would be met by employees parking in designated project
staging areas, and thus would not increase demand for parking during construction. An increase in demand
for parking could result from operation of Alternative 1 because of increased recreation activity. Alternative 1
would provide additional parking at the end of East Venice Drive. With no reduction to current on-street
parking availability and additional parking included in Alternative 1, sufficient parking would be available to
accommodate peak visitation to the study area. This impact would be less than significant.

Construction employees would be required to park in the designated project staging areas (shown in Exhibit 2-5),
which are sized to accommodate the estimated maximum of 76 employees. As a result, there would be no increase
in on-street parking demand during construction.
Based on the assumptions and calculation described above, the existing peak visitation rate of 25–30 visitors per
hour corresponds to a demand for nine to 27 parking spaces, which is currently provided by on-street parking. As
described above in “Methods and Assumptions,” Alternative 1 involves constructing additional public access and
recreational facilities, and thus, implementing Alternative 1 would likely result in an increase in the number of
visitors to the study area and in demand for parking.
The additional demand for parking would be primarily near the western boundary of the study area because the
additional public access and recreation facilities would be primarily in the western portion of the study area, west
of the Upper Truckee River. Alternative 1 would provide additional parking in the western portion of the study
area. Also, the supply of parking would likely be increased near the western boundary of the study area as part of
the joint-use agreement between the Conservancy and the Tahoe Keys Marina. This agreement would allow
visitors to the study area to park in an expanded parking lot at the Tahoe Keys Marina, which would be sufficient
to accommodate the increased peak combined visitation to the study area and the Tahoe Keys Marina.
Although Alternative 1 would construct trails, a viewpoint, and a kiosk near the southern boundary of the study area,
the kiosk would be along an existing bicycle path, and the new trails and viewpoint would be designed to provide
habitat protection. Furthermore, Alternative 1 proposes to remove existing user-created trails from the core habitat
area, thus not substantially increasing overall trails near the southern boundary of the study area. Therefore, near the
southern boundary of the study area, parking demand would remain similar to existing demand.

The bridge over the Upper Truckee River and the boardwalk along the Lake Tahoe shoreline would connect the
eastern portion of the study area to the western portion, and thus, could potentially affect demand for on-street
parking near the study area’s eastern boundary. However, it is expected that much of the use would be by
residents of the Al Tahoe, Highland Woods, and Tahoe Keys neighborhoods and others who currently use the
study area because most of the area is not directly connected with regional transit and is not located along the
primary thoroughfare (U.S. 50). Therefore, near the eastern boundary of the study area, parking demand would
remain similar to existing demand.
In summary, although Alternative 1 would likely increase the number of visitors to the study area, any increase in
parking demand would not be substantial. First, a large portion of visitors would continue to be residents of
adjacent neighborhoods who do not drive to the study area. Second, on-street parking would remain available, as
under existing conditions, to accommodate a large portion of the parking demand. Third, Alternative 1 would
include a small parking lot providing additional parking. Also, because Alternative 1 proposes a paved bike path,
a greater portion of visitors using the area are expected to travel by bicycle, (not automobile) than under existing
conditions. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.16-3
(Alt. 1)

Potential for Conflicts between Construction Traffic, Local Traffic, Pedestrians, and Bicycles (CEQA
6; TRPA 5). Construction under Alternative 1 would add short-term truck traffic on local roads in the project
vicinity. This traffic has the potential to create conflicts with local traffic, pedestrians, and bicyclists.
However, as described in Environmental Commitment 12, the Conservancy would prepare and implement
traffic control plans to ensure the safety of local traffic, pedestrians, and bicycles during construction.
Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

Under Alternative 1, approximately 27 paved parking spaces and regular automobile parking/circulation and
parking access would be added near East Venice Drive. The proposed parking is not expected to create conflicts
between cyclists and automobiles. Local access to the lot would be provided in an area where parking currently
occurs, and signage would be included to direct visitors to parking and trails.
Under Alternative 1, large trucks would be required to travel on local streets between the study area and U.S. 50,
and would need to make several turns. The construction access to the site includes the designated haul routes as
shown in Exhibit 2-5. Other automobiles, pedestrians, or bicyclists present along those streets and at the local
intersections could encounter conflicts with construction trucks. “Conflicts” in this context mean changes to
normal travel behavior in response to encountering construction traffic, such as traveling outside designated lanes,
stopping more quickly than normal, or otherwise maneuvering to avoid a hazard. Along these routes the potential
for conflicts between pedestrians, bicyclists, and trucks would be most acute when large trucks would be
involved. Regular “bobtail” dump trucks would not be expected to create substantial conflicts, but the turning
requirements of large five-axle truck/trailer combinations could create conflicts. Traffic, bicycle, and pedestrian
safety would be at risk where there would be a potential for such conflicts.
As described in Environmental Commitment (EC) 12 (Table 2-6), the Conservancy would prepare traffic control
plans to ensure the safety of local traffic, pedestrians, and bicyclists during construction. The plans would be
prepared sufficiently in advance of project construction to allow adequate review, comment, and concurrence by
the City of South Lake Tahoe public service providers. They could include advance public advisories,
construction-period signage, flag personnel, and other special traffic-control actions as necessary. The following
specific measures could be included in the plans:
►

►

Distribute or mail flyers to residents in the nearby Al Tahoe, Highland Woods, and Tahoe Keys subdivisions
before the beginning of construction, advising them about the upcoming construction traffic.
Place advisory signs along construction routes in advance of construction to alert motorists, pedestrians, and
bicyclists about the upcoming construction traffic.

►

Install signage on designated haul routes in the construction area to inform the public of the presence of
trucks.
Provide flag personnel at when truck activity is heavy (i.e., more than ten trucks per hour).
Provide information to all truck drivers identifying haul routes, speed limits, locations of flaggers, and any
other pertinent public safety information.
Monitor truck and traffic conditions to identify traffic congestion and safety concerns related to truck, vehicle,
and pedestrian and bicycle conflicts, and adjust the management approach as needed.

Because construction traffic controls implemented through the plans would minimize the potential conflicts, this
impact would be less than significant.
Alternative 2: New Channel—West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure)
IMPACT
3.16-1
(Alt. 2)

Increased Traffic on Regional Circulation System during Construction. (CEQA 1, 2; TRPA 4)
Construction of Alternative 2 would add traffic to major roads in the area of the project, but no appreciable
change to current operating levels of service would result from construction. This direct impact would be less
than significant.

The amount of automobile and truck traffic associated with implementation of Alternative 2 would vary
throughout the construction season as different activities occur. No bicycle path would be constructed for
Alternative 2, but habitat restoration would require cut and fill of more material than under Alternative 1. As a
result, Alternative 2 would result in a greater number of external truckloads than under Alternative 1: ten
truckloads per day versus four truckloads per day under Alternative 1 (see Tables 3.16-11 and 3.16-7,
respectively). During the construction period, the truckloads would be hauled on roads through the Al Tahoe and
Highland Woods subdivisions (as shown in Exhibit 2-6). In the Al Tahoe subdivision, trucks would travel on
Lakeview Drive to the Lily Avenue access point, San Francisco Avenue to its access point, and Los Angeles
Avenue to the Bellevue Avenue access point. In the Highland Woods subdivision, trucks would travel on Rubicon
Trail to its access point.
Table 3.16-11 summarizes the traffic characteristics of Alternative 2 regarding construction activities.
Table 3.16-12 summarizes peak-hour and daily trip generation for Alternative 2 on both a vehicle and a PCE
basis.
Table 3.16-13 identifies peak-hour levels of service at study area intersections during the a.m. and p.m. peak
hours during construction activities under Alternative 2. Additive traffic compared to existing 24-hour traffic
volume counts is shown in Table 3.16-14.
Adopted standards identify LOS D as the minimum acceptable level of service at intersections in developed urban
areas. All the study intersections currently operate at an overall level of service of LOS A–LOS C. None of the
study intersections operate at an overall level of service of LOS D–LOS F. The construction-related traffic
operational analysis conducted for this alternative estimates that 86 PCEs would be added during the a.m. and
p.m. peak hours (see Table 3.16-12). The addition of this automobile and truck traffic would not cause any
intersections currently operating at an overall level of service of LOS A–LOS C to operate at an overall level of
service of LOS D–LOS F. At the intersection controlled by side street stop signs, the addition of through traffic on
U.S. 50 resulting from project construction would incrementally increase the length of delays experienced by
motorists waiting to enter the state highway, but project traffic would not change acceptable LOS conditions to
unacceptable conditions. This impact would be less than significant.

IMPACT
3.16-2
(Alt. 2)

Increased Parking Demand. (TRPA 2) Operational parking demand would be expected to be similar to
existing demand because the increase in recreation infrastructure would be minimal. Construction-related
parking demand would be met by employees parking in designated project staging areas, and thus would not
increase demand for parking during construction. A small increase in demand for parking near the western
boundary of the study area could result from operation of Alternative 2. However, no reduction to current onstreet parking availability would occur and additional public parking may also be provided by the joint-use
agreement between the Conservancy and the Tahoe Keys Marina. Because existing parking would be
sufficient to accommodate peak visitation to the study area under Alternative 2, this impact would be less
than significant.

Construction employees would be required to park in the designated project staging areas (shown in Exhibit 2-6),
which are sized to accommodate the estimated maximum of 77 employee trips. As a result, there would be no
increase in on-street parking demand during construction.
Based on the assumptions and calculation described above, the existing peak visitation rate of 25–30 visitors per
hour corresponds to a demand for nine to 27 parking spaces, which is currently provided by on-street parking.
Because Alternative 2 involves constructing fewer public access and recreational facilities, implementation would
likely result in less demand for additional parking spaces than other alternatives. The additional demand for
parking would be near the western boundary of the study area because the additional public access and recreation
facilities would be in the western portion of the study area, west of the Upper Truckee River. On-street parking
would remain available to accommodate parking demand under Alternative 2. Also, the supply of parking would
likely be increased through a joint-use agreement between the Conservancy and the Tahoe Keys Marina, which
would expand marina parking. Because Alternative 2 would involve only small changes in recreation
opportunities, existing on-street parking would be sufficient to accommodate peak combined visitation to the
study area. Thus, this impact would be less than significant.

3.16-3
(Alt. 2)

Potential for Conflicts between Construction Traffic, Local Traffic, Pedestrians, and Bicycles.
(CEQA 6; TRPA 5) Construction under Alternative 2 would add short-term truck traffic on local roads in the
project vicinity. This traffic has the potential to create conflicts with local traffic, pedestrians, and bicyclists.
However, as described in Environmental Commitment 12, the Conservancy would prepare and implement
traffic control plans to ensure the safety of local traffic, pedestrians, and bicycles during construction.
Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

Under Alternative 2, large trucks would be required to travel on local streets between the study area and U.S. 50,
including the need to make several turns. The construction access to the site includes the designated haul routes as
shown in Exhibit 2-6. As under Alternative 1, other automobiles, pedestrians, or bicyclists present along those
streets and at the local intersections could encounter potential conflicts with construction trucks. This potential
would be greater under Alternative 2 than Alternative 1, because the number of truck trips (Table 3.16-11) would
be nearly three times more than under Alternative 1. As described in EC 12 (Table 2-6), the Conservancy would
prepare traffic control plans to ensure the safety of local traffic, pedestrians, and bicyclists during construction.
The plans would be prepared sufficiently in advance of project construction to allow adequate review, comment,
and concurrence by the City of South Lake Tahoe public service providers. Because construction traffic controls
implemented through the plans would minimize the potential conflicts, this impact would be less than

(Alt. 3)

Increased Traffic on Regional Circulation System during Construction. (CEQA 1, 2; TRPA 4) Construction
of Alternative 3 would add traffic to major roads in the area of the project, but no appreciable change to current
operating levels of service would result from construction. This impact would be less than significant.

The amount of automobile and truck traffic associated with construction of Alternative 3 would vary throughout
the construction season as different activities occur. Overall, construction activities would require an average of
four truckloads per day of material hauling (see Table 3.16-15), which would be comparable to Alternative 1 and
less than Alternative 2. During the construction period, the truckloads would be hauled on roads through the Al
Tahoe and Highland Woods subdivisions (as shown in Exhibit 2-7). In the Al Tahoe subdivision, trucks would
travel on Lakeview Drive to the Lily Avenue access point, San Francisco Avenue to its access point, and Los
Angeles Avenue to the Bellevue Avenue access point. In the Highland Woods subdivision, trucks would travel on
Rubicon Trail to its access point.

U.S. 50 resulting from project construction would incrementally increase the length of delays experienced by
motorists waiting to enter the state highway, but project traffic would not change acceptable LOS conditions to
unacceptable conditions. This impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.16-2
(Alt. 3)

Increased Parking Demand. (TRPA 2) Operation of Alternative 3 would increase demand for parking, but
the increase would be less under this alternative than under Alternative 1. Construction employees would
park in designated project staging areas, and thus would not increase demand for parking during
construction. A small increase in demand for parking could result from operation of Alternative 3, near the
western boundary of the study area. However, no reduction to current on-street parking availability would
occur, and on-street parking would continue to be sufficient to accommodate peak visitation to the study
area. Also, additional public parking would likely be provided by a joint-use agreement between the
Conservancy and the Tahoe Keys Marina. This impact would be less than significant.

Construction employees would be required to park in the designated project staging areas (shown in Exhibit 2-7),
which are sized to accommodate the estimated maximum of 68 employees. As a result, there would be no increase
in on-street parking demand during construction.
Based on the assumptions and calculation described above, the existing peak visitation rate of 25–30 visitors per
hour corresponds to a demand for nine to 27 parking spaces. Because Alternative 3 (moderate recreation) involves
constructing less public access and recreational facilities than Alternative 1 and more than Alternative 2,
implementation would likely result in an increase in demand for parking spaces intermediate between Alternative
1 (maximum recreation) and Alternative 2 (minimum recreation).
The additional demand for parking would be primarily near the western boundary of the study area because the
additional public access and recreation facilities would be in the western portion of the study area, west of the
Upper Truckee River. Although Alternative 3 would construct trails and viewpoints near the southern and eastern
boundaries of the study area, these features have been designed to provide core habitat protection and Alternative
3 also would eliminate existing user-created trails within the core habitat; furthermore, it is expected that most of
the use from this area would be localized from within the Al Tahoe, Highland Woods, and Tahoe Keys
neighborhoods because the area is not connected with regional transit and is not located along primary
thoroughfare. Thus, near the southern and eastern boundaries of the study area, parking demand would remain
similar to existing conditions.

On-street parking would remain available, as under existing conditions, to accommodate the demand for parking.
Also, near the western boundary of the study area, the supply of parking would likely be increased, because of the
joint-use agreement between the Conservancy and the Tahoe Keys Marina. This agreement would allow visitors
to the study area to park in an expanded parking lot at the Tahoe Keys Marina, which would be sufficient to
accommodate peak combined visitation to the study area and the Tahoe Keys Marina. This impact would be less
than significant.
IMPACT
3.16-3
(Alt. 3)

Potential for Conflicts between Construction Traffic, Local Traffic, Pedestrians, and Bicycles.
(CEQA 6; TRPA 5) Construction under Alternative 3 would add short-term truck traffic on local roads in the
project vicinity. This traffic has the potential to create conflicts with local traffic, pedestrians, and bicyclists.
However, as described in Environmental Commitment 12, the Conservancy would prepare and implement
traffic control plans to ensure the safety of local traffic, pedestrians, and bicycles during construction.
Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

Under Alternative 3, large trucks would be required to travel on local streets between the study area and U.S. 50,
and would need to make several turns. The construction access to the site includes the designated haul routes as
shown in Exhibit 2-7. As under Alternatives 1 and 2, other automobiles, pedestrians, or bicyclists present along
those streets and at the local intersections could encounter conflicts with construction trucks. Under Alternative 3,
the potential for such conflicts would be similar to Alternative 1 and less than Alternative 2 because the number
of truck trips (Table 3.16-15) would be similar to Alternative 1 and less than under Alternative 2. As described in
EC 12 (Table 2-6), the Conservancy would prepare traffic control plans to ensure the safety of local traffic,
pedestrians, and bicyclists during construction. The plans would be prepared sufficiently in advance of project
construction to allow adequate review, comment, and concurrence by the City of South Lake Tahoe public service
providers. Because construction traffic controls implemented through the plans would minimize the potential
conflicts, this impact would be less than significant.
Alternative 4: Inset Floodplain (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)
IMPACT
3.16-1
(Alt. 4)

Increased Traffic on Regional Circulation System during Construction. (CEQA 1, 2; TRPA 4)
Construction of Alternative 4 would add traffic to major roads in the area of the project, but no appreciable
change to current operating levels of service would result from construction. This impact would be less than
significant.

The amount of automobile and truck traffic associated with implementation of Alternative 4 would vary
throughout the construction season as different activities occur. Overall, construction activities would require an
average of 106 truckloads per day of material hauling, which is substantially more than Alternatives 1–3. Over the
construction period, the truckloads would be hauled on roads through the Al Tahoe and Highland Woods
subdivisions (as shown in Exhibit 2-8). In the Al Tahoe subdivision, trucks would travel on Lakeview Drive to the
Lily Avenue access point, San Francisco Avenue to its access point, and Los Angeles Avenue to the Bellevue
Avenue access point. In the Highland Woods subdivision, trucks would travel on Rubicon Trail to its access
point. Table 3.16-19 summarizes the traffic characteristics of Alternative 4 regarding construction activities. Table
3.16-20 summarizes peak-hour and daily trip generation for Alternative 4 on both a vehicle and a PCE basis.
Table 3.16-21 identifies peak-hour levels of service at study area intersections during the a.m. and p.m. peak
hours during construction activities under Alternative 4. Additive traffic compared to existing 24-hour traffic
volume counts is shown in Table 3.16-22.
Adopted standards identify LOS D as the minimum acceptable level of service at intersections in developed urban
areas. All the study intersections currently operate at an overall level of service of LOS A–LOS C. None of the
study intersections operate at an overall level of service of LOS D–LOS F. The construction-related traffic
operational analysis conducted for this alternative estimates that 121 PCEs would be added during the a.m. and
p.m. peak hours (see Table 3.16-20). The addition of this automobile and truck traffic would not cause any

Code of Ordinances
Regulations in the TRPA Code of Ordinances are applicable to the analysis of utilities provided to the study area:
►

►

Chapter 32, “Basic Services,” establishes requirements for projects to be served by paved roads and water,
electrical, and wastewater treatment services and establishes standards to implement those requirements.
Section 60.3, “Source Water Protection,” sets regulations pertaining to recognition of source water,
prevention of contamination to source water, and protection of public health related to drinking water. It
strengthens provisions of the TRPA Goals and Policies that address groundwater protection, and implements
elements of the TRPA Source Water Protection Program.

City of South Lake Tahoe
The CSLT maintains storm drain facilities in the study area. The CSLT’s Community Development Department
administers the land use policies, which include planning, building, and environmental regulations. The Planning
Division of the Community Development Department also administers various land use regulations through its
code enforcement staff. The CSLT Municipal Code (2012) (City Code) establishes the minimum standards
applicable throughout the city. The City Code includes policies that regulate utilities including electrical,
stormwater, potable water, and wastewater facilities and services. The City Code prohibits illicit connections and
discharges to the stormwater drainage system.
On January 1, 1990, the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (Public Resources Code Section
40000 et seq.), also known as Assembly Bill 939 (AB 939), became law, mandating that every local agency (i.e.,
city or county) divert at least 50 percent of its waste from landfills by the year 2000 or face fines up to $10,000
per day. Since August 2007, South Tahoe Refuse Company has been contracted by the CSLT to provide solid
waste pickup and disposal services for both residential and commercial customers. As of January 2013, South
Lake Tahoe is diverting 66 percent of its waste from landfill (STRR 2013).
The study area lies entirely within the South Tahoe Public Utility District (STPUD) service area for water and
sewer service. STPUD, a public agency formed in 1950, provides wastewater collection, treatment, and recycling
and drinking water to the community of South Lake Tahoe. STPUD has more than 14,000 residential water
connections and 17,000 sewer connections, and operates a treatment plant that has a capacity of 7.7 million
gallons per day and treats 1.8 billion gallons annually (STPUD 2013).

Water Lines
Several potable-water lines exist around the periphery of the study area near the Tahoe Island, Highland Woods,
and Al Tahoe subdivisions. No potable-water lines cross the study area except a water main that is attached to the
north side of the U.S. 50 bridge. Typical coverage over existing buried potable-water lines is four feet.
Sewer System
Several sanitary-sewer lines and manholes exist around the periphery of the study area near the Tahoe Island,
Highland Woods, and Al Tahoe subdivisions. There are two sanitary-sewer crossings in the study area: one on
Trout Creek near River Station 8+00, and one on the Upper Truckee River at approximately River Station 5+00.
The Trout Creek crossing is an active eight-inch-diameter gravity sewer main that serves the Al Tahoe Lift
Station. The Upper Truckee River crossing is an eight-inch-diameter line that was abandoned in place more than
five years ago. The manholes in the floodplain connected to this line are also abandoned.
All of these crossings are below the thalweg (the line connecting the deepest points along a stream) of their
respective alignments. Typical coverage over the existing sanitary sewer lines is six feet in the residential
neighborhoods and three feet within waterway alignments and Stream Environment Zones.
Storm Drain Lines
One existing storm drain line is located within the study area. This line runs from a sump pump located on
Colorado Avenue within the Tahoe Island subdivision, to its outfall along the Upper Truckee River at
approximately River Station 45+50. This pump and line is maintained by the CSLT and is used to relieve
stormwater flooding from Colorado Avenue. Typical coverage over existing storm drain lines is two feet. Existing
storm drain drainage inlets are located on both the north and south sides of the U.S. 50 bridge. These drainage
inlets collect flows from the curb and gutter and discharge directly into the Upper Truckee River from the bridge.
The drainage inlets are surface-mounted grates and incorporated into the bridge structure.
Refuse and Landfills
There are two known locations within the study area where refuse is collected: one at the LWS Restoration Area,
and one at the end of Bellevue Avenue in the Al Tahoe subdivision. Both of these locations have trailhead trash
cans. These trash cans are serviced by the Clean Tahoe Program. The trash cans are serviced an average of three
times per week from May through October, and one time per week during the rest of the year (Lear, pers. comm.,
2008). To comply with state law, refuse generated in the South Lake Tahoe area is taken to a materials recovery
facility located at 2140 Ruth Avenue in South Lake Tahoe, where it is sorted into recyclable components before
disposal. Nonrecyclable, nonhazardous refuse is taken to the Lockwood Regional Landfill, located in Sparks,
Nevada.
South Tahoe Refuse and Recycling Company is permitted to receive 370 tons of waste per day. The current waste
stream is approximately 250 tons per day (Lear, pers. comm., 2008). The Lockwood Regional Landfill is a 21,736acre, unlined landfill that serves all of northern Nevada and much of northern California (Clements, Harmon, and
Young 2007). It is permitted to accept only nonhazardous, municipal (household) waste (NSBDC 2011). This
landfill currently has ten years left on its permit life, and is in the process of seeking an expansion with the Washoe
County Health Department, which is responsible for permitting of the landfill (Lear, pers. comm., 2008).
Electrical, Telephone, and Cable Television Lines
Numerous overhead power, telephone, and cable television lines exist around the periphery of the study area near
the Tahoe Keys, Tahoe Island, Highland Woods, and Al Tahoe subdivisions. These overhead utilities are typical

for the Tahoe Basin. No overhead utility line crossings and poles exist within the study area except lines that run
on both sides of U.S. 50.
Natural Gas Lines
Several natural gas lines exist around the periphery of the study area near the Tahoe Island, Highland Woods, and
Al Tahoe subdivisions. Natural gas lines cross within the study area, and a gas main is attached to the south side
of the U.S. 50 bridge. Typical coverage over existing buried natural gas lines is three feet.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA
Below are outlined the significance criteria for CEQA, NEPA and TRPA. Each agency assigns significance to
their criteria in different ways. For this document, an impact is considered to be a physical change in the
environment and is considered significant under TRPA and CEQA and adverse under NEPA, if the following
occur:
CEQA Criteria
Under CEQA, an alternative was determined to result in a significant effect related to utilities if it would:
►

►

►

►

►

►

►

exceed wastewater treatment requirements of the applicable regional water quality control board (CEQA 1);
require or result in the construction of new water or wastewater treatment facilities or expansion of existing
facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental effects (CEQA 2);
require or result in the construction of new stormwater drainage facilities or expansion of existing facilities,
the construction of which could cause significant environmental effects (CEQA 3);
have insufficient water supplies available to serve the Project from existing entitlements and resources, or
require new or expanded water supply resources or entitlements (CEQA 4);
result in a determination by the wastewater treatment provider which serves or may serve the Project that it
has inadequate capacity to serve the Project’s projected demand in addition to the provider’s existing
commitments (CEQA 5);
require solid waste disposal services from a landfill with insufficient permitted capacity to accommodate the
Project’s expected solid waste disposal needs (CEQA 6); or
be out of compliance with Federal, state, and local statutes and regulations related to solid waste (CEQA 7).

NEPA Criteria
An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the
environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the proposed action. Under NEPA, the significance
of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account
under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are
encompassed by the CEQA criteria used for this analysis.

TRPA Criteria
Based on TRPA’s Initial Environmental Checklist, an alternative would result in a significant impact for utilities
if it would result in any of the following:
►

Except for planned improvements, will the proposal result in a need for:
•

Power or natural gas (TRPA 1);

•

Communication systems (TRPA 2);

•

Utilize additional water which amount will exceed the maximum permitted capacity of the service
provider (TRPA 3);

•

Utilize additional sewage treatment capacity which amount will exceed the maximum permitted capacity
of the sewage treatment provider (TRPA 4);

•

Storm water drainage(TRPA 5); or

•

Solid waste and disposal (TRPA 6).

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
Utilities and services data for the study area, the City of South Lake Tahoe, and other cities in the region were
obtained from comprehensive plans and associated environmental documents, urban water management plans,
capital improvement plans, and the service providers. The locations and conditions of local water supply, storm
drainage, sanitary sewer, and solid waste were identified.

EFFECTS NOT DISCUSSED FURTHER IN THIS EIR/EIS/EIS
Exceed wastewater treatment requirements (CEQA 1; TRPA 4) – None of the alternatives would include
development of any facilities which would generate wastewater which would be sent to the public wastewater
system. Any sanitary facilities required during or after construction would be portable toilets or bathrooms with
vaults. Sanitary waste would be periodically removed by a private waste hauler.
Require or result in the construction of new or expanded water or wastewater treatment facilities (CEQA
2, 5; TRPA 4) – No alternatives would require permanent use of public water supplies or wastewater facilities.
Therefore, there is no potential to cause construction of new or expanded facilities.
Require or result in the construction of new stormwater drainage facilities (CEQA 3, TRPA 5) –
Alternatives 1–4 would include restoration elements to improve ecosystem functions within the study area,
including hydrologic processes. The proposed public access and recreation infrastructure elements are designed to
appropriately manage any increased surface runoff through infiltration (i.e., not requiring the construction of any
new public stormwater collection or treatment facilities). Alternatives 2 and 3 also provide available area for the
development of stormwater treatment areas. These areas are not proposed to manage stormwater generated by the
project but provide a benefit for the treatment of stormwater generated outside the project area.
Have insufficient available water supplies (CEQA 4, TRPA 3) – The project would not, under any of the
alternatives, result in the demand for a permanent water supply. No water would be supplied to proposed
recreational facilities. During construction, periodic temporary use of public water supplies may be required (i.e.,
use of fire hydrants) and would be arranged under agreements with STPUD.

Utilities

Result in the need for power or gas during construction (TRPA 1 in part) – The project would require
temporary use of power during construction. For Alternatives 1, 2, 3, and 4, the use of electricity (provided by
Liberty Energy) would be limited to power necessary for a construction trailer and security lighting. This use
would not be significant. No use of natural gas is expected.
Result in the need for communications during construction (TRPA 2) – The primary communication system
would likely be cell phones. It is possible that the project could require a temporary phone line for the
construction trailer. This use would be short term and have a negligible effect on existing communication
systems.

IMPACT ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
Alternative 1: Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)
IMPACT
3.17-1
(Alt. 1)

Increased Waste Disposal Requirements Resulting from Construction and Operations (CEQA 6,
TRPA 6). Implementing Alternative 1 would entail construction activities and operations that would generate
solid waste. The quantity of solid waste would be very small relative to the existing solid waste generation from
the population in the City of South Lake Tahoe and nearby communities, and the facility providing waste
disposal services has sufficient capacity. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

During construction, any trees or other vegetation removed would be reused (either replanted or mulched) within
the study area. However, construction activities could potentially contribute to a temporary or short-term increase
in solid waste generation. For any of these alternatives, the increased demand on solid waste generation resulting
from construction would be small relative to the existing waste generation from the population in the City of
South Lake Tahoe and nearby communities. Lockwood Landfill provides waste disposal services for the
community and has adequate capacity. Thus, the construction-related effects of implementing Alternative 1 would
be insubstantial.
During operation, Alternative 1 would result in a small increase in solid waste generation resulting from an
increase in recreational use. Currently, South Tahoe Refuse collects solid waste from the site. To comply with
state law, all recyclable waste is recycled and only non-recyclable waste is taken to the Lockwood Landfill, which
has adequate capacity. (It currently has 10 years left on its permit life, and has been seeking an expansion with the
Washoe County Health Department, which is responsible for permitting of the landfill [Lear, pers. comm., 2008].)
Increased solid waste generation resulting from operation of Alternative 1 would be small relative to the existing
waste generation from the population in the City of South Lake Tahoe and nearby communities, and would have
similar recycling and waste diversion requirements. The increase in solid waste from operation of Alternative 1
would not have a substantial effect. Because the temporary, short-term, and long-term effects of implementing
Alternative 1 would be very small and the landfill providing waste disposal services has adequate capacity, this
impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.17-2
(Alt. 1)

Increased Use of Electrical Power (TRPA 1). Implementing Alternative 1 would include construction of a
parking lot, which would require permanent lighting. The use of power could be considerable if the lighting
system is not properly designed and maintained. Because the final design of the alternative would include a
low-energy parking lot lighting system, this impact would be less than significant.

Alternative 1 includes the construction of a permanent parking lot off of East Venice Drive. For safety, the lot
would have a permanent lighting system. Lighting parking areas can require significant use of electricity. At the
current level of design, the lighting system has not been specified. Conventional street lighting systems can draw
up to 500 to 1,000 watts per hour. The final design of the alternative will include a low-energy parking lot lighting
system and include low wattage lights such as light emitting diode (LED) lamps and, if feasible, be solarpowered. This impact would be less than significant.

3.18 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
This section analyzes the overall cumulative impacts of the project alternatives and the No-Project/No-Action
Alternative, taken together with other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects producing related
impacts, as required by the State CEQA Guidelines (14 California Code of Regulations [CCR] Section 15130)
and NEPA implementing regulations (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 1508.7).
This analysis follows applicable guidance provided by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) in
Considering Cumulative Effects under the National Environmental Policy Act (CEQ 1997) and Guidance on the
Consideration of Past Actions in Cumulative Effects Analysis (CEQ 2005). The analysis also follows applicable
guidance and directives provided by Reclamation in the public review draft of Reclamation’s NEPA Handbook
(2000). The latter guidance is used informally in this analysis because the NEPA Handbook is currently being
revised.

3.18.1

DEFINITIONS OF CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

NEPA DEFINITION OF CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
The CEQ regulations that implement provisions of NEPA define cumulative impacts as “the impact on the
environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (federal or non-federal) or person undertakes such
other actions” (40 CFR 1508.7).
Cumulative effects can result from individually minor, but collectively significant, actions over time and differ
from indirect impacts (40 CFR 1508.8). They are caused by the incremental increase in total environmental
effects when the evaluated project is added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions. Thus,
cumulative impacts can arise from causes that are totally unrelated to the project being evaluated, and the analysis
of cumulative impacts looks at the life cycle of the effects, not the project at issue. These impacts can be either
adverse or beneficial.
For this analysis, adverse cumulative impacts are analyzed separately from beneficial cumulative impacts, and
significance conclusions are made only for adverse cumulative impacts.

TRPA DEFINITION OF CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
TRPA has not established a definition of cumulative impacts. Rather, TRPA applies NEPA and CEQA definitions
of cumulative impacts to its impact assessments.

CEQA DEFINITION OF CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
Cumulative impacts are defined in the State CEQA Guidelines (CCR Section 15355) as “two or more individual
effects which, when considered together, are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental
impacts.” A cumulative impact occurs from “the change in the environment which results from the incremental
impact of the project when added to other closely related past, present, and reasonably foreseeable probable future
projects. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant projects taking place
over a period of time” (CCR Section 15355(b)).
Consistent with the State CEQA Guidelines (CCR Section 15130(a)), the discussion of cumulative impacts in this
section focuses on significant and potentially significant cumulative impacts. The State CEQA Guidelines (CCR
Section 15130(b)) state that:

3.18-1

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Cumulative Impacts

The discussion of cumulative impacts shall reflect the severity of the impacts and their likelihood of
occurrence, but the discussion need not provide as great detail as is provided for the effects attributable to
the project alone. The discussion should be guided by the standards of practicality and reasonableness,
and should focus on the cumulative impact to which the identified other projects contribute rather than the
attributes of other projects which do not contribute to the cumulative impact.

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS OF ANALYSIS
NEPA guidelines do not provide specific guidance on how to conduct a cumulative impact analysis; however,
Reclamation’s draft NEPA Handbook states that an EIS should identify associated actions (past, present, or
future) that, when viewed with the proposed or alternative actions, may have significant cumulative impacts.
Cumulative impacts should not be speculative, but should be based on known long-range plans, regulations, or
operating agreements.
The State CEQA Guidelines identify two basic methods for establishing the cumulative environment in which the
project is to be considered: the use of a list of past, present, and probable future projects (the “list approach”) or
the use of adopted projections from a general plan, other regional planning document, or certified EIR for such a
planning document (the “plan approach”). For this cumulative impact analysis, the list approach has been
followed to generate the most reliable future projections possible. To analyze the cumulative impacts of the Upper
Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project’s action alternatives, a list of related past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable future projects was compiled, and the combined effects of these projects and each action alternative
were evaluated by resource topic.
Significance Criteria
When considering cumulative impacts of the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project, the
environmental consequences of project-related actions were evaluated, using the criteria in Appendix G of the
CEQA checklist, to determine whether implementing such actions would make a cumulatively considerable
contribution to a significant cumulative impact. “Cumulatively considerable” means that the incremental effects
of an individual project are significant when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, the effects of
other projects, and the effects of probable future projects (State CEQA Guidelines, Section 15065[a][3]). Thus,
the effects of project actions were evaluated in combination with the effects of other past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable future actions to determine whether (1) the overall cumulative impact would be significant and (2) the
actions would considerably contribute to that overall cumulative impact. Both circumstances must exist to
conclude that an environmental consequence would be cumulatively significant. Cumulatively significant effects
would do any of the following:
►

►

►

cause a significant adverse impact on a resource (using the criteria for significance described in Chapter 3,
“Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences”);
make a considerable contribution to an already degraded or declining resource that has experienced
substantial adverse effects from other past, present, or reasonably foreseeable future projects; or
cause an effect that was initially not significant by itself, but that would be part of a cumulatively degrading
or declining future trend resulting from other reasonably foreseeable future actions.

A project’s potential cumulative impacts that would be significant based on the criteria above may be reduced to a
less-than-significant level if the project would comply with the requirements of an approved plan or mitigation
program designed to reduce the project’s potential incremental contribution to a cumulative effect to a level that is
not cumulatively considerable. The approved plan or mitigation program must contain specific requirements that,
if implemented, would avoid or substantially lessen the cumulative problem within the geographic area where the
project would occur.
Short-Term and Long-Term Cumulative Impacts
Because the project involves restoring natural functions and values to a river and marsh through construction
activity, short-term impacts may result from construction-related disturbance. Therefore, the analysis needs to
examine whether short-term cumulative impacts may be caused by implementation of a combination of the Upper
UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

3.18-3

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Cumulative Impacts

Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project and other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects
in the watershed.
Short-term impacts include both effects that would be transient and are related to construction activities (e.g.,
noise) and effects that would last for three to five years and are related to the restoration that would occur after
completion of construction. The restoration period is a transitional time after construction when plant growth and
other natural processes revegetate exposed soils, reestablish wildlife habitats or develop them for the first time,
and stabilize river channels. The relevant time period for the analysis of short-term cumulative impacts, therefore,
is the duration of the project’s construction phase and up to five years thereafter.
In this cumulative impact analysis, short-term impacts are addressed separately from long-term impacts.
Typically, such transitory effects do not result in a cumulatively significant impact, because they do not add to the
effects of other actions. However, the construction and transitional periods of the Upper Truckee River and Marsh
Restoration Project could be concurrent with the construction and transitional periods of several other restoration
and erosion control actions in the Upper Truckee River watershed (Table 3.18-2). Thus, the combined short-term
effects of these restoration and related actions (including the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project)
could be cumulatively significant for certain resources (e.g., water quality), and therefore are discussed in this
section. Also, the short-term effects on a resource could be adverse, while long-term effects on the same resource
would be beneficial. (For example, the short-term risk of construction-period sedimentation could be adverse,
even though the project would fulfill its purpose of creating long-term benefits to water quality.) For these
reasons, short-term cumulative impacts are distinguished from long-term impacts in the cumulative impact
analysis and conclusions.
Long-term cumulative impacts are the more common subject of cumulative impact analysis. Adverse effects
typically accumulate over time as a combination of projects is implemented. Because this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
examines a proposed restoration project, long-term cumulative environmental effects could be either adverse or
beneficial; both types of effects are considered in this analysis. Long-term cumulative impacts are discussed for
each resource after short-term cumulative impacts, if both apply.
Mitigation Measures for Cumulative Impacts
Where a considerable contribution to a significant cumulative adverse effect is identified, mitigation measures are
presented, where feasible. If mitigation for project-related impacts described in Sections 3.2 through 3.17 would
also resolve cumulative impacts, it is cross-referenced in the discussion below. If a new mitigation measure is
needed for the cumulative impact, it is described in its entirety in the following discussion.

RELATED PROJECTS CONSIDERED IN THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT ANALYSIS
Past Projects
The Upper Truckee River, its watershed, and surrounding areas have been substantially altered by land use
practices during the past 150 years. The opening of the Comstock silver mining boom in Nevada in mid-1859
prompted a surge in timber harvesting, and agricultural and developed land uses also increased. From the 1900s to
the present, developed land uses have continued to increase, particularly since 1960. For example, the population
of the city of South Lake Tahoe has increased five-fold since 1960 (CSLT 2003).
As a result of these changes in land use, the Upper Truckee River watershed has experienced ecosystem
degradation that is typical of what has occurred elsewhere in the Tahoe Basin (Murphy and Knopp 2000). The
river has been modified from its original conditions by human activities such as logging, livestock grazing, and
road construction, and by residential, commercial, and industrial developments (including the Lake Tahoe Airport
and U.S. 50 bridge). Many of these past actions continue to affect resources in the project vicinity and Upper

Truckee River watershed, and along the south shore of Lake Tahoe. These major past actions include the
following:

Historic Timber Harvests. Most forests within the watershed of the Upper Truckee River have been grazed
and logged during the past 150 years, and an associated network of skid trails, flumes, logging roads, and
railroads has been constructed during that time (Murphy and Knopp 2000). This extensive grazing, logging,
and road construction altered biologic, hydrologic, geomorphic, and other resources in the Upper Truckee
River watershed, including the project vicinity. Some logging occurred in the study area, and the study area
was grazed for more than 100 years beginning in the 1860s (Lindström 1995, 1996). Both this grazing and the
network of water impounding and diverting dams, gates, and miscellaneous earthen works affected resources
in the study area and adjacent areas.
Fire Suppression. Before the late 1800s, fires were frequent in the Tahoe Basin, and were mostly of low to
moderate intensity. Since that time, changes in land use and fire management have altered the frequency and
intensity of fires. In particular, since about the 1920s, fire suppression has resulted in a several-fold increase
in tree density and fuel loads in most forests in the Tahoe Basin (Barbour et al. 2002:461–462). These
changes in forest structure have altered biological habitats and increased the frequency of high-intensity fires
and the vulnerability of trees to insect outbreaks.
Species Introductions. Nonnative species have been accidentally or deliberately introduced into the aquatic
and terrestrial ecosystems of the Tahoe Basin. Species that have become particularly abundant and are present
in the project vicinity include cowbird (Molothrus ater), beaver (Castor canadensis), brown trout (Salmo
trutta), brown bullhead catfish (Ictalurus nebulosus), cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), and Eurasian milfoil
(Myriophyllum spicatum) (Conservancy and DGS 2003). These species have been altering the resources of the
project vicinity, the Upper Truckee River watershed, and the south shore of Lake Tahoe.
Urban Development. During the past 150 years, a portion of the watershed of the Upper Truckee River has
been converted to developed land uses. Based on a review of land cover within the watershed (using
geographic information system [GIS] data layers from CAL FIRE 2002 and California Interagency Watershed
Mapping Committee 2004), this portion is about 9 percent, concentrated in the lower elevation areas of the
watershed, and includes much of the project vicinity. Urban development has been altering hydrologic,
geomorphic, and other resources within the Upper Truckee River watershed, including the project vicinity.
Several development projects along the Upper Truckee River have adversely affected geomorphic processes,
water quality, and habitats: the golf course at the Lake Valley State Recreation Area (SRA), the South Lake
Tahoe Airport, U.S. 50, and the Tahoe Keys Marina and residential area. (In particular, construction of the
Tahoe Keys Marina and Tahoe Keys residential area has substantially affected resources in the project
vicinity, as described separately below.)
Newlands Project—Tahoe City Dam. Since 1870, a dam has been operated at Tahoe City to regulate the flow
of water from Lake Tahoe into the Lower Truckee River. After enactment of the Reclamation Act of 1902,
the Secretary of the Interior authorized construction of the Newlands Project, and during 1909–1913, the dam
at Tahoe City was reconstructed to its present configuration. This dam controls the top 6.1 feet of storage at
Lake Tahoe as a federal reservoir. The Truckee River Operating Agreement governs the operation of this
dam, and consequently the surface elevation of Lake Tahoe (Reclamation 2008), which has a substantial
effect on the resources of the study area.
Tahoe Keys Marina and Tahoe Keys Residential Area. From the late 1950s into the 1970s, construction of the
Tahoe Keys Marina and the Tahoe Keys residential area substantially altered the Upper Truckee Marsh and
the downstream reach of the Upper Truckee River. During this time, approximately 500 acres in the center of
the marsh was excavated to create canals and the Tahoe Keys Marina, and fill was placed to create the
housing pads of the Tahoe Keys residential area. This project fragmented the marsh into what is now known
as Pope Marsh on the west and the Upper Truckee Marsh on the east. In addition, by 1965, the adjacent

portion of the Upper Truckee River was channelized, which effectively disconnected it from its former
floodplain (Conservancy and DGS 2003).

Heavenly Mountain Resort Master Plan This plan by Vail Resorts, Inc. guided improvement, expansion, and
management of facilities and uses at Heavenly Mountain Resort, including areas within the Cold Creek
watershed (which is within the Trout Creek watershed) (Vail Resorts 2007). Phase I projects included
replacing ski lifts and regrading ski trails; constructing a 1,000-seat restaurant, a bridge for skiers, and new ski
trails; and constructing other facilities. The project involved construction activities (e.g., installing trail, road,
and pipeline crossings) in the channel of perennial waterways.
Lower West Side Wetland Restoration Project. During the summers of 2001 and 2002, approximately 12
acres of former wetland that was filled during Tahoe Keys construction was excavated three to five feet, and
subsequently restored as wetland and reconnected to the Upper Truckee River as part of the active floodplain.
The Lower West Side Wetland Restoration Project area is located next to Tahoe Keys Marina behind Cove
East Beach, west of the river.
Angora Creek Restoration Projects. Two restoration projects were completed by the California Department of
Parks and Recreation (DPR) on Angora Creek, in 1997 and 2002:
•

A reach of Angora Creek that flows through the study area was restored in 1997. That reach was
channelized and diverted to dry the meadow for grazing. The Lake Tahoe Golf Course was later built over
part of this meadow and abandoned channel. Both reaches were restored, building a new, more sinuous
channel reconnected to the meadow floodplain. The objective of both projects was to decrease erosion,
enhance wetland and riparian habitat, and improve water quality by restoring the stream channel to a
geomorphically functioning condition. Restoring the bed elevation and sinuosity of the stream restored
access to the meadow floodplain, raised groundwater elevations, increased sediment deposition and
nutrient removal, and improved meadow health.

•

In 2002, DPR restored a second reach of Angora Creek, as well as the adjacent meadow. A section of
Angora Creek once meandered through a wet meadow, but the stream was captured by the South Tahoe
Public Utility District’s sewer alignment in the 1960s. The stream deviated from its original winding path
over the sewer, giving the stream more power and causing an increase in erosive forces. The channel had
down-cut, scouring the bed of the stream to two feet below its original elevation. This in turn caused the
meadow to dry out and degraded critical habitat.

Angora Fisheries and Water Quality Project. This project, completed in 2010 by the Conservancy, El Dorado
County, and Reclamation, is located in the watershed of the Upper Truckee River at the Angora Creek
crossing of Lake Tahoe Boulevard (El Dorado County DOT 2006). The project involved modifying Angora
Creek near the culverts under Lake Tahoe Boulevard to improve fish passage. As part of these modifications,
fill was removed in the Stream Environment Zone (SEZ) and the existing culverts were replaced. Angora
Creek was dewatered and isolated while the culverts were replaced.
Upper Truckee Middle Reaches 3 and 4 Restoration Project. This project was implemented by the CSLT with
funding from the Conservancy and Reclamation and completed in 2011. The project is located along the
Upper Truckee River from roughly 0.5 mile northeast of the northern runway limit of the Lake Tahoe Airport
to approximately the midpoint of the runway (Reclamation, CSLT, and TRPA 2008). The objectives were to
restore natural river and floodplain processes by increasing overbank flow and depositing sediment onto the
floodplain, and to improve habitat for terrestrial and aquatic wildlife. To accomplish these objectives, a new
channel (approximately 4,000 feet long) was constructed and revegetated and the abandoned channel was
backfilled and revegetated. A new floodplain was constructed by removing existing fill. Construction of this
new channel and floodplain entailed constructing a temporary river crossing, removing and stockpiling
approximately 52,000 cubic yards of soil, and removing and stockpiling a large amount of plant materials.

Additionally, three fish barriers were removed and three in-channel habitat structures were constructed. The
total area of disturbance associated with this project was approximately 28 acres.

Trout Creek Restoration Project. Trout Creek is a tributary to the Upper Truckee River, reaching the
confluence within the study area. Geomorphic problems with Trout Creek stem from channelization of the
lower portions of this stream during construction of a 19th-century railroad route. The straightened channel
produced an incised and eroded bed, sand and sediment deposition, and degraded aquatic and riparian habitat
conditions. As a part of efforts to control sediment delivery into Lake Tahoe and stabilize stream channels in
the watershed, a restoration project began on Trout Creek to reconstruct natural channel sinuosity, pool-riffle
sequences, substrate composition, bank stability, and hydrologic function. The project site was located on
lower Trout Creek meadows, above and below the confluence with Cold Creek. Restoration of the upper
channelized section of stream (above Cold Creek) to control erosion and stabilize the channel involved
completely replacing this upstream reach with an adjacent reconstructed sinuous channel. The channel and
bank of the downstream reach (below Cold Creek) was only partly reconfigured, interspersed with existing
channel forms where natural sinuosity occurred. The reconstruction project was completed during 2000–2001,
with flow of the creek redirected into the new channels in summer 2001 (Herbst 2009:2–3).
Lake Tahoe Airport Runway Restoration Project. This project by the CSLT was located at the South Lake
Tahoe Airport adjacent to the Upper Truckee River. Along the existing runway, the CSLT removed a 25-footwide by 1,300-foot-long area of impervious surface and replaced a portion of this area with pervious concrete.
Fill within the SEZ of the Upper Truckee River was removed and the area revegetated. The project did not
involve activities within the channel of the Upper Truckee River or any perennial tributaries of the river. The
project was completed in 2010.
Multi-Agency Erosion Control Projects. Multiple agencies have completed erosion control projects
throughout the Upper Truckee River watershed and elsewhere in the Tahoe Basin to restore the clarity of
Lake Tahoe. Most projects addressed erosion control and source runoff improvements, as well as the
implementation of best management practices (BMPs) to capture fine sediment and other pollutants before
they reach the lake. Erosion control projects and advance treatment methods are implemented to reduce both
the volume of water running off roadways and the amount of fine sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus
discharging into Lake Tahoe. El Dorado County, the Conservancy, TRPA, Caltrans, CSLT, and the U.S.
Forest Service (USFS) have implemented erosion control measures along Angora Creek, U.S. 50, North
Upper Truckee Road, Al Tahoe neighborhood, and other roadways, including forest roads and trails.
Measures include redesign and replacement of inadequately sized culverts, inlets, and outfalls; revegetation
and other source control measures on eroding slopes; and installation of curbs and gutters, rock bowls at
culvert outlets, vegetated swales, and sediment traps and other BMPs. Specific project examples in the Upper
Truckee River watershed include El Dorado SR 89, Segment 1–Luther Pass to Meyers Water Quality
Improvement Project, Apalachee 3B–Water Quality Project, and U.S. 50 Caltrans Water Quality Projects.
Sawmill 1B Bike Trail Project—Air Quality and Recreation Access. This project by El Dorado County, with
funding from the Conservancy and TRPA, is located along U.S. 50 from the entrance to the Lake Tahoe Golf
Course to Sawmill Road (Ferry, pers. comm., 2007). It provides a bike trail across the project area. This
project involved some construction activities in the channel of waterways (e.g., footings and abutments of
crossings). Construction was completed in 2010.
Riparian Hardwoods Restoration and Enhancement Description. This project by DPR was completed in 2011
in selected areas of DPR properties, including Washoe Meadows State Park and Lake Valley State Recreation
Area. It involved removing lodgepole pines from areas of aspen, willow, and alder along the maintenance
road adjacent to the Upper Truckee River upstream of the golf course (DPR and Reclamation 2007). The
project did not involve construction activities in the channel of a perennial waterway.

Present and Reasonably Foreseeable Projects
Present and reasonably foreseeable, probable future projects are those projects that are currently under
construction, approved for construction, or in various stages of formal planning. Some of these projects are
planned to be under construction during the period when this project is expected to be constructed (2015–2018).
The present or reasonably foreseeable, probable future projects considered in this cumulative analysis are those
projects that are located within the Upper Truckee River watershed and the south shore area of the Tahoe Basin
and that have been identified as potentially affecting resources that also may be affected by the Upper Truckee
River and Marsh Restoration Project. Table 3.18-2 lists these related projects. A preliminary list of projects was
compiled by reviewing available information regarding planned projects (including agency Web sites), and by
contacting staff members from the CSLT, the Conservancy, El Dorado County, Lake Valley Fire Protection
District, DPR, TRPA, and USFS. Projects were then reviewed for inclusion in the cumulative impact analysis
based on three criteria:
(1) The project is reasonably foreseeable because it has an identified sponsor and has initiated CEQA, TRPA,
and/or NEPA environmental review or other regulatory procedures.
(2) Available information defines the project in sufficient detail to allow meaningful analysis.
(3) The project could affect resources potentially affected by the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration
Project.
Identified projects that satisfied these three criteria have been organized into the following three categories:
(1) river and stream restoration,
(2) water quality and erosion control, and
(3) other projects.
The projects within each of these categories are listed in Table 3.18-2.

Description: This project proposed by the Conservancy and the USFS would be located in a 739-acre
Sunset Stables
Restoration Project Management Planning Area in the vicinity of the South Lake Tahoe Airport, and adjacent to and
directly south of the Upper Truckee Middle Reaches 3 and 4 Restoration Project (Conservancy and
DGS 2008a). Its goals include restoring a more naturally functioning river and floodplain, improving
water quality by restoring floodplain processes, and reducing erosion from bank failure. The project
would restore, enhance, and protect aquatic and terrestrial habitat diversity and quality and provide for
appropriate and compatible public access. To accomplish these goals, it would restore a portion of the
2.6-mile-long reach of the Upper Truckee River that is in the Management Planning Area. This new
channel would start east of the U.S. 50 bridge and would be designed around existing sewer and water
pipelines to the extent possible. Lateral grade controls would be installed where the new channel
crosses the old channel, and vertical grade controls would be installed where the new channel
transitions to existing channel. Implementation would entail excavating new channels, and after the
new channels have been revegetated, diverting the river’s flow into the new channel(s) and filling and
revegetating the abandoned channel.

Reaches 1 and 2
Stream Restoration
Project

Description: This project led by the Conservancy and the USFS would be located from U.S. 50
upstream to the vicinity of the South Lake Tahoe Airport, and just downstream of the Upper Truckee
Middle Reaches 3 and 4 Restoration Project. The objectives of the Upper Truckee Middle Reaches 1
and 2 Stream Restoration Project are to (1) eliminate a gully that is eroding along the river at this site,
and (2) enhance aquatic and adjacent terrestrial habitat along the Upper Truckee River. To accomplish
these objectives, the gully channel would be filled and revegetated, and portions of the channel banks
of the Upper Truckee River would be recontoured and revegetated. Some riparian enhancements, bank
stabilization, and aquatic habitat structures are also being considered (Carroll, pers. comm., 2008).
Status: Currently the project is on hold while the USFS proceeds through the federal land acquisition
process with the intention of acquiring the property by 2013. The environmental document (IS/MND
and EA/FONSI) is being developed. Construction could begin in 2014 and would last for 1 season,
with only irrigation anticipated in subsequent seasons.

Upper Truckee
River Restoration
and Golf Course
Reconfiguration
Project

Description: This DPR, TRPA, and Reclamation project would occur in the Upper Truckee River
watershed at Washoe Meadows SP and Lake Valley SRA. The purpose of the project is to improve
geomorphic processes, ecological functions, and habitat values of a 1.5-mile reach of the Upper
Truckee River, helping to reduce the river’s discharge of nutrients and sediment that diminish Lake
Tahoe’s clarity while providing access to public recreation opportunities in Washoe Meadows SP and
Lake Valley SRA. Four alternative approaches to implementing the proposed project are being
considered, along with the No-Project/No-Action Alternative. Depending on which alternative is
selected, the proposed restoration project may include continuing existing golf course use, removing
the entire Lake Tahoe Golf Course, or reconfiguring the golf course to allow for restoration of the
river, reduce the area of SEZ occupied by the golf course, and allow for establishment of a buffer area
between the golf course and the river.
The four action alternatives (Alternatives 2–5) and the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative
1) are analyzed in the draft EIR/EIS/EIS. Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative, Alternative 1,
the river restoration and changes to the golf course would not be implemented. This alternative
represents a projection of reasonably foreseeable future conditions that could occur if no project
actions were implemented. Alternative 2 would involve restoring the Upper Truckee River and
providing a reconfigured 18-hole regulation golf course. Alternative 3 would involve restoring the
river and providing a reduced-play golf course. Alternative 4 would use a combination of hard and
soft stabilization to keep the river in its present configuration and would involve only minor changes
to the existing golf course. Alternative 5 would involve decommissioning and removing the 18-hole
regulation golf course to restore all or a portion of the golf course landscape to meadow and riparian
habitat.
Status: An EIR/EIS/EIS is currently being prepared for the project. Construction could begin in 2014,
and would last for three to four years (with most in-channel work occurring during one season).

Project

Description: This project by USFS would be located on 1,790 acres in the upper Cold Creek
watershed, which is part of the Trout Creek watershed (USFS 2008a). Its purpose includes guiding
management of the property, restoring the channel of Cold Creek through the High Meadow Complex
to increase water and sediment storage and to allow it to function as a wet meadow ecosystem, and to
provide for current and future recreation needs and reduce the impacts associated with recreation. The
project could include creation of approximately 8,700 feet of new channels and associated floodplain
on the mainstem, East Fork, and North Fork of Cold Creek; removal and fill of diversion ditches;
removal of lodgepole pines; rerouting and decommissioning of roads and trails; and redesign of
stream crossings by roads and trails to reduce effects on aquatic ecosystems.
Status: The project is to be completed in 2012.

Control Project
area, and it would install appropriate BMPs to reduce erosion and nutrient loading and increase
treatment of stormwater runoff from existing impervious surfaces in the project area. This project
would include construction activities in the channel of perennial waterways, which would be
dewatered during construction.
Status: Environmental review is complete and Phase 1 was completed in 2012 and Phase 2 is
scheduled to be completed in 2013.
Other Projects
US50/Stateline
Corridor Project

The USFS partnering with the Federal Highway Administration, CSLT, TRPA, Nevada Department
of Transportation, and California Department of Transportation are evaluating alternatives for the
US50/Stateline Corridor Project. As identified in TRPA Environmental Improvement Program (EIP),
recommended alternatives include water quality, intersection, roadway, pedestrian, bicycle, air, and
scenic improvements. Several other projects identified in the EIP will be implemented as a packaged
project. US-50 is the principal highway into South Lake Tahoe. Entering the Basin west of Echo
Summit, it continues through the South Shore, crosses Stateline, continues to the East Shore, and exits
the Basin at Spooner Summit. A major portion of traffic enters the Lake Tahoe Basin through this
route, and traffic volumes are predicted to increase 27% over the next 20 years. Traffic delay has a
major effect on the Lake environment including impacts to air quality, and pedestrian, bicycle, transit,
and vehicle travel.
Status: The Draft EIR/EIS is currently being prepared.

Description: This project by the Conservancy, El Dorado County, and USFS would be located in the
watershed of the Upper Truckee River in a corridor along Lake Tahoe Boulevard from Tahoe
Mountain Road to the CSLT. It would involve constructing a 2-mile-long bike trail along the road and
implementing erosion control measures. The project would not involve construction activities in the
channel of a perennial waterway.
Status: Environmental review is in process. Construction could begin in 2014 and could continue for
two years.

Multi-Agency Fuel
Reduction Plan

Description: This plan is a multiagency strategy for coordinating implementation of fuel reduction
treatments in the Tahoe Basin (USFS et al. 2007). Treatment types (i.e., general prescriptions) include
community defensible space–wildland urban interface, urban core, defense zone, and general forest
prescriptions. All of these prescriptions reduce surface and ladder fuels, and tree density, to reduce
flame lengths and the likelihood of crown fire. Treatment methodologies include thinning, pruning,
prescribed burning, and masticating and chipping. The strategy identifies a substantial portion of the
Upper Truckee River watershed as priority areas for treatment. These treatments would not involve
construction activities in the channel of perennial waterways.
Status: Fuel reduction treatments are ongoing and the plan identifies priority areas for treatment
during the next five and ten years.

Angora Fire
Restoration and
Redevelopment

Description: Much of the Tahoe Mountain/North Upper Truckee neighborhood is being redeveloped
after the Angora Fire in the summer of 2007 destroyed 254 structures. Current rules allow for property
owners to pursue the replacement of previously existing development. Provisions allow for an
expedited permitting process for landowners and for granting of fee waivers and allocation
requirements. Coverage that was preexisting, including coverage located within SEZs and on steep
slopes, may be redeveloped. Various agencies including the Conservancy, El Dorado County, and
USFS have implemented erosion control techniques and provided assistance with removal of
hazardous trees in the area. These agencies are proposing additional restoration activities including
channel reconstruction and meadow and wetland complex restoration in the burn area.
Status: Angora Fire restoration and redevelopment is ongoing. It is expected that additional
restoration and redevelopment will continue for the next five to ten years.

Additional Urban
Development

Description: This urban development would consist of numerous small residential, commercial,
industrial, and infrastructure projects in the project vicinity and elsewhere in the watershed of the
Upper Truckee River and south shore of Lake Tahoe. These projects might include some construction
activities in the channel of perennial or intermittent waterways (e.g., at road and utility crossings).
Based on current land use planning and projected changes in population, additional urban
development in the project vicinity, the Upper Truckee River watershed, and the south shore of Lake
Tahoe is likely. Based on a review of land cover and general plan land use designations within the
watershed (using the GIS data layers from CAL FIRE 2002, and California Interagency Watershed
Mapping Committee 2004), approximately 8 percent of the watershed is in natural vegetation within
areas zoned for developed land uses, and thus a portion of this natural vegetation could be converted
to developed land uses in the foreseeable future. However, zoning does not necessarily guarantee
development as most of the Basin is fully developed and most improvements are within existing
developed land uses. Most development in the area consists of numerous small residential,
commercial, industrial, and infrastructure projects. These projects might include some construction
activities in the channel of perennial or intermittent waterways (e.g., at road and utility crossings).
Status: Additional urban development is ongoing, and anticipated to be ongoing throughout
implementation of the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Project.

CUMULATIVE IMPACT ANALYSIS

AIR QUALITY
IMPACT
3.18-C1
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Air Quality—Short-Term Emissions of Criteria Air Pollutants and Precursors during
Construction. Without Environmental Commitment 1, emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOX) from
constructing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) and simultaneous construction projects in the
Lake Tahoe Air Basin could result in an air quality violation, contribute substantially to an existing or
projected air quality violation, and/or expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations.
However, the project proponents would implement several measures to reduce construction-generated
emissions of reactive organic gases (ROG), NOX, and respirable particulate matter less than or equal to
10 microns in diameter (PM10). Proponents of other projects in the air basin would be required to
implement similar measures and be evaluated using similar thresholds of significance. These required
measures and thresholds of significance have been designed to ensure that cumulatively significant
impacts on air quality would not result if the applicable measures (as discussed in Section 3.2, “Air
Quality”) were implemented by future projects and thresholds of significance are not exceeded. These
measures would be implemented and associated criteria would be attained under Alternatives 1–4. In
addition, Alternatives 1–4 would not exceed the El Dorado County Air Quality Management District’s
(EDCAQMD) short-term significance thresholds of 82 pounds per day of ROG or NOX. Therefore,
implementing Alternatives 1–4 would not result in a considerable contribution to the cumulative effect on
air quality related to construction-generated emissions of ROG, NOX, or PM10. The contribution of

Alternatives 1–4 to this cumulative impact would be less than significant. Implementing the NoProject/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not result in construction-related emissions of criteria
air pollutants and precursors in the study area; therefore Alternative 5 would make no contribution and
would have no impact.
Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would emit criteria air pollutants and precursors
during construction. (These emissions would be greater under Alternative 4 than under Alternatives 1–3.) As
discussed in Impact 3.2-1 (Alts. 1–4), emissions of pollutants generated during construction are short term in
nature but can contribute substantially to air quality violations and nonattainment conditions. Emissions are
associated primarily with operation of heavy-duty construction equipment and fugitive emissions from ground
disturbance and earth-moving activities. With implementation of Environmental Commitment (EC) 1, “Reduce
the Generation of Construction-Related Emissions of ROG, NOX, and PM10,” described in Table 2-6, emissions
associated with Alternatives 1–4 would not be expected to exceed the applicable significance thresholds (82
lb/day of ROG or NOX). Even though EC 1 could reduce emissions below the applicable significance threshold
for most of the alternatives, when taken together, project-generated emissions combined with emissions from
other projects undergoing simultaneous construction could result in violations of or substantial contributions to
ambient air quality standards. This can be especially pronounced in the Tahoe Basin because of strict seasonal
restrictions on construction activities that cause many projects to be under construction at the same time.
Implementation of EC 1 (planned as part of the alternatives) would reduce the project’s potential effects
substantially. Project construction would comply with all applicable TRPA, Bureau of Air Quality Planning, and
Bureau of Air Pollution Control codes—specifically, TRPA Code of Ordinances Section 33.3 (Grading
Standards), Section 60.4 (Best Management Practice Requirements), and Section 65.1 (Air Quality Control). The
project proponents would also implement all required measures to feasibly reduce construction-generated
emissions of ROG, NOX, and PM10. EC 1, planned as part of Alternatives 1–4, includes the following:
(1) obtaining all necessary TRPA permits and approvals and following all required codes and procedures with
respect to BMPs, grading and excavation for the project, and all construction-related and emissions-generating
activities; (2) obtaining all necessary El Dorado County permits and approvals and following all required county
laws and procedures with respect to BMPs, grading and excavation for the project, and all other constructionrelated and emissions-generating activities; and (3) implementing dust control measures for any grading activity
creating substantial quantities of dust in compliance with the provisions of Section 33.3.3 of the TRPA Code of
Ordinances. Implementing these measures would substantially reduce the project’s potential effects, and all
associated criteria would be attained under Alternatives 1–4. Furthermore, proponents of other reasonably
foreseeable projects in the Tahoe Basin would implement similar measures to reduce their emissions of ROG,
NOX, and PM10. With EC 1, implementing Alternatives 1–4 individually would not make a considerable
contribution to impacts related to emissions of ROG, NOX, or PM10. Therefore, the contribution of Alternatives 1–
4 to a cumulative impact on air quality because of construction-generated emissions of NOX would be less than
significant.
No construction would occur under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5), so implementing that
alternative would not result in construction-related emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursors in the study
area; therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution and would have no impact.

(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Air Quality—Long-Term Operational (Regional) Emissions of Criteria Air Pollutants and
Precursors. Long-term project operation under Alternatives 1–4 would not result in regional daily
emissions that would exceed any of the applicable standards, which have been developed to ensure that
present and future projects do not result in cumulatively significant impacts on air quality. Therefore,
implementing any of the action alternatives would not result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to
effects on regional emissions of criteria air pollutants or precursors; this cumulative impact would be less
than significant. Alternative 5 would make no contribution and therefore would have no impact.

Cumulative Impacts

The action alternatives (Alternatives 1-–4) would generate minimal long-term emissions from additional mobile
sources used by recreational visitors (discussed below in Impact 3.18-C3); however, no alternatives propose
pollutant-generating facilities.
For the action alternatives, associated regional emissions of ROG, NOX, PM10, carbon monoxide (CO), and oxides
of sulfur (SOX) from stationary, area, and mobile sources were estimated using the URBEMIS 2007 Version 9.2.4
computer program, as described in Section 3.2, “Air Quality.” Based on this modeling, operation of the project
would result in daily emissions of up to approximately 1.31 lb/day of ROG, 1.90 lb/day of NOX, 0.07 lb/day of
PM10, 14.75 lb/day of CO, and 0.01 lb/day of SOX, which would not exceed any of the applicable standards.
While the original modeling used an operational year (i.e., 2014) earlier than the currently anticipated
construction year of 2015, it continues to represent a conservative estimate of operational emissions. Trips during
2015 and later are not anticipated to increase over those estimates included in the original modeling , and
emission factors for motor vehicles and area sources are anticipated to decrease in future years (e.g., 2030) due to
rules and regulations adopted by EPA, ARB and TRPA. Therefore, the originally modeled emissions represent the
highest daily level of emissions associated with the proposed project. All future emissions would continue to
decrease as a result of equal vehicle trips and lower emissions from mobile and area sources.
In addition, because Alternatives 1-4 would not include the construction or operation of any major sources of
stationary emissions, project implementation would not conflict with any air quality planning efforts. Thus,
generation of long-term operational emissions from the project under Alternatives 1-4 would not violate an air
quality standard, expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations, or conflict with or obstruct
implementation of the applicable air quality plan. Thus, implementing Alternatives 1-4 would not make a
cumulatively considerable contribution to regional emissions of criteria air pollutants or precursors; this impact
would be less than significant. Implementing the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not
result in a project-related increase in emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursors; therefore, Alternative 5
would make no contribution and would have no impact.
IMPACT
3.18-C3
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Air Quality—Long-Term Operational (Local) Emissions of Carbon Monoxide by Mobile
Sources. Although any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would generate additional motor
vehicle trips during operation, the level of service (LOS) at intersections in the project vicinity would not be
reduced to levels that would violate the applicable air quality standard for local mobile-source emissions of
CO (i.e., the 8-hour TRPA standard of 6 parts per million [ppm]). Therefore, when viewed in connection
with the effects of other projects, implementing any of the action alternatives would not make a
cumulatively considerable contribution to effects on local mobile-source CO emissions; this cumulative
impact would be less than significant. Alternative 5 would make no contribution and therefore would
have no impact.

Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would increase vehicle trips (< 20 additional trips
per day) by recreational visitors in the long term, thus generating long-term emissions of CO. Among the action
alternatives, Alternative 1 would involve construction of the most public access facilities and would result in the
most additional visitor trips, followed by Alternatives 3 and 4. Alternative 2, with the fewest public access
facilities, would result in the fewest additional visitor trips.
If these additional trips, in combination with other reasonably foreseeable projects, would change the LOS at
signalized intersections to LOS E or F, an air quality standard for local mobile-source emissions of CO (i.e., the 8hour TRPA standard of 6 ppm) would be violated and sensitive receptors would be exposed to substantial
pollutant concentrations, which would be a cumulatively significant impact. However, according to the
transportation analysis (Section 3.16, “Transportation, Parking, and Circulation”), LOS at signalized intersections
is at acceptable levels. Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would not reduce the LOS at
any signalized intersection to an unacceptable level during any time of the day; nor would it substantially worsen
an already existing LOS of concern at any signalized intersection. Furthermore, reasonably foreseeable projects
would not reduce LOS at intersections affected by the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project. Thus,

implementing Alternatives 1-4 would not make a cumulatively considerable contribution to effects on local
mobile-source CO emissions; this cumulative impact would be less than significant. Implementing the NoProject/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not result in a project-related increase in mobile-source CO
emissions; therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution and would have no impact.
IMPACT
3.18-C4
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Air Quality—Exposure of Sensitive Receptors to Odors. Long-term project operation
under any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would not result in the generation of odors in the
study area or its vicinity, nor would implementation of other known related projects. Construction under
any action alternative and construction of other projects would generate diesel exhaust. However, these
emissions would be short term and intermittent, and would dissipate rapidly. Therefore, when viewed in
connection with the effects of other projects, implementing any of the action alternatives would not make a
cumulatively considerable contribution to objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of people; this
cumulative impact would be less than significant. Alternative 5 would make no contribution and therefore
would have no impact.

Neither Alternatives 1–5 nor other projects would result in any long-term, major sources of odor in the study area
or its vicinity. In addition, the project’s proposed land use type is not one of the types commonly known to
generate odors (e.g., landfill, coffee roaster, wastewater treatment plant). However, for both the action alternatives
(Alternatives 1-4) and for some other projects in the vicinity of the study area, construction would entail using onsite equipment that would emit diesel exhaust. These emissions would be intermittent and short term, and the
exhaust would dissipate rapidly from the source. Therefore, when viewed in connection with the effects of other
known projects, construction and operation under Alternative 1, 2, 3, or 4 would not make a cumulatively
considerable contribution to objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of people; this cumulative impact
would be less than significant. Alternative 5 would make no contribution and therefore would have no impact.
IMPACT
3.18-C5
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Air Quality—Exposure of Sensitive Receptors to Emissions of Hazardous Air
Pollutants. No major sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) (toxic air contaminants [TACs]) exist in
the study area or its vicinity, nor would long-term operation under any of the action alternatives
(Alternatives 1–4) or other known projects result in a major source of HAPs. However, construction for any
action alternative and for reasonably foreseeable projects would result in short-term emission of HAPs in
diesel exhaust. Because these emissions would be short term and diesel exhaust is highly dispersive,
sensitive receptors would not be exposed to substantial quantities of HAPs. Therefore, when viewed in
connection with the effects of other projects, implementing any of the action alternatives would not make in
a cumulatively considerable contribution to the exposure of sensitive receptors to HAPs; this cumulative
impact would be less than significant. Alternative 5 would make no contribution and therefore would
have no impact.

No major sources of HAPs (known in state parlance as TACs) exist in the study area or its vicinity. Reasonably
foreseeable projects also would not create a long-term source of HAPs in the study area or its vicinity, but some
short-term emissions of HAPs could occur when such projects are constructed in the vicinity of the study area.
Similarly, the project’s action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would not create a long-term source of HAPs in the
study area or its vicinity, but on-site heavy-duty equipment would emit HAPs in diesel exhaust during
construction. (These emissions would be greater under Alternative 4 than under Alternatives 1-3.) Because offroad heavy-duty diesel equipment would be used only temporarily, and because of the highly dispersive
properties of diesel PM (Zhu et al. 2002), construction of Alternatives 1-4 and of other projects would not expose
sensitive receptors to substantial emissions of HAPs. Thus, implementing Alternative 1, 2, 3, or 4 would not
expose sensitive receptors to substantial emissions of HAPs, either individually or in combination with other
projects. As a result, implementing any of the action alternatives would not result in a considerable incremental
contribution to a cumulatively significant exposure of sensitive receptors to emissions of HAPs; this cumulative
impact would be less than significant. Alternative 5 would make no contribution and therefore would have no
impact.

(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Air Quality—Generation of Greenhouse Gases. Implementation of any of the action
alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would not result in the generation of substantial short-term construction or
long-term operation-related emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). When considered in conjunction with
other projects throughout the region, the project’s emissions would not affect GHG reduction planning
efforts. Therefore, implementing the project would not result in a considerable contribution to cumulative
effects on generation of GHGs; this cumulative impact would be less than significant. No construction or
operational activities would occur in the study area under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative
5); therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution and would have no impact.

Construction-related GHG emissions were estimated for each alternative using URBEMIS 2007, Version 9.2.4.
Operation-related emissions, including direct (e.g., maintenance) and indirect (e.g., vehicle trips) emissions were
also calculated using URBEMIS 2007. A complete project-level GHG analysis is provided in Section 3.2, “Air
Quality and Climate Change.”
Construction-Generated Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Activities associated with constructing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would occur during a
period of approximately four years. During this time, construction-related GHG emissions would be associated
with engine exhaust from heavy-duty construction equipment, material transport trucks, and worker commute
trips. Although any increase in GHG emissions would add to the quantity of emissions that contribute to global
climate change, emissions associated with construction of the project would occur over a limited period.
Following completion of the project, all construction emissions would cease. Despite the intensity and duration of
construction activities and the lack of available mitigation measures to abate GHG emissions from heavy-duty
construction equipment and on-road hauling emissions, the incremental contribution to climate change by the
project’s construction emissions would be short term and minimal and would not be a considerable contribution to
the cumulative condition.
To establish additional context in which to consider the magnitude of project-generated construction-related GHG
emissions, it may be noted that facilities (i.e., stationary, continuous sources of GHG emissions) in California that
generate greater than 25,000 metric tons of CO2 per year are mandated to report their GHG emissions to ARB
pursuant to Assembly Bill (AB) 32. As shown in Table 3.18-7, estimated GHG emissions associated with
constructing the project would be a maximum of 449 metric tons of CO2 per year under the conditions for the
highest emitting alternative (Year 3 of Alternative 4).
The project would generate substantially less emissions than the ARB reporting level of 25,000 metric tons of
CO2 per year and the cap-and-trade level of 10,000 metric tons of CO2 per year set by AB 32. This information is
presented for informational purposes only, and it is not the intention of the Conservancy to adopt 25,000 or
10,000 metric tons of CO2 per year as a numeric threshold. Rather, the intention is to put project-generated GHG
emissions in the appropriate context to evaluate whether the project’s contribution to the global impact of climate
change is considered substantial. Because construction-related emissions under all alternatives would be short
term, minimal, and finite in nature (i.e., would not be continuing) and would not approach emissions levels of
concern to agencies that have established emission reporting levels, the project’s construction-related GHG
emissions would not be a considerable contribution to the cumulative condition; this cumulative impact would be
less than significant. No construction activities would occur under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative
(Alternative 5); therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution and would have no impact.
Operation-Related GHG Emissions
Operation-related GHG emissions would be generated by area and mobile sources during the life of the project.
Area-source GHG emissions would be associated with maintenance largely related to maintaining public access
infrastructure, waste disposal, and other miscellaneous activities. Existing maintenance programs would continue
as they do today. The largest increase in emissions would occur under Alternative 1, which would entail the most

The values presented do not include the full life cycle of GHG emissions that occur over the production/transport of materials used during
construction of the project, solid waste that occurs over the life of the project, and the end-of-life of the materials and processes that
indirectly result from the project. Estimation of the GHG emissions associated with these processes would be speculative, would require
analysis beyond the current state of the art in impact assessment, and may lead to a false or misleading level of precision in reporting of
project-related GHG emissions.

Construction emissions were modeled with the URBEMIS 2007 computer model. The URBEMIS 2007 model does not account for CO 2
emissions associated with the production of concrete or other building materials used in project construction. It also does not estimate
emissions for GHGs other than CO2, such as CH4 and N2O, because the emission levels of these other GHGs are expected to be nominal
in comparison to the estimated CO2 levels despite their higher global warming potential.

public access facilities in the study area. No alternative would involve municipal water use; therefore,
implementing the project would not generate off-site GHG emissions associated with water conveyance,
treatment, and consumption. Quantification of sequestration of carbon by vegetation is not feasible without an
accurate inventory of vegetation types and sequestration rates. Nonetheless, it was assumed that carbon
sequestration would remain similar to existing conditions because the site would remain in natural vegetation, and
although some changes in vegetation type would likely reduce sequestration rates in small areas (e.g., where
Jeffrey pine forest would be replaced with other vegetation), other changes in vegetation type in large areas would
likely increase carbon sequestration rates (e.g., conversion of montane meadow to willow-scrub). Mobile-source
GHG emissions would be generated by the slight increase in project-related vehicle trips associated with the
improvements to public access infrastructure in the study area attracting some additional visitors. Table 3.18-8
presents the operation-related GHG emissions associated with Alternative 1, the highest emitting alternative.
Estimates of mobile-source GHG emissions are based on the traffic analysis prepared for the project, which
estimates fewer than 100 additional trips per day under Alternative 1, compared to existing conditions, which are
associated with an increase in recreational users.
While the original modeling used an operational year (i.e., 2014) earlier than the currently anticipated
construction year of 2015, it continues to represent a conservative estimate of operational emissions. Trips during
2015 and later are not anticipated to increase over those estimates included in the original modeling , and
emission factors for motor vehicles and area sources are anticipated to decrease in future years (e.g., 2030) due to
rules and regulations adopted by EPA, ARB and TRPA. Therefore, the originally modeled emissions represent the
highest daily level of emissions associated with the proposed project. All future emissions would continue to
decrease as a result of equal vehicle trips and lower emissions from mobile and area sources.

Direct operation-related emissions (i.e., area and mobile sources) were modeled using the URBEMIS 2007 computer model, based on trip
generation rates obtained from the traffic analysis, as well as the other assumptions and input parameters used to estimate criteria air
pollutant emissions. Mobile source emissions assume nine trips per day above existing conditions. Year 2018 is the earliest year when
completion of the project would likely occur. URBEMIS does not estimate emissions for GHGs other than CO2, such as CH4 and NO2,
because the emission levels of these other GHGs are expected to be nominal in comparison to the estimated CO 2 levels despite their

For context (as with construction emissions), projects that generate more than 25,000 metric tons of CO2 per year
are mandated to report GHG emissions to ARB pursuant to AB 32. As shown in Table 3.18-8, the estimated
increase in GHG emissions associated with operation of Alternative 1 would be approximately 111 metric tons of
CO2 per year. Again, implementing any of the action alternatives would generate substantially fewer emissions
than the above-referenced threshold levels of 25,000 and 10,000 metric tons of CO2 per year. Because operationrelated emissions would not approach the recommended thresholds of ARB and legislation that have established
screening levels, the project’s GHG emissions would not be a considerable contribution to the cumulative
condition. The project’s contribution to this cumulative impact would be less than significant. No operational
activities would occur under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5); therefore, Alternative 5 would
make no contribution and would have no impact.

(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Archaeological and Historical Resources—Damage to or Destruction of Potentially
Significant Cultural Resources or Human Remains. In the Tahoe Basin, past and ongoing
development and natural forces, such as erosion and weathering, have been reducing the information
potential and cultural value of prehistoric- and ethnographic-period cultural resources and human remains.
Significant, undocumented, buried archaeological materials or human remains may be present that could
be damaged or destroyed by grading or excavation associated with Alternatives 1–4. However,
implementation of Environmental Commitments 2 and 3 would ensure that project-related activities would
not make a considerable contribution to cumulative effects on important undocumented cultural resources.
This cumulative impact would be less than significant. No construction activities would occur in the study
area under Alternative 5. For this reason, Alternative 5 would make no contribution to a cumulative impact;
however, natural forces would continue to affect information potential and cultural value of cultural
resources within the study area and throughout the Tahoe Basin. This impact would be less than
significant.

Research conducted for the project indicates that the study area contains one prehistoric cultural resource that is
considered significant as defined by CEQA, Section 106, and TRPA criteria. Undiscovered cultural resources may
also be present in the study area. However, as described in Environmental Commitments EC 2, “Prepare and
Implement a Cultural Resources Protection Plan,” and EC 3, “Stop Work within an Appropriate Radius around
the Discovered Human Remains, Notify the El Dorado County Coroner and the Most Likely Descendants, and
Treat Remains in Accordance with State and Federal Law” would reduce impacts on prehistoric and historic-era
resources and human interments to a less-than-significant level under all action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4).
The Conservancy would prepare a cultural resources protection plan that would include oversight of grading in
areas that could have the potential to find significant resources in the vicinity of CA-ELD-26/H. Additionally,
project construction personnel would be trained on the possibility of encountering potentially significant resources
and human remains; if encountered, proper measures would be taken to protect them. Furthermore, final design of
the bike path will completely avoid the CA-ELD-26/H site. Therefore, the action alternatives would comply with
CEQA, Section 106, and TRPA guidance and would not incrementally contribute to any significant cumulative
impacts on important cultural resources in the project vicinity.
Cumulatively considerable effects on cultural resources would be avoided by implementing ECs 2 and 3, planned
as part of the alternatives, which would reduce or eliminate impacts on site CA-Eld-26, presently undocumented
cultural resources, and human remains. If project-related destruction or disturbance of these resources is reduced
or eliminated, the integrity of these resources would be maintained, and, except for natural degradation, these sites
would remain as they are for an extensive period, providing future cultural information opportunities and serving
as traces of traditional lifeways and industries once common in the Tahoe Basin. Therefore, implementing ECs 2
and 3 would ensure that project-related activities would not make a considerable contribution to cumulative
effects on important undocumented cultural resources or human remains.
The contribution to cumulative impacts to undocumented cultural resources or human remains would be less than
significant for Alternatives 1–4. Under Alternative 5 (No-Project/No-Action), no construction activities would
occur, so no undocumented, potentially significant cultural resources would be damaged or destroyed. Therefore,
Alternative 5 would make no contribution to a cumulative impact; however, natural forces would continue to
affect information potential and cultural value of cultural resources within the study area and throughout the
Tahoe Basin. This impact would be less than significant.

BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES: VEGETATION AND WILDLIFE
IMPACT
3.18-C8
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Biological Resources: Vegetation and Wildlife—Introduction and Spread of Invasive
Plants. Despite the implementation of minimization measures, reasonably foreseeable projects could
contribute to the introduction and spread of invasive plants in the vicinity of the study area. Under the
action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4), construction activities could introduce or spread invasive plants, and
recreational use could increase in portions of the study area, which in turn could increase the introduction
and spread of invasive plants. However, Environmental Commitment 4, planned as part of the alternatives,
would substantially reduce the potential for construction activities to introduce and spread invasive
species. Furthermore, each action alternative removes user-created trails, which would reduce human
disturbance in the core habitat area. Therefore, in connection with other projects, none of the alternatives
would make a considerable contribution to this cumulative effect; this cumulative impact would be less
than significant. Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5), ongoing management by the
Conservancy would continue to control the introduction and spread of invasive plants in the study area,
and best management practices implemented by others would limit the introduction and spread of invasive
plants in the watershed. This impact would be less than significant.

Past actions have introduced and contributed to the spread of a number of invasive plant species in the watershed
of the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek. Under the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4), construction
activities could introduce or spread invasive plants, and recreational use could increase in portions of the study
area, which in turn could increase the introduction and spread of invasive plants. The potential for causing these

effects differs among the action alternatives. Ground disturbance is a major factor affecting the introduction and
spread of invasive species and differs among alternatives. Implementing Alternative 2 or 4 would disturb the
greatest and least acreage, respectively, and implementing Alternative 1 or 3 would disturb comparable,
intermediate acreages. However, for all the action alternatives, the duration of construction activities would be the
same, and ground disturbance would be dispersed over a comparable area; these are the two most important
factors affecting the potential of construction activities to introduce and spread invasive plants. Alternative 1
would have the greatest and Alternative 2 the least potential for increasing recreational use of the study area;
Alternatives 3 and 4 would have intermediate effects on recreation use. This increase in use provides the
opportunity to introduce and spread invasives through accidental transport by humans (e.g., attached to shoes,
tires, and dogs).
EC 4, “Prepare and Implement Invasive Species Management Plan,” was planned as part of the alternatives to
reduce the potential for introducing and spreading invasive plants. This environmental commitment involves
cleaning construction machinery, using seed and other erosion control materials free of invasive plant seed,
conducting preconstruction and postconstruction monitoring, and removing invasive plants. These measures
would substantially reduce the potential for construction activities to introduce and spread invasive species.
Each alternative also involves removing user-created trails in the core habitat area, which would reduce human
disturbance, and the introduction and spread of invasive plants, over the long term in the core habitat area. The
Conservancy would also continue to incorporate best management practices throughout the study area to control
introduction and spread of invasive weeds related to recreation activities under all alternatives.
Best management practices would also continue to be implemented by others in the basin (e.g., USFS, California
Conservation Corps, California DPR) to control the introduction and spread of invasive species.
Because none of the action alternatives would make a considerable contribution to this cumulative effect, their
contribution would be less than significant.
Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5), the Conservancy would continue to limit the
introduction and spread of invasive plants in the study area. Similarly, in the rest of the watershed, reasonably
foreseeable projects would incorporate best management practices as required by TRPA and Lahontan Regional
Water Quality Control Board to limit the introduction and spread of invasives. Therefore, under Alternative 5, a
cumulatively considerable contribution to the introduction and spread of invasive plants would not occur. This
impact would be less than significant.

Cumulative Biological Resources: Vegetation and Wildlife—Construction-Related Effects on
Special-Status Plants and Sensitive Habitats (Jurisdictional Wetlands, Riparian Vegetation, and

disturbances that could affect special-status plants and sensitive habitats in the Upper Truckee River–
Trout Creek watershed. These effects would be reduced by implementing avoidance and minimization
measures. The action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) could affect Tahoe yellow cress and would affect
sensitive habitats. Regarding Tahoe yellow cress, implementing Mitigation Measure 3.4-3 would fully
mitigate this potential effect. Therefore, the cumulative impact to special-status plants would be less than
significant. Regarding sensitive habitats, Alternatives 1–4 would reduce construction-related effects by
implementing Environmental Commitments 5 and 6. Nonetheless, Alternatives 1–4 would entail short-term
disturbance of some sensitive habitats within the study area. After implementation of all feasible mitigation
measures, these short-term effects would remain significant and would make a considerable contribution
to the overall significant cumulative effect on sensitive habitats in the watershed. Therefore, the
contribution of any of the action alternatives to this cumulative impact would be significant. No
construction would occur under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5); therefore, Alternative
5 would make no contribution to construction-related effects on special status plants and sensitive habitats
and would have no impact.

Past actions have converted land to developed uses and substantially altered the hydrologic, geomorphic, and
habitat conditions of most natural vegetation in the study area. As a result of these alterations, the ecological
functions of some habitats have been impaired, and a number of plant species have been substantially adversely
affected. In addition, reasonably foreseeable projects would involve construction activities that would cause shortterm disturbances that could affect special-status plants and sensitive habitats in the Upper Truckee River–Trout
Creek watershed. These projects would incorporate measures to avoid or minimize these effects, but some
residual effects would likely contribute to the significant overall cumulative impact on the watershed’s sensitive
habitats and potentially to the overall cumulative effect on special-status plant species.
Implementing Alternative 1, 2, or 3 would entail construction activities that could affect Tahoe yellow cress.
However, Mitigation Measure 3.4-3, which is planned as part of the alternatives, would require protocol-level
surveys for Tahoe yellow cress and avoidance and minimization measures that would fully mitigate constructionrelated effects on any occupied habitat. Therefore, the construction-related effects of Alternatives 1-3 would not
contribute to the overall cumulative effect on Tahoe yellow cress. Alternative 4 does not propose construction in
the vicinity of Tahoe yellow cress and therefore would have no effect.
Implementing any of the action alternatives would entail short-term disturbance of some sensitive habitats (e.g.,
jurisdictional wetlands, riparian vegetation, and SEZs). This short-term disturbance would likely affect the
greatest acreage under Alternative 2, would be least under Alternatives 1 and 4 that would have comparable
effects, and the effect of Alternative 3 would be intermediate.
Construction-related disturbance of sensitive communities and the potential effects of that disturbance on related
ecosystem functions would be substantially reduced by implementing EC 5, “Prepare and Implement Effective
Construction Site Management Plans to Minimize Risks of Water Quality Degradation and Impacts to
Vegetation,” and EC 6, “Obtain and Comply with Federal, State, Regional, and Local Permits.” Nonetheless,
considerable short-term disturbance of sensitive communities would be unavoidable because such disturbance is
integral to the river, floodplain, and other restoration elements of the action alternatives. This impact on sensitive
habitats would be significant and would make a considerable contribution to the overall cumulative impact on the
watershed’s sensitive habitats. Thus, the short-term contribution of any of the action alternatives to this
cumulative impact would be significant.
All feasible measures to avoid or further reduce the short-term, construction-related impacts of Alternatives 1–4
on special-status plants and sensitive communities have been incorporated into the design of the alternatives.
Additional feasible mitigation is not available to reduce this impact to less than significant, so the residual impact
would be significant and unavoidable.
No construction would occur under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5); therefore, it would
make no contribution and would have no impact.

Cumulative Biological Resources: Vegetation and Wildlife—Long-Term Effects on Special-Status
Plants and Sensitive Habitats (Jurisdictional Wetlands, Riparian Vegetation, and SEZs). The

implemented and other projects would avoid or minimize their effects on sensitive habitats; for other
sensitive habitats (e.g., beach), conditions would remain similar to existing conditions. Under the action

improved, and human disturbance limited. Although the magnitude of these effects would be different for
each action alternative, combining the effects of any of the action alternatives with those of other ongoing
and future river restoration projects in the Tahoe Basin would result in an increase in acreage and quality
of some sensitive habitats. This contribution to a cumulative effect would be beneficial. As a result of

remain similar to existing conditions or would be improved. Tahoe yellow cress could be adversely
affected by several reasonably foreseeable projects. Under Alternative 2, there would be a long-term
increase in special-status plant habitats, and this contribution to a cumulative effect would also be
beneficial. Under Alternatives 3 and 4, the extent of special-status plant habitat and the long-term effects
of human activities on special-status plants would remain comparable to existing conditions. This
cumulative impact would be less than significant. Alternative 1, however, would negatively affect Tahoe
yellow cress by creating additional recreation features (the bridge and boardwalk) in the vicinity of
occupied habitat that would create the opportunity for damage by recreationists. Alternative 1 would
contribute to a cumulative effect from habitat loss and human activities on Tahoe yellow cress. This impact
would be significant. Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5), the Conservancy would
continue to provide an exclosure for Tahoe yellow cress and other sensitive plants and existing sensitive
habitats would remain. This impact would be less than significant.
In the Upper Truckee River–Trout Creek watershed, reasonably foreseeable projects would have a cumulatively
beneficial effect on some sensitive habitats (e.g., jurisdictional wetlands, riparian vegetation, and SEZs) because
restoration projects would be implemented and other projects would be required to avoid or minimize effects on
sensitive habitats.
Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would increase the extent and quality of other
sensitive habitats (e.g., jurisdictional wetlands, riparian vegetation, and SEZs). These beneficial effects would
result from restoring habitat through habitat creation and improving geomorphic and hydrologic conditions (e.g.,
increasing the frequency, duration, and extent of overbank flows). Alternatives 2 and 3 would create the greatest
acreages of sensitive habitats, and Alternative 1 would create the least; Alternative 4 would create an intermediate
acreage. Each action alternative would limit human disturbance in a core habitat area. The acreage of this core
habitat area would be greatest under Alternatives 2 and 4, and smallest under Alternative 3; Alternative 1 would
have an intermediate sized acreage of core habitat. For the action alternatives, this contribution to a cumulative
effect would be beneficial.
As a result of reasonably foreseeable projects, conditions for special-status plants, except for Tahoe yellow cress,
would be improved or remain similar to existing conditions. In the Upper Truckee River–Trout Creek watershed,
the combined long-term effect of reasonably foreseeable projects on some special-status plants could be beneficial
because restoration projects would be implemented and other projects would avoid or minimize their effects on
special-status plants; for other special-status plants and sensitive habitats, conditions would remain similar to
existing conditions. Reasonably foreseeable projects are not expected to affect American mannagrass.
Tahoe yellow cress could be adversely affected by construction and recreation activities resulting from reasonably
foreseeable projects (e.g., Edgewood Lodge and Golf Course Improvement Project). Also, as discussed in Impact
3.18-C30 (Alts. 1–5), “Cumulative Geomorphology and Water Quality—Long-Term Modifications in Upper
Truckee River Coarse Sediment Transport and Delivery Downstream,” depending on the alternatives
implemented by upstream restoration projects and depending on the effects of climate change, the delivery of
sands and gravel to Tahoe yellow cress habitat at the study area’s beaches could be affected. Potential effects of
the action alternatives (particularly Alternatives 1-3) could combine with effects of other actions on transport and
delivery of coarse sediment; however, the incremental or combined effects on beach erosion are not predictable
because climate change influences are highly uncertain. Conditions could range from worse than the existing
degraded condition to a possible improvement regardless of changes in coarse sediment delivery. After thorough
investigation, the cumulative effect on delivery of coarse sediment to the study area’s beaches remains
speculative.
The action alternatives differ in their effects on special-status plants. Under Alternative 2, lagoon restoration
would increase the extent of potential habitat for American mannagrass, and the restoration and increased
inundation of willow scrub-wet meadow under this alternative could also increase the extent of habitat. However,
both of these effects are uncertain and may not alter the extent of suitable habitat for American mannagrass.

Under Alternative 2, beach and dune restoration could, and new river mouth construction likely would, increase
the extent of habitat suitable for Tahoe yellow cress. Therefore, this contribution to a cumulative effect would be
beneficial.
Under Alternatives 3 and 4, the extent of habitat for special-status plants and the long-term effects of human
activities on those habitats would remain largely unaltered. Thus, the contribution of these alternatives to the
overall cumulative impact on special-status plants would be less than significant.
Although it includes lagoon restoration that could benefit American mannagrass, Alternative 1 could potentially
negatively affect Tahoe yellow cress by creating additional recreation features (the bridge and boardwalk) in the
vicinity of occupied habitat that would create the opportunity for damage by recreationists. This contribution to
the overall cumulative effect on Tahoe yellow cress of habitat loss and damage from human activities would be
significant. Additional feasible mitigation is not available to reduce this impact to less than significant, so the
residual impact would be significant and unavoidable.
Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5), the Conservancy would continue to provide
exclosures for Tahoe yellow cress and existing habitat for sensitive plant species would remain comparable to
existing conditions. This impact would be less than significant.

Cumulative Biological Resources: Vegetation and Wildlife—Short-Term Effects on Common or
Special-Status Wildlife Resources and Wildlife Movement Corridors. Reasonably foreseeable
projects would involve construction activities that would cause short-term disturbances that could disrupt
common and special-status wildlife use of habitats, including as movement corridors. Measures would be
implemented to avoid or minimize these construction-related effects. Nonetheless, some effects on
common and special-status species could occur. Implementing any of the action alternatives would cause
construction-related disturbance that could potentially affect use of the study area by special-status wildlife
species (e.g., willow fly catcher, yellow warbler) and would affect use of the study area by common wildlife
species. Mitigation planned as part of the alternatives would avoid effects on most special-status wildlife
species, but not on waterfowl. When viewed in connection with other projects, the contribution of any of
the action alternatives to effects on common wildlife species would not be cumulatively considerable
because construction-related effects on common wildlife species would be short term, would occur at noncontiguous locations and not be concurrent, and would affect only a small portion of available habitat. The
contribution of any of the action alternatives to this cumulative impact would be less than significant. For
these same reasons, the contribution of any of the action alternatives to short-term effects on wildlife
movement corridors would not be cumulatively considerable, and this cumulative impact would be less
than significant. However, the effects to special-status species, specifically waterfowl, could not be
avoided by implementing environmental commitments or mitigation measures, and the contribution of any
of the action alternatives to this cumulative impact would be significant. Alternative 5 would make no
contribution and therefore would have no impact.

Past actions have converted land to developed uses and substantially altered hydrologic, geomorphic, and habitat
conditions of most natural vegetation in the study area. As a result of these alterations, the ecological functions of
some habitats have been impaired, and a number of wildlife species have been substantially adversely affected. In
the Upper Truckee River–Trout Creek watershed, reasonably foreseeable projects would involve construction
activities that would cause short-term disturbances that could disrupt wildlife use of habitats, including as
movement corridors. Some projects could potentially affect special-status wildlife species, but measures would be
implemented to avoid or minimize construction-related effects. Nonetheless, some effects on common and
special-status species could occur.
Under the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4), without mitigation, construction-related disturbance could
potentially affect use of the study area by special-status wildlife species (e.g., yellow warbler) and would affect
use of the study area by common wildlife species, including use of the study area as a movement corridor. This

short-term disturbance would likely be greatest under Alternative 4 and least under Alternative 1; Alternatives 2
and 3 would have comparable, intermediate effects.
Because construction-related effects of the action alternatives and other projects on common wildlife species and
wildlife movement corridors would be short term, would occur at non-contiguous locations and not be concurrent,
and would affect only a small portion of available habitat, there would not be a substantial cumulative effect on
common wildlife species or on wildlife movement corridors. Thus, when viewed in connection with the effects of
other projects, the effects of any of the action alternatives would not be cumulatively considerable, and thus, the
contribution of any of the action alternatives to this cumulative impact would be less than significant.
Effects on special-status wildlife would be avoided or reduced by mitigation planned as part of these alternatives
(Mitigation Measures 3.4-8A and 3.4-8B [Alts. 1–4]). This mitigation includes conducting preconstruction
surveys for special-status wildlife and, if necessary, using buffers and/or limiting operation periods, which would
avoid the loss of individuals, nests, or roost sites of special-status wildlife species, except for effects on waterfowl
nesting. Because of this effect on waterfowl, any of the action alternatives would make a considerable
contribution to cumulative effects on special-status wildlife resources. This contribution would be a significant
impact.
Because waterfowl likely nest near the river mouth, Sailing Lagoon, Trout Creek Lagoon, and elsewhere within
the study area for a considerable portion of the construction season, implementing buffers or a limited operation
period that would avoid substantial effects on waterfowl nesting would not be feasible. Feasible mitigation is not
available to reduce this impact to less than significant, so the residual impact would be significant and
unavoidable.
Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5), conditions in the study area would remain similar to
existing conditions. Alternative 5 would make no contribution and therefore would have no impact.

future conditions would remain similar to existing conditions. Under the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–
4), the long-term ecosystem response to restoring the river and floodplain, enhancing forest habitat, and
limiting human disturbance would be substantially improved habitat quality and functions for riparian and
aquatic wildlife, including special-status species, such as yellow warbler, willow flycatcher, and waterfowl.
River and floodplain restoration would also increase the size and enhance the functions of TRPAdesignated wildlife habitats of special significance (i.e., wetlands, meadows, and riparian areas). When
viewed in connection with the effects of other projects, which include several ongoing and future river
restoration projects, implementing any of the action alternatives would not contribute to a cumulative
adverse impact on common and special-status wildlife species associated with riparian, wetland, and
aquatic habitat and with forest wildlife habitats. Rather, this effect would be beneficial. By increasing
habitat quality, connectivity of native vegetation, and corridor width, the beneficial effect of the action

because several restoration projects would be implemented and other projects would be required to avoid or

Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would increase the extent and quality of habitat for
special-status and common wildlife species. These beneficial effects would result from restoring habitat (through

habitat creation), improving geomorphic and hydrologic conditions (e.g., increasing the frequency, duration, and
extent of overbank flows), enhancing forest habitat, and constructing features to reduce the effects of human
disturbance on habitat.
The action alternatives include long-term restoration and enhancement of forest, riparian, lagoon, and beach
habitats. Alternatives 1 and 2 include lagoon and beach restoration that would benefit a variety of species,
including shorebirds and waterfowl. All the action alternatives involve restoring and enhancing wetlands, riparian
vegetation, and SEZs by creating additional acreage, improving geomorphic and hydrologic conditions, and
limiting human disturbance. (The public access elements of the alternatives include features to limit human
disturbance.) Alternatives 2-4 involve creating (and improving the geomorphic and hydrologic conditions of)
more acres of these sensitive habitats than would be created and improved under Alternative 1. Human
disturbance of sensitive habitats would be limited in a larger core area under Alternative 2 or 4 than under
Alternative 1 or 3 (with Alternative 3 having the smallest core area).
Under the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4), the long-term ecosystem response to river and floodplain
restoration and enhancement and to other restoration and enhancement features of the alternatives would be
substantially improved habitat quality and functions, particularly for riparian and aquatic wildlife, including
special-status species, such as yellow warbler, willow flycatcher, and waterfowl. River and floodplain restoration
would also increase the size and enhance the functions of TRPA-designated wildlife habitats of special
significance (i.e., wetlands, meadows, and riparian areas).
In summary, implementing any of the action alternatives would restore, enhance, and protect common and
special-status wildlife species associated with riparian, wetland, and aquatic habitat and TRPA-designated
wildlife habitats of special significance. Thus, none of the action alternatives would make a considerable
contribution to a cumulatively significant adverse effect; rather, this effect would be beneficial.
By increasing habitat quality, connectivity of native vegetation, and corridor width, the beneficial effect of the
action alternatives on wildlife habitats would also improve the SEZ’s wildlife corridor function. This effect would

Cumulative Fisheries—Short-Term Disruption of Aquatic Habitat and Movement Corridors for Fish.
Construction activities associated with the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would temporarily affect
the lowest reach of the Upper Truckee River. The Marsh Reach is the downstream connection between
the Upper Truckee River and Lake Tahoe and therefore is an important link between the lake and river for
such species as Lahontan cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, mountain whitefish, Tahoe sucker, and Lahontan
redside. Aquatic habitat supporting trout and native fishes would be temporarily eliminated during the time
the channel is dewatered. During the period that water is pumped around a dewatered reach, fish
movement within the Upper Truckee River would be restricted. A summer disruption would have little to no
effect on species which migrate into the river and spawn in the spring or fall (e.g. rainbow trout, Lahontan
cutthroat trout, and mountain whitefish). A short-term disruption of localized aquatic habitat and access
would not impair the ability of river dwelling fish (e.g. Lahontan redside, Tahoe sucker) to persist in the
river. Most spawning of these species occurs upstream of the Marsh Reach. Therefore, when viewed in
connection with the effects of other projects, implementing any of the action alternatives would not result in
a cumulatively considerable contribution to this impact; this cumulative impact would be less than
significant. Implementing the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not cause any

aquatic habitat supporting fishes in the Upper Truckee River; no impact would occur.

Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would result in channel improvements that could
temporarily disrupt migration corridors and the availability of habitat during the summer construction period.
Most lake dwelling, river spawning fish (e.g. Lahontan cutthroat trout, rainbow trout) migrate into the Upper
Truckee River during spring and fall to access spawning habitat in the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek.
Restoration project implementation would disrupt river flow continuity during summer and into early fall, when
restored channel segments are activated. Projects in the Upper Truckee River could also potentially affect river
dwelling fish species (e.g. Lahontan redside, Tahoe sucker, and Paiute sculpin). However, the scope of restoration
projects is limited by the amount of work that can be accomplished in a single season. Sufficient unaffected
habitat would be available to support the spawning and rearing needs of these fish in the Upper Truckee River.
Mountain suckers are a state species of special concern. They spawn in mountain streams during the early
summer months (Moyle 2002) and may make short migrations before, during, or following the spawning season.
Mountain suckers have been documented in the Upper Truckee River (Conservancy and DGS 2007a). Restoration
actions could overlap with the spawning period for mountain suckers. However, mountain suckers are a river
dwelling - river spawning species and restoration projects would not restrict habitat in multiple reaches of the
river in any given construction year. Unaffected reaches of the Upper Truckee River would continue to provide
sufficient habitat for mountain sucker movement and spawning.
In-channel construction and other restoration work would occur in different years for the various projects planned
for the Upper Truckee River. The first restoration project was constructed in summer 2008 on Reaches 3 and 4
(Table 3.18-3) and required diverting water around dewatered sections in late summer. Summer dewatering in the
Upper Truckee River could occur in one or more reaches during summer from 2015 through 2018. The
cumulative impact of these future activities is unlikely to directly affect access to spawning habitat normally
available in the Upper Truckee River for lake dwelling, river spawning fish or for river dwelling species because
the timing of flow discontinuity would occur outside the spawning and migration season, or for river dwelling
species that spawn during summer, it would not affect local sites used for migration and spawning opportunities.

Note: Active construction includes any disturbance on the floodplain or in the active channel requiring dewatering, diverting water around a

Implementing any of the action alternatives would not disrupt spawning because the project would occur outside
of the migration and spawning period. The area contains low-gradient habitat conditions that do not support
spawning habitat. It is unlikely that any single project would substantially reduce habitat availability and access to
spawning habitat in the Upper Truckee River because the flow discontinuity would occur late in the year, after or
before the species that inhabit the river would have spawned. Therefore, the contribution of any of the action
alternatives to this cumulative impact would be less than significant.
Implementing the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not result in project-related short-term

Cumulative Fisheries—Short-Term Disruption of Spawning Migration, Rearing, and Holding
Activity of Lahontan Cutthroat Trout. The action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) include construction
activities that would affect the lowest reach of the Upper Truckee River. Lahontan cutthroat trout occur in
the Upper Truckee River, although hatchery fish were recently sighted near the mouth of the river.
Lahontan cutthroat trout have been reintroduced in the upper watershed, near Meiss Meadows, as part of
an active Lahontan cutthroat trout restoration program. Under any of the action alternatives, Lahontan
cutthroat trout might be present in the project area and could be stranded during construction in dewatered
areas. Implementing Environmental Commitment 7, planned as part of the action alternatives, would
ensure that an aquatic species rescue and relocation plan was implemented. Therefore, when viewed in
connection with the effects of other projects, none of the action alternatives would result in a cumulatively
considerable contribution to effects on rearing and holding activity of Lahontan cutthroat trout. The
contribution of any of the action alternatives to this cumulative impact would be less than significant.
Implementing the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not create any constructionrelated impacts and therefore would not contribute to any short-term cumulative disruption of spawning
migration, rearing, or holding activity of Lahontan cutthroat trout in the Upper Truckee River; no impact
would occur.

Implementing any of the action alternatives would result in channel improvements that could disrupt river flow
continuity during summer and into early fall. Lahontan cutthroat trout were recently observed in Lake Tahoe and
the Upper Truckee River (following a June 2011 release of hatchery fish into Lake Tahoe by the Nevada
Department of Wildlife). However, it is uncertain whether these fish will persist. Lahontan cutthroat trout were
previously reintroduced to the headwaters (near Meiss Meadows) by the LTBMU, but natural migration barriers
exist between the headwaters and reaches undergoing stream restoration projects. As a result of constructionseason restrictions, the restoration projects’ disruption of flow continuity would typically occur after Lahontan
cutthroat trout have spawned. Because the species would not be restricted to any one restoration project reach and
because river flow interruptions for any of the construction seasons would occur late in the summer or early fall,
none of the action alternatives would disrupt spawning activity. In-channel restoration activities for the various
projects would occur in different years and different subreaches along the Upper Truckee River. The cumulative
impact of future activities could result in the short-term disruption of access to spawning habitat for Lahontan
cutthroat trout, depending on fish presence and the timing of flow disruption. However, it is unlikely that any
single project would substantially reduce access to spawning migration for Lahontan cutthroat trout in the Upper
Truckee River because the construction-season flow discontinuity would occur late in the year, after their
migration season.
Under any of the action alternatives, adult or juvenile Lahontan cutthroat trout that might be present in the study
area could potentially be stranded during construction in dewatered areas. However, implementing EC 7, “Prepare
and Implement an Aquatic Species Rescue and Relocation Plan,” would ensure that an aquatic species rescue and
relocation plan that identifies protocols and procedures specific to Lahontan cutthroat trout and approved by
USFWS was prepared in accordance with applicable regulations and implemented by the project proponent. Other
restoration projects planned for the Upper Truckee River would occur during future years and could have different
regulatory requirements, but it is assumed that all projects would comply with federal protections to limit
potential take. Therefore, implementing any of the action alternatives would not result in a cumulative effect on
spawning migration, rearing, or holding activities of Lahontan cutthroat trout in the Upper Truckee River. The
contribution of any of the action alternatives to this cumulative impact would be less than significant.
Implementing the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not result in project-related short-term
disruption of spawning migration, rearing, or holding activity for Lahontan cutthroat trout in the Upper Truckee
River. Under this alternative, the stream channel would not be disturbed, so spawning migration, rearing, and
holding activity by the species would not be disrupted. However, reasonably foreseeable river restoration projects

Cumulative Fisheries—Short-Term Localized Impacts on Fish Abundance and Distribution Related
to Rescue and Relocation. The action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) include construction activities that
would affect the lowest reach of the Upper Truckee River and result in localized effects on fish abundance
and distribution. Implementing Environmental Commitment 7 would minimize the potential for fish mortality
but could result in short-term changes in fish abundance and distribution. With implementation of fish
rescue and relocation actions, the action alternatives would not considerably contribute to effects on
population levels for any fish species and thus would not result in a cumulatively considerable contribution
to effects on fish populations; therefore, this cumulative impact would be less than significant.
Implementing the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not create any constructionrelated impacts and therefore would not contribute to any short-term cumulative localized impacts on fish
abundance and distribution related to fish rescue and relocation in the Upper Truckee River; no impact
would occur.

Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would result in channel improvements that would
involve disrupting aquatic habitat, dewatering channel reaches, and rescuing and relocating fish in the Upper
Truckee River. However, because fish are highly mobile, they would redistribute themselves throughout the river
segments after restoration work is completed and streamflow is restored. There would be no considerable
contribution to long-term population level impacts on introduced trout or native fish populations and therefore no
considerable contribution to a cumulatively significant effect from implementing the action alternatives.
Under the proposed restoration actions, fish species known to occur in the Tahoe Basin would be expected to
occur in the Upper Truckee River and would be present in the channel segments or lagoons of the project area.
During dewatering for construction, EC 7, “Prepare and Implement an Aquatic Species Rescue and Relocation
Plan,” would be implemented, and fish would be rescued before complete dewatering. Fish rescue and relocation
for several proposed restoration actions may occur sequentially or concurrently during summer construction
periods from 2013 to 2018. Some fish mortality would occur as a result of capture and handling, but it would be
minor relative to the number rescued and would not result in effects on population levels. Multiple season and/or
concurrent rescue and relocation efforts would lead to short-term changes in the distribution of fish in the Upper
Truckee River. However, fish are highly mobile and would quickly recolonize restored habitats. Following the
completion of proposed future restoration actions, the fish community would gradually return to a more natural
condition with all species present relative to existing conditions. Therefore, implementing any of the action
alternatives would not result in a considerable contribution to effects on fish populations in the Upper Truckee
River. The contribution of any of the action alternatives to this cumulative impact would be less than significant.
Implementing the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not result in cumulative effects on fish
abundance and distribution related to rescue and relocation in the Upper Truckee River. Under this alternative, the
stream channel would not be disturbed, so there would be no reason to rescue and relocate fish from this reach of
the Upper Truckee River. However, reasonably foreseeable restoration projects would entail construction
activities that could result in localized effects on fish abundance and distribution. Alternative 5 would make no
contribution and therefore would have no impact.

Cumulative Fisheries—Long-Term Increase in Upper Truckee River Habitat Quality. Action
Alternatives 1, 2 and 4 include construction activities that would improve long-term habitat quality in the
study area and therefore support the activities of other projects designed to improve conditions for aquatic
biological resources in the Upper Truckee River. Therefore, when viewed in connection with other
projects, implementing action alternatives 1, 2 and 4 would result in a contribution to beneficial effects on
Upper Truckee River habitat quality. Alternative 3 will improve long-term habitat quality in the study area,
but its design approach (i.e., natural formation of channels downstream of the constructed “pilot channel”)

allows for potential disruption of upstream migrations and downstream dispersal. Fish passage through
the study area would not be certain in all years over the long term so fish access to improved habitat
throughout the river system might be impaired and Alternative 3 would not effectively support the
cumulative benefit, therefore, the impact is less than significant. Implementing the No-Project/No-Action
Alternative (Alternative 5) would not involve any activities to improve habitat quality and therefore would
not contribute to any long-term improvements for aquatic biological resources in Upper Truckee River; no
impact would occur.
Implementing action alternatives 1, 2 and 4 would result in channel improvements that would provide long-term
improvements to aquatic habitat conditions in the study area and would provide cumulative improvements to
habitat quality in the Upper Truckee River. Uncertainty regarding the time period required for formation of a
channel suitable for upstream fish passage and downstream dispersal exists under Alternative 3. Although
cumulative improvements to habitat quality in the study area and throughout the Upper Truckee River may still
occur, there is no guarantee of fish passage through the study area (particularly for mountain whitefish due to their
migration season) to access upstream habitats in the Upper Truckee River during low-flow periods.
Under existing conditions, aquatic habitat is of a marginal quality and continues to be impaired by the effects of
channel incision and widening, including increased deposition of fine sediment; low depth of flow, which results
in poor rearing habitat conditions during summer and limited passage in fall; poor substrate suitability, limited
stream margin or shallow water habitat during high flows; and increased turbidity during high-flow events.
Increased deposition of fine sediment and limited or poor substrate suitability affect habitat for most fish species
in the Upper Truckee River, as well as habitat for invertebrates (i.e., western pearlshell mussel) and
macroinvertebrates (e.g., mayflies, stoneflies, caddisflies). The project’s restoration actions, particularly
Alternatives 1, 2 and 4, would be beneficial to aquatic habitat for fish, invertebrates, and macroinvertebrates in the
Upper Truckee Marsh and would contribute to the following specific cumulative beneficial impacts:
►

►

►

►

Reduced bank erosion—Channel restoration would provide improved long-term stability of the channel,
reducing the processes of channel incision and bank failure as a source of fine sediment loading of the Upper
Truckee River. This would result in improvements in substrate conditions supporting fish, mussels, and
macroinvertebrates.
Decreased bed shear stress—Restoration actions would reduce bankfull channel capacity by raising the bed of
the existing channel or by constructing a new channel with a higher bed elevation relative to the existing
channel. The result would be decreased shear stress on the bed, which would improve habitat for aquatic
macroinvertebrates and fish by promoting a more geomorphically diverse bed.
Increased summer depth of flow—Restoration actions would result in improvements to the existing channel
or mostly new channels or channel segments that would have a bed elevation higher compared to the existing
channel. For Alternative 2, the restored channel would have greater depth of flow and improved fish access
from the lake into the river system. With a higher water level in the channel, more of the adjacent
groundwater supply would remain and be available to support stream flows later into summer. Under
Alternative 3, which relies on the natural formation of channels downstream of the proposed “pilot channel,”
the depth of flow advantage is uncertain in the marsh reach of the river where uncontrolled flow could result
in multiple smaller and shallower distributary channels.
Improved water quality (turbidity, temperature flux)—Reduction of suspended sediment sources would
reduce the level and/or duration of turbidity events and would improve habitat conditions in the bed of the
river, thereby improving macroinvertebrate, invertebrate, and fish habitats and therefore the populations that
can be supported in the study area. A narrower channel with increased depth of flow would also reduce the
diurnal thermal flux (gain and loss of heat) during the long, warm summer days or freezing winter nights by
providing more stable temperature conditions that would benefit fish and macroinvertebrates. Raised

groundwater levels could result in groundwater inflow into the channel later into summer and increased base
flow conditions. The added influx of cool groundwater would also serve to moderate temperatures.
►

►

Improved spawning habitat (decrease in fines, improved gravel resources)—The proposed restoration actions
would use gravel substrate in restored reaches that is designed to be of suitable size distribution for trout
spawning invertebrate production, and reintroduction of Lahontan Cutthroat Trout.
Improved lagoon and floodplain rearing habitat (floodplain inundation, summer base flow)—The proposed
restoration actions would improve floodplain connectivity and greatly increase the amount of shallow water
edge habitat under high-flow conditions compared to existing conditions. The proposed restoration actions
would restore the river-fed shallow lagoon areas. The expansion of shallow water habitats through proposed
restoration actions would assist in providing a basis for beneficial systemwide effects on the rearing success
of juvenile trout and native fishes. Such habitat improvements could benefit Lahontan cutthroat trout
reintroduction efforts if they occur in the future, consistent with TRPA objectives.

Because implementing any of the action alternatives would improve food production in the Upper Truckee River,
it could make a positive contribution to food resources available to fish using the Upper Truckee River. This
effect would be beneficial.
As mentioned above, given the design of Alternative 3 (i.e. natural formation of channels downstream of the
proposed “pilot channel”) there is the potential for disruption of upstream migrations and downstream dispersal
and guaranteed fish passage would not be possible in the long term. The spawning migration of at least one
species, mountain whitefish, could be adversely affected during low fall flows. Implementing the No-Project/NoAction Alternative (Alternative 5) would not result in a project-related long-term increase in Upper Truckee River
habitat quality. Under this alternative, habitat in the study area would not be improved, and no additional habitat
function is expected. Reasonably foreseeable restoration projects would improve habitat in some upstream reaches
of the Upper Truckee River. Therefore Alternative 5 would not contribute to cumulative effects on aquatic habitat.
Alternative 5 would make no contribution and therefore would have no impact.

Cumulative Fisheries—Long-Term Population Level Impacts on Western Pearlshell Mussels. The
action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) include construction activities that would affect the lowest reach of
the Upper Truckee River; however, the substrate conditions in this reach of the river are unsuitable for
western pearlshell mussels, which likely are not present or are present in only low numbers in this reach.
In addition, Environmental Commitment 7 would be implemented to address this species if it is present.
Therefore, none of the action alternatives would have a long-term effect on the population level of western
pearlshell mussels in this reach and thus would not contribute to a cumulative effect on the western
pearlshell mussel in the Upper Truckee River; this cumulative impact would be less than significant.
Implementing Alternative 5 would not result in any construction-related impacts and therefore would not
contribute to any long-term cumulative population level impacts on western pearlshell mussels in the
Upper Truckee River; no impact would occur.

The action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would result in channel improvements that would disrupt substrate and
potential mussel habitat in the Upper Truckee River. However, because the substrate in this part of the Upper
Truckee River is unsuitable for western pearlshell mussels, there would likely not be any individuals present during
construction. EC 7, “Prepare and Implement an Aquatic Species Rescue and Relocation Plan,” would be
implemented to detect and address this species if it is found. Even if present, they would likely be in very low
numbers and would therefore not contribute to a long-term population level impacts on western pearlshell mussels
and therefore no cumulatively significant adverse effects from the action alternatives.
The restoration actions associated with the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project would result in
improved habitat conditions consisting of a better diversity of substrates suitable for mussels and decreased bed
shear stress (Howard and Cuffey 2003, Strayer et al. 2004) within the project reach. Western pearlshell musse occur

in the Upper Truckee River (Conservancy and DGS 2007b). They are a large riverine mussel that was once common
to many of the larger salmon and trout streams throughout the northwest (Nedeau et al. 2005). In the Upper Truckee
River, the main population of western pearlshell mussels is located in Reaches 3–6; however, they are also found in
Reach 2 and may be present upstream in Lake Valley SRA. Mussels may be very patchy in their distribution, with
most of the population in relatively few, very dense beds (defined as more than 300 mussels in one gravel bar or
riffle). Dense beds have been documented in Reaches 3–6 of the Upper Truckee River. Abundance in other reaches
appears much lower. They have not been documented in the study area, but a standardized riverwide survey of the
western pearlshell mussel has not been conducted in the Upper Truckee River. The mussel is not a federal or state
special-status species, so there is no mandate to protect it.
Western pearlshell mussels are locally mobile and capable of recolonizing in suitable habitat (Conservancy and DGS
2007b). They reproduce and grow extremely slow, so it would probably take many decades for mussels to fully
recolonize restored habitats on their own. Implementing any of the action alternatives could affect individual
mussels, but this action would not adversely affect the population because it would not affect individuals upstream
of the Upper Truckee Marsh. Based on the very low abundance in the project area, the preconstruction survey and
relocation efforts to be conducted under EC 7, “Prepare and Implement an Aquatic Species Rescue and Relocation
Plan,” and the potential long-term beneficial effects on local habitat for this species, none of the action alternatives
would make a considerable contribution to an effect on long-term population levels. Reasonably foreseeable
restoration projects in Reaches 3 to 6 of the Upper Truckee River could place the core mussel populations for the
Upper Truckee River at risk. However, although implementing these projects would cause short-term disturbance,
each project has (Reaches 3 and 4) would (Reaches 5 and 6) implement well-designed relocation programs (the
project in Reaches 3 and 4 has been completed and mussels were successfully rescued and relocated); and they
would result in long-term improvements to aquatic habitats for western pearlshell mussels. Therefore, this impact
would be less than significant.
Implementing the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not result in long-term, project-related
impacts on population levels of western pearlshell mussels in the Upper Truckee River. Under this alternative, the
stream channel and associated substrate would not be disturbed. Already completed projects that rescued and
relocated Western pearlshell mussels and reasonably foreseeable restoration projects in Reaches 3 to 6 of the Upper
Truckee River could place the core populations for the Upper Truckee River at risk. However, although
implementing these projects would cause short-term disturbance, each project has (Reaches 3 and 4) and would
(Reaches 5 and 6) implement well-designed relocation programs; and they would result in long-term improvements
to aquatic habitats for western pearlshell mussels. Alternative 5 would make no contribution a cumulative impact;
however channel substrate would not be improved and therefore this impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.18-C18
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Fisheries—Long-Term Impacts of Aquatic Invasive Species to Aquatic Habitat in the
Upper Truckee River. The action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) include construction activities that would
affect the lowest reach of the Upper Truckee River and potentially introduce or spread invasive aquatic
plant and animal species (i.e., Eurasian watermilfoil, introduced sunfish, Asian clams, and bull frogs) into
or throughout the river channels in the Upper Truckee Marsh, including the Upper Truckee River and Trout
Creek. The Eurasian watermilfoil is of particular concern and is present in the project area and the Tahoe
Keys and has spread to other marinas or popular anchoring areas around Lake Tahoe by plant pieces
becoming fouled in boat ground tackle and establishing new colonies after anchors are re-set at new
locations. Construction activities could provide opportunities for invasive aquatic species to be moved on
boats, construction equipment, sampling gear, and personal equipment. Implementing Environmental
Commitment 4 would minimize the risk of spreading invasive plant and animal species, such as Eurasian
watermilfoil. Given these protection measures, this cumulative impact would be less than significant.
Implementing the No Project/No Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would involve no construction and
therefore not introduce construction related vectors that could spread invasive aquatic species. However,
other vectors to spread aquatic invasive species already occur in the Lake and associated water ways and
would continue to affect the spread of aquatic invasive species. Therefore, this impact would be less than
significant.

Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would involve construction in the vicinity of
existing water bodies (i.e., creek and river channel, sailing lagoon) where aquatic invasive species are present.
Implementation of EC 4, “Prepare and Implement and Invasive Species Management Plan,” would address
aquatic invasive species in the project area. This plan would involve taking measures to eliminate the adverse
effects of nonnative introduced and/or invasive aquatic plant and animal species (i.e., nonnative plants, nonnative
warm-water fish, and other invasive species) during project construction.
The objective of project activities linked to the aquatic invasive species management plan is to reduce threats to
native aquatic fauna and flora within the project area. The plan would be developed to be consistent with the State
of California’s Aquatic Species Management Plan (CDFG 2008), and would be completed, reviewed, and
approved by CDFG and TRPA prior to initiation of construction. A preconstruction survey would determine
whether any populations of invasive aquatic plants or animals are present in the project area. Aquatic habitat
within construction sites would be isolated prior to in-channel work. A qualified biologist(s), with expertise in
Tahoe basin aquatic plant and animal species, would be present during construction and would supervise the
removal and disposal of nonnative invasive species from the project area. All biologists working on this program
would be qualified to conduct nonnative aquatic species removal/disposal in a manner that would avoid and/or
minimize all potential risks to native aquatic species, particularly any special-status species potentially
encountered. Biologists would be on-site when work sites are isolated and/or dewatered, if necessary, in order to
capture, handle, and safely remove or dispose of any nonnative aquatic invasive species encountered. All
equipment entering the study area from areas suspected of harboring infestations by invasive aquatic plants or
areas of unknown infestation status would be cleaned of all attached substrate plant parts before being allowed
into the study area. All equipment used for in-channel work would be thoroughly cleaned prior to use on the
project and then be cleaned before leaving the site. This includes construction equipment, boats, kayaks, canoes,
fish nets and other fish sampling equipment, all water quality sampling and monitoring equipment, waders,
wading boots, and any other equipment that comes into contact with water or that may come in contact with
aquatic vegetation during project implementation.
This program would be closely coordinated with the Aquatic Species Rescue and Relocation Program, prepared
and implemented as EC 7, which is aimed at reducing the direct loss of native fish and desired sport fish (i.e.,
trout) and native mussels from impacts associated with construction of the project. Implementing EC 7 would
minimize stranding and mortality of these desirable species in the project area through rescue and relocation.
Reasonably foreseeable restoration projects would entail construction activities that could affect aquatic invasives
introduction or control on other reaches of the Upper Truckee River, but would be expected to implement
invasive species control and eradication measures. Existing nonconstruction-related vectors that result in the
establishment or spread of aquatic invasive species throughout the Upper Truckee River would continue. It is
possible that measures to eradicate and control invasives at the construction sites could provide a beneficial effect
where aquatic species have previously established. Therefore, implementing any of the action alternatives would
not result in a considerable contribution to effects on aquatic invasive species in the Upper Truckee River. The
contribution of any of the action alternatives to this cumulative impact would be less than significant.
Implementing the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not result in cumulative effects on
aquatic invasive species in the Upper Truckee River. Under this alternative, the water bodies within the project
reach would not be disturbed, so there would be no construction-related mobilization of invasive species.
Reasonably foreseeable restoration projects would entail construction activities that could affect aquatic invasive
species introduction or control on other reaches of the Upper Truckee River, but would be expected to implement
invasive species control and eradication measures. Existing and continuing non-construction related vectors that
result in aquatic invasive species’ establishment or spread throughout the Upper Truckee River would continue in
the absence of the project. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

IMPACT
3.18-C19
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Geology and Soils, Mineral Resources, and Land Capability and Coverage—
Construction-Related, Short-Term Increases in Soil Erosion, Sedimentation, and Loss of Topsoil.
Past actions that have disturbed natural vegetation or converted it to developed land uses have resulted in
erosion, sedimentation, and loss of topsoil. Implementing reasonably foreseeable projects and any of the
action alternatives could temporarily result in additional erosion, sedimentation, and loss of topsoil.
However, implementing Environmental Commitments 5, 6, and 8, planned as part of the action
alternatives, would minimize this short-term effect by implementing effective construction management
plans. Other reasonably foreseeable projects also would be required to implement BMPs and minimize
soil erosion, sedimentation, and loss of topsoil. Furthermore, many effects of the action alternatives and
reasonably foreseeable projects on erosion, sedimentation, or loss of topsoil (even in the event of BMP
failures) would be localized in their extent and unlikely to combine with the effects of other projects.
Therefore, when viewed in connection with the effects of other projects, the effects of the action
alternatives on soil erosion, sedimentation, and loss of topsoil would not be cumulatively considerable; this
cumulative impact would be less than significant. No construction would occur under the No-Project/NoAction Alternative (Alternative 5); however, erosion, sedimentation, and loss of topsoil would continue.
Therefore, the contribution of Alternative 5 to a cumulative impact would be less than significant.

Past actions that have converted natural vegetation to developed land uses or that have disturbed natural
vegetation have resulted in substantial erosion, sedimentation, and loss of topsoil in the watershed of the Upper
Truckee River. Reasonably foreseeable projects include erosion control projects that would reduce erosion,
sedimentation, and loss of topsoil but also include development and other projects that potentially could increase
these effects, at least temporarily during construction. For example, river restoration projects could temporarily
increase erosion, sedimentation, and topsoil loss during their construction.
Similarly, implementing any of the action alternatives of the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project
could temporarily increase erosion, sedimentation, and loss of topsoil during construction. All four action
alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would require construction in active stream channels and adjacent floodplains of
the study area. The extent of construction would depend on the restoration approach. Alternative 2 would disturb
the greatest acreage and Alternative 4 the least; Alternatives 1 and 3 would disturb comparable, intermediate
acreages.
As discussed in EC 5, “Prepare and Implement Effective Construction Site Management Plans to Minimize Risks
of Water Quality Degradation and Impacts to Vegetation,” EC 6, “Obtain and Comply with Federal, State,
Regional, and Local Permits,” and EC 8, “Prepare a Final Geotechnical Engineering Report, and Implement All
Applicable Recommendations,” all the action alternatives would incorporate construction site management plans
and vegetation protection and planting measures. These plans include many specific measures to be implemented
by the Conservancy and their contractors, including restricted disturbance areas and duration, BMPs that are
effective up to the 20-year precipitation event and 50-year streamflow event, discrete measures for subdrainage
areas, construction equipment and vehicle restrictions, specific winterization guidelines, protection for transported
and stored materials and debris, revegetation measures, topsoil salvaging, custom dewatering/bypassing plans,
rewetting requirements, and monitoring requirements regarding BMP performance and remedial action
requirements. These measures would limit the likelihood and magnitude of potential effects on erosion,
sedimentation, and loss of topsoil. Reasonably foreseeable projects would also be required to implement
comparable BMPs. Nonetheless, erosion, sedimentation, and loss of topsoil could occur during construction,
particularly in the event of BMP failures.
Reasonably foreseeable projects in the vicinity of the study area, including stream restoration projects along the
Upper Truckee River, could have active construction during overlapping periods and thus exposure to the same
large storm events, high flows, or both during intervening winters. The performance standards for BMPs on other
projects would be expected to be the same or similar as those planned for the action alternatives, but it is possible

that the BMPs could fail, particularly if unusual runoff conditions occur that exceed the BMP design capacity.
However, it is very unlikely that a BMP failure at one project site could combine with effects on erosion,
sedimentation, or loss of topsoil at other project sites because these failures would be localized in their extent.
Therefore, when viewed in connection with the effects of other projects, none of the action alternatives would
make a considerable contribution to the existing cumulative effect on erosion, sedimentation, and loss of topsoil;
this impact would be less than significant. No construction would occur under the No-Project/No-Action
Alternative (Alternative 5); however, erosion, sedimentation, and loss of topsoil would continue. Therefore,
Alternative 5 contribution to a cumulative impact would be less than significant.

Cumulative Geology and Soils, Mineral Resources, and Land Capability and Coverage—Land
Coverage Changes. Past actions have converted natural vegetation to developed uses, and increased
the coverage by impervious surfaces (land coverage) in the Upper Truckee River–Trout Creek watershed.
These changes have substantially altered geomorphic and hydrologic conditions of the most sensitive
lands in the lower portion of these watersheds. Reasonably foreseeable projects in the vicinity of the study
area would have individually varied effects on land coverage, but either these effects would be beneficial
or the projects would include mitigation to offset their adverse effects. Implementing any of the action
alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would decrease land coverage in the study area and in the sensitive lands
(LCD 1b) adjacent to the Upper Truckee River. In LCD 7, alternatives either would increase coverage but
not exceed allowable coverage or would reduce coverage. Therefore, none of the alternatives would
contribute to the existing cumulatively significant effect on land coverage; this impact would be less than
significant. No new development would occur under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5);
therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution and would have no impact.

In the past 150 years, some of the Upper Truckee River watershed has been converted to developed land uses
containing impervious surfaces (land coverage). Based on a review of land cover in the watershed (using the CAL
FIRE 2002 and California Interagency Watershed Mapping Committee 2004 GIS data layers), this portion is
about 9 percent, concentrated in the lower elevation areas of the watershed, and includes much of the project
vicinity. The land coverage associated with this urban development has substantially altered hydrologic,
geomorphic, and habitat conditions in the SEZs of the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek watershed. Past
projects that increased land coverage include the Lake Tahoe Golf Course, South Lake Tahoe Airport, U.S. 50,
and the Tahoe Keys Marina and residential and commercial areas in the watershed (e.g., Tahoe Keys, Al Tahoe,
or Highland Woods).
Reasonably foreseeable projects would have individually varied effects on coverage. Some projects may
potentially increase the amount of impervious surfaces (e.g., bike trails or development projects), others may
potentially decrease the amount of impervious surfaces (e.g., Elks Club, the Lake Tahoe Airport Runway
Restoration), and others may include no coverage changes (e.g., some restoration projects). Projects that would
increase the amount of impervious surfaces would also be required to incorporate mitigation to limit their
incremental contribution to the cumulative effect on coverage.
Implementing any of the action alternatives would be less than the allowable coverage on the Dillingham
settlement parcels and the other parcels in the study area regulated by Bailey’s land classification system. Because
the action alternatives would reduce land coverage in LCD 1b and coverage would be consistent with allowable
coverage throughout the study area, the project would not make a considerable contribution to the cumulative
impact on land coverage; this impact would be less than significant. No new development would occur under the
No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5); therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution and would
have no impact.

Cumulative Human Health/Risk of Upset—Potential Hazards to the Public from Use of Hazardous
Materials or Exposure to Existing On-Site Hazardous Materials. None of the action alternatives would
have a long-term effect on human health hazards from exposure to hazardous materials because following
project implementation, the land uses of the study area would be similar to current conditions. Mitigation
planned as part of Alternatives 1–3 include oversight, transport, and disposal procedures related to
encountering potential hazardous materials located at the TKPOA yard. There would be no change from
current conditions in the transport, use, release, or disposal of hazardous materials related to Alternative 4
and 5. Additionally, Environmental Commitment 9, planned as part of the alternatives, would further
reduce potential human health hazards through preparation of a health and safety plan and appropriate
noticing requirements, reducing this effect to a less-than-significant level. However, this would not
eliminate the risk of construction workers being exposed to hazardous materials. The remaining risk would
not contribute to a greater overall cumulative impact because other reasonably foreseeable construction
activities would not occur in the same place or at the same time and would be unlikely to concurrently
involve the same workers. Therefore, when viewed in connection with other projects, none of the action
alternatives would make a considerable contribution to potential hazards to the public from use of or
exposure to hazardous materials; this cumulative impact would be less than significant. No construction
would occur and land uses would be unchanged under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative
(Alternative 5); therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution and would have no impact.

The action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would have no short-term or long-term effect on human health hazards
from exposure to hazardous materials because following project implementation, the land uses of the study area
would be similar to current conditions, and there would be no change from current conditions in the transport, use,
release, or disposal of hazardous materials.
Mitigation Measures 3.7-2a and 3.7-2b planned as part of Alternatives 1-3 include oversight, transport, and
disposal procedures related to encountering potential hazardous materials located at the TKPOA yard. There
would be no change from current conditions in the transport, use, release, or disposal of hazardous materials
related to Alternatives 4 and 5. Additionally, EC 9, “Develop and Implement a Construction Management
Program” (Table 2-6), planned as part of the alternatives, would further reduce potential human health hazards
through preparation of a health and safety plan and appropriate noticing requirements reducing this effect to a
less-than-significant level. However, this would not eliminate the risk of construction workers being exposed to
hazardous materials. The Conservancy would review existing information on hazardous materials during design
development and implement avoidance and/or remediation measures, including preparing a site plan for each
construction phase that identifies any necessary remediation activities and notifying the appropriate agencies if
evidence of previously undiscovered soil or groundwater contamination is discovered. These measures would
reduce this effect to a less-than-significant level but would not eliminate the risk that construction workers would
be exposed to hazardous materials. However, the remaining risk would not contribute to a greater overall
cumulative impact because other reasonably foreseeable construction activities would not occur in the same place
or at the same time and would be unlikely to concurrently involve the same workers. Thus, in connection with
other projects, the action alternatives would not result in a considerable contribution to human health hazards
from exposure to hazardous materials; this cumulative impact would be less than significant.
Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5), there would be no short-term or long-term effect on
human health hazards from exposure to hazardous materials. Construction activities that could potentially expose
workers to hazardous materials would not occur; the land uses of the study area would be similar to current
conditions; and there would be no change in the transport, use, release, or disposal of hazardous materials.
Alternative 5 would make no contribution and therefore would have no impact.

Cumulative Human Health/Risk of Upset—Potential Increase in Public Health Hazards from
Mosquitoes Resulting from Increased Floodplain Inundation. Implementing any of the action
alternatives would result in more extensive floodplain inundation that could result in a greater abundance
of mosquitoes and thus a greater potential for exposing people to mosquito-borne viruses. However,
implementing Environmental Commitment 10, planned as part of the action alternatives, would limit
mosquito production in the study area to an amount comparable to or less than preproject (baseline)
conditions. Therefore, the action alternatives would not make a cumulatively considerable contribution to
effects on mosquito vector control and thus would not result in a cumulatively significant effect. This
impact would be less than significant. Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5), the
quality and extent of mosquito habitat in the study area would remain similar to baseline conditions;
therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution to a cumulative impact; however, mosquito production
would continue in the study area. This impact would be less than significant.

In the short term, implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would not increase the quality or
extent of mosquito breeding habitat and would not reduce the effectiveness of mosquito control efforts because
areas disturbed by construction activities would provide less suitable habitat for mosquito breeding than the river
channels, willow scrub-wet meadow, and other natural vegetation that currently exist at those sites.
Other restoration actions on the Upper Truckee River could contribute to a cumulative adverse effect on mosquito
vector control that could be additive with the effects of the project. However, in the long term, , implementing EC
10, “Establish and Implement a Management Agreement with the El Dorado County Vector Control District”
(Table 2-6), would limit mosquito production in the study area to an amount comparable to or less than preproject
(baseline) conditions. Therefore, implementing any of the action alternatives would not contribute to effects on
mosquito vector control; this impact would be less than significant.
Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5), it is anticipated that the quality and extent of
mosquito habitat in the study area would remain similar to baseline conditions and that the El Dorado County
Vector Control District would continue its control efforts in the study area. Therefore, Alternative 5 would not
contribute to a cumulative impact, however, mosquito production would continue in the study area. This impact
would be less than significant.

Airport, bird-aircraft collisions have not been occurring at the airport. Implementing reasonably foreseeable
projects would result in changes to a small amount of this habitat that would not attract additional wildlife
into the Critical Zone of the Lake Tahoe Airport. Under any of the action alternatives, additional habitat for
hazardous wildlife would be restored or enhanced in and near the approach/departure zone of the Lake
Tahoe Airport. This increase would be very small relative to the total amount of habitat. Also, the
Comprehensive Land Use Plan identifies restoration as a compatible land use for the approach/departure
zone. Therefore, the restoration and enhancement features of any of the action alternatives, in
combination with other reasonably foreseeable projects, would not attract significant additional wildlife into
the Critical Zone of the Lake Tahoe Airport. Implementing any of the action alternatives therefore would
not result in a considerable contribution to a cumulatively significant impact; this cumulative impact would
be less than significant. Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5), restoration and
enhancement of habitat would not occur. Alternative 5 would make no contribution to a cumulative impact;
however, reasonably foreseeable projects may enhance some existing habitat for hazardous wildlife, and
therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

The Critical Zone of the Lake Tahoe Airport encompasses the area within 10,000 feet of the airport operations area,
and a portion of the study area is located in this Critical Zone. The attraction of hazardous wildlife into the Critical
Zone can create airspace safety hazards because of the potential for bird-aircraft collisions. However, bird-aircraft
collisions have not been occurring at the Lake Tahoe Airport; therefore, there is not an existing safety hazard.
In the short-term, the noise and construction activity associated with implementing any of the action alternatives
(Alternatives 1-4) would reduce attraction of hazardous wildlife to the study area because of the commotion of
construction activity. Therefore, no contribution to cumulative wildlife hazards to aviation would occur.
The long-term cumulative impact issue is whether the contributions of the project and other foreseeable
restoration projects would increase wildlife hazards to aviation to a cumulatively significant level. In the Federal
Aviation Administration National Wildlife Strike Database and according to airport staff members, there are no
records of bird strikes (i.e., bird-aircraft collisions) at the Lake Tahoe Airport (CDM 2007). In addition, habitat
management, open space, recreational uses, and SEZ restoration are considered compatible land uses in the airport
Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CSLT 2007).
Several reasonably foreseeable river restoration projects would be located in or southwest of the Critical Zone,
including the Upper Truckee River Middle Reaches 1 and 2 SEZ and Wildlife Enhancement, Upper Truckee
Middle Reaches 3 and 4, Sunset Stables Restoration, and Upper Truckee River Restoration and Golf Course
Reconfiguration projects. These projects would generally include land cover types that provide habitat for
hazardous wildlife under existing conditions and would continue to provide habitat post-project. Other reasonably
foreseeable projects either would not affect habitat for hazardous wildlife or would cause small reductions in that
habitat. Therefore, reasonably foreseeable projects would not measurably increase the number of hazardous
wildlife attracted to the area.
In the long term, implementing Alternative 1, 2, or 3 could cause a small increase in habitat amount (and
potentially quality) by connecting the existing Sailing Lagoon to the Upper Truckee River. This restoration
feature would increase the area of the lagoon water surface during low lake levels and would increase breeding
habitat for waterfowl and other marsh-associated birds. In addition, Alternatives 1 and 2 also include the removal
of fill behind East Barton Beach to recreate lagoon and wet meadow conditions, which would also increase
habitat values for hazardous wildlife. These restoration features represent very small increases in the amount of
habitat available to hazardous wildlife in the vicinity of the Lake Tahoe Airport. Although a small portion of the
study area is located in the Critical Zone, the floodplain and lagoon restoration features identified for this area
would be located north of the Critical Zone. Restoring these features would not result in a detectable increase in
the numbers of wildlife moving through the Critical Zone.
Therefore, implementing any of the action alternatives in combination with other reasonably foreseeable projects
would not result in a cumulatively significant impact on aviation hazards; this cumulative impact would be less
than significant.
As described above, Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5), restoration and enhancement of
habitat would not occur. Alternative 5 would make no contribution to a cumulative impact; however, reasonably
foreseeable projects may enhance some existing habitat for hazardous wildlife and therefore this impact is less
than significant.

IMPACT
3.18-C24
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Hydrology and Flooding—Long-Term Increased Stormwater Runoff Volumes and
Long-Term Increased Peak Flows Generated. Project changes to impervious surface areas or
modifications to existing channels of the creeks, drainages, or the Upper Truckee River in the study area
would be localized and have stormwater runoff volume effects that are beneficial or have effects that could
be controlled on-site with design features planned as part of Environmental Commitment 11. The
stormwater runoff volume and peak flow effects could combine with other potential changes to stormwater
runoff generation or floodplain attenuation in the vicinity, but would not be cumulatively considerable on
their own, or in combination. The project’s contribution to this cumulative impact would be less than
significant. Because no construction would occur under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative
5), the extent of impervious surfaces in the study area would not increase and no channels would be
modified; therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution and would have no impact.

Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would not adversely affect the existing stormwater
generation in the study area; rather, it would have a beneficial effect. In compliance with existing CSLT and
TRPA requirements, Alternatives 1–4 would incorporate on-site stormwater controls for areas that would have
increased runoff under the alternative. The detention or infiltration facilities would be sized to accommodate the
entire 20-year, 1-hour storm runoff from each of the developed portions of the site; would convey runoff safely to
discharge points without erosion; and would be maintained over the life of the project. The planned controls
include providing on-site storm drainage facilities approved by the CSLT and TRPA that would identify the
location, size and type of facilities used to retain and treat the runoff volumes and peak flows to meet or surpass
preproject conditions. The stormwater designs would incorporate BMPs, such as pervious pavement or pavers,
bioswales and vegetated swales, constructed wetlands and detention ponds, rock-lined areas to prevent disruption
or erosion, and training of maintenance personnel on stormwater pollution prevention measures. In addition,
floodplain improvements that moderate runoff volumes and peak flows would be created under Alternatives 1-4.
These floodplain improvements would include measures such as direct removal of existing fill in the floodplain to
improve detention storage and storage of runoff entering the study area from surrounding local drainages and the
upstream watershed. These actions would be beneficial to both existing and future conditions.
Implementing any of the action alternatives would result in a decrease in existing coverage, and the proposed
coverage would be less than that allowed by TRPA regulations. Design requirements for the project and projects
upstream would limit increases in runoff resulting from changes in coverage relative to existing and future
conditions.
Reasonably foreseeable restoration projects in the vicinity would be either neutral or beneficial to stormwater
runoff volumes and peak flows because they would remove impervious surfaces and/or restore natural soil and
vegetation properties that better allow the infiltration of runoff. River and stream restoration projects in the Upper
Truckee River–Trout Creek watershed may also improve detention and overbank storage of runoff. However, the
adverse consequences of past actions in the local drainages and upstream watersheds would continue to contribute
runoff to the study area. Reasonably foreseeable erosion control projects in the vicinity would be either neutral or
beneficial to stormwater runoff and peak flow volumes because they would provide opportunities for detention
and infiltration. These actions would result in conditions similar to or better than existing conditions.
Reasonably foreseeable projects that would include changes in coverage and that might increase runoff would be
required to meet TRPA standards regarding the control of runoff volume and rate increases. Although hydrologic
effects in the local subwatersheds naturally combine downstream, changes to stormwater volume and peak flow
generation in the study area would have only limited potential to combine with other stormwater modifications in
the vicinity, and the changes would be small and difficult to discern. In addition, implementing EC 11,
“Incorporate Effective Permanent Stormwater Best Management Practices” (Table 2-6), would help to ensure that
on-site runoff would be infiltrated into the ground prior to discharging to surface waters. Therefore, implementing
any of the action alternatives would not make a considerable contribution to a potentially significant cumulative

effect on stormwater runoff volumes or peak flows generated or released downstream; this impact would be less
than significant.
Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5), no construction would occur; therefore, the extent of
impervious surfaces in the study area would not increase and no channels would be modified. For this reason,
Alternative 5 would make no contribution and therefore would have no impact.

Cumulative Hydrology and Flooding—Long-Term Increased 100-Year Flood Hazard Area or
Elevation. Project-generated changes to the existing channel (size, shape, or location) or to the floodplain
topographic surfaces and configurations in the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
regulatory floodway or floodplain would not result in a higher 100-year floodwater surface elevation or
enlarged 100-year floodplain under Alternative 1 or 4. Changes to the 100-year floodwater surface or
floodplain area under Alternative 2 or 3 could occur, but on-site design features planned for the
alternatives would avoid increased flood hazards or potential flood damage. The 100-year flood effects
from all the action alternatives would remain localized in the study area because of its downstream
location and the U.S. 50 bridge crossing upstream, which controls the rate of flow entering from upstream
reaches, even during a 100-year flood. Therefore, implementing any of the action alternatives would not
result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to effects on the 100-year flood hazard area or elevation;
this cumulative impact would be less than significant. The channel and floodplain would not be modified
under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5); however, existing flood hazards would remain.
This impact would be less than significant.

Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would maintain the existing 100-year floodplain
storage and flow routes in the study area, create minor improvements through removal of fill or net excavation
(Alternatives 1 and 4), or incorporate on-site design features to remain neutral and not increase risks from flood
hazard in the FEMA floodplain (Alternatives 2 and 3). The action alternatives include hydraulic modeling of the
proposed channel configuration at a detailed design level to identify modifications that would be incorporated into
final design to prevent the future 100-year water surface elevation from increases greater than one foot and prevent
any increase in flood elevation or inundation area that could increase flood hazards or potential damages to existing
structures, residences, or public infrastructure.
Reasonably foreseeable future restoration projects upstream on the Upper Truckee River would not be expected to
result in adverse changes to the 100-year floodplain storage capacity, flow routes, or boundaries. Several projects
have proposed alternatives that would remove previously placed fill and/or recontour areas in the existing 100-year
floodplain to provide minor incremental improvements to the existing degraded condition. Some of the proposed
alternatives for various projects may require incorporation of self-mitigating design features in final designs to meet
commitments of remaining neutral and not adversely affecting FEMA special hazard zones. The potential effects in
some project reaches could be noticeable if the existing floodplain is highly confined, but in the study area the
existing 100-year floodplain is already large and has a large storage volume, so changes are less likely to affect the
floodplain boundaries. The project changes in the study area would not be substantial on their own, and the upstream
constriction of the U.S. 50 bridge crossing would further limit the ability of project effects in the study area from
combining with effects from upstream reaches because the U.S. 50 bridge crossing would continue to control the
rate of flow into the study area and would control water surface elevations immediately upstream. Some of the
upstream reaches between constricting bridges (e.g., the middle reaches 1–6) might experience combined effects, but
those could not cause changes downstream in the study area. Therefore, implementing any of the action alternatives
would not make a considerable contribution to a potentially significant cumulative effect on 100-year flood hazard
area or elevation; this impact would be less than significant. The channel and floodplain would not be modified
under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) and would therefore not contribute to a cumulative
impact; however, existing flood hazards would remain. This impact would be less than significant.

(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Hydrology and Flooding—Long-Term Increased Overbanking during Small Flood
Events. Project changes to the size and configuration of the Upper Truckee River channel or floodplain in
the study area would produce beneficial increases in overbanking during small flood events under
Alternatives 1–4. The overbanking effects would produce a discernible beneficial effect on their own and
could combine with other potential improvements in overbanking processes from upstream projects. The
channel and floodplain would not be modified under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5)
and incised channel conditions would remain, limiting overbanking during small flood events. This impact
would be less than significant.

Implementing any of the four action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would decrease the capacity of the Upper
Truckee River channel, increase the length of appropriately sized channel, and enlarge the area inundated by the
two-year return interval flow (e.g., 760 cubic feet per second in the study area). Under the action alternatives,
channel and floodplain conditions would be modified substantially along the Upper Truckee River channel in the
study area to improve overbanking at specific streamflow magnitudes. There would be a substantial beneficial
effect relative to the existing condition, although it is uncertain whether possible adverse influences of climate
change would be fully offset. Changes to overbanking frequency in the study area, although measureable and
substantial under Alternatives 1–4, would not have a direct effect on overbanking conditions in other upstream
river reaches because of the natural downstream processes and because of the intervening hydraulic controls of
the upstream U.S. 50 bridge and road fill across the active floodplain.
Reasonably foreseeable river restoration projects on the Upper Truckee River have alternatives under
consideration that would also decrease channel capacity and increase overbank flooding for small flood events
and would improve channel and floodplain relationships relative to the existing degraded condition along their
respective project reaches. Direct benefits to overbanking would be largely limited to each project area because
flows would often return to the channel from the floodplain, particularly where road fill, bridges, or both limit
down-valley floodplain continuity. The benefits in the study area that would result from implementing one of the
action alternatives would additively combine with the benefits of other projects upstream, but changes in the study
area would not directly enhance overbanking and the active floodplain upstream. Increased overbanking upstream
of the study area resulting from implementation of other foreseeable projects might alter the flood hydrographs
and incrementally reduce the magnitude of the benefits of increased overbanking in the study area. However, the
overall effects of increased overbanking along the Upper Truckee River would still be beneficial. The channel
and floodplain would not be modified under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) and incised
channel conditions would remain, limiting overbanking during small flood events. This impact would be less than
significant.

Cumulative Hydrology and Flooding—Long-Term Modified Groundwater Levels and Flow Patterns.
Project-generated changes to the size, shape, or location of existing river channels, the size, elevation, or
frequency of inundation of lagoons and increased overbanking and active floodplain area under
Alternatives 1, 2, and 3 would result in beneficial changes to groundwater levels and flows in the study
area. The potential benefits could be substantial on their own in the study area and would add to the
beneficial effects of similar restoration projects upstream by supporting groundwater levels in the study
area. Alternative 4 would not change the groundwater levels or flow patterns from existing condition in the
majority of the area (outside of the inset floodplain); therefore, this cumulative impact would be less than
significant. The channel would not be modified and surface connections and subsurface conditions
around the channels and lagoons would not be changed under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative
(Alternative 5); therefore, groundwater levels would not benefit. Alternative 5 would not contribute to this
beneficial effect. This impact would be less than significant. .

Implementing Alternative 1, 2, or 3 would result in net improvements to groundwater levels and patterns of flow
in the study area relative to existing degraded conditions. The location and magnitude of benefit would differ
among alternatives. It is uncertain whether implementing Alternative 1, 2, or 3 would fully compensate for the
possible adverse influences of climate change. The effects of implementing any of the action alternatives on

groundwater in the study area could be measureable and generally beneficial but would be localized and
transitory. The expected changes would affect only the unconfined uppermost water-bearing zone.
Implementing Alternative 4 would not substantially modify the groundwater conditions in the study area (outside
of the new inset floodplain) relative to existing degraded conditions. The construction of Alternative 4 would
mimic a possible future geomorphic state with an active floodplain inset in a widened stream corridor. This design
would result in groundwater levels and flow paths that could be similar to the existing condition. Any changes
would be localized and would not substantially affect regional groundwater conditions, this cumulative impact
would be less than significant.
Other restoration projects along the Upper Truckee River could incrementally improve (i.e., increase)
groundwater levels and incrementally improve down-valley groundwater connectivity between adjacent reaches.
Restoration project alternatives that would raise streambed elevations and expand groundwater storage capacity in
the replaced (backfilled) valley floor materials might provide minor incremental benefits to adjacent downstream
locations by increasing groundwater levels, increasing storage volumes, and decreasing losses to surface water
upstream. Projects that would improve groundwater levels upstream in the Upper Truckee River–Trout Creek
watershed could incrementally and locally improve recharge potential in the watershed and between the upstream
reaches and the study area. Proposed erosion control and water quality projects and other enhancement and
restoration projects in the local drainages and upstream watersheds would involve site-specific restoration or
enhancement of surface water features. These features may control peak-flow hydrology in ways that also
improve groundwater recharge potential. To the degree that groundwater recharge is improved in dispersed areas
of the groundwater basin, incremental benefits to recharge, total storage, and long-term groundwater support to
the stream corridors and the study area may result. The detention of peak flows provided by proposed stormwater
treatment facilities might help to counteract reduced opportunities for groundwater recharge that would result
from climate change, which is expected to increase rainfall runoff relative to snowmelt runoff. The effects on
groundwater conditions from erosion control and water quality projects would be beneficial relative to the
existing condition. The study area’s location downstream of other reasonably foreseeable restoration projects
suggests that the localized and transitory effects in the study area would have a limited ability to combine with the
effects of actions upstream, but the study area’s benefits would be in addition to those of the upstream reaches and
would support improved groundwater discharge through the study area to the lake. This effect would be
beneficial.
The channel would not be modified and surface connections and subsurface conditions around the channels and
lagoons would not be changed under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5); therefore,
groundwater levels would not benefit. Alternative 5 would not contribute to this beneficial effect. This impact
would be less than significant.

Cumulative Geomorphology and Water Quality—Short-Term Risk of Surface Water and
Groundwater Degradation during Construction. Project construction activities would occur along or in
the channel of the Upper Truckee River, in Trout Creek, in the Sailing Lagoon, and near the shoreline of
Lake Tahoe under the action alternatives. Although temporary BMPs would be developed as part of
Environmental Commitments 5 and 6, short-term risk of water quality degradation during construction
could occur during summer construction seasons or intervening winters. Short-term turbidity that
potentially impairs noncontact recreation beneficial uses (i.e., aesthetics) would be minimized by
environmental commitments planned as part of the alternatives development. The residual impact would
be minor under the action alternatives but could violate water quality standards of the Basin Plan,
including the turbidity standard (<10 percent above background). If similar impacts occurred under
reasonably foreseeable projects at the same time, the effects could combine downstream to increase the
magnitude or duration of the water quality standard violation. Although the joint probability of concurrent
failures of BMPs, given the high anticipated performance standards and short overlapping periods of
construction, would be extremely remote, if it occurred, the combined effect would be cumulatively
significant. The project could result in a considerable contribution to the combined, significant cumulative

adverse effects related to violation of a water quality standard. This cumulative impact would be
significant. Because no construction would occur under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative
5), the Basin Plan’s turbidity standard would not be violated; therefore, Alternative 5 would make no
contribution and would have no impact.
All four action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would require active construction upslope of, near, or in active
stream channels and adjacent to the shoreline of Lake Tahoe, the Tahoe Keys Marina, and other surface water
bodies and groundwater recharge areas. Although temporary BMPs would be implemented, short-term risk of
water quality degradation during construction could occur. EC 5, “Prepare and Implement Effective Construction
Site Management Plans to Minimize Risks of Water Quality Degradation and Impacts to Vegetation,” described
in Table 2-6, would be implemented under all the action alternatives. The planned controls include many specific
measures to be implemented by the Conservancy, including restricting the extent of the areas disturbed and the
duration of disturbance; implementing BMPs that are effective up to the 20-year precipitation event and 50-year
streamflow event, discrete measures for various subdrainage areas on each side of each water body, and
construction equipment and vehicle restrictions; implementing specific winterization guidelines; protecting
transported and stored materials and debris; implementing custom dewatering/bypassing plans and rewetting
requirements; and monitoring water quality, BMP effectiveness, and remedial action requirements. The controls
would limit the likelihood and magnitude of potential short-term water quality degradation that could result in
persistent turbidity above background that would impair beneficial uses. EC 6, “Obtain and Comply with Federal,
State, Regional, and Local Permits,” also would be implemented. However, the potential for violations of
narrative or numerical water quality standards of the Water Quality Control Plan for the Lahontan Region (Basin
Plan), at least for short periods, cannot be feasibly eliminated.
The reasonably foreseeable stream restoration projects along the Upper Truckee River are in contiguous reaches
upstream of the study area. They could have active construction over the next several years and exposure to high
flows during intervening winters. Each proposed restoration project would be required to take many measures to
reduce the potential risk of short-term water quality degradation, including:
►

►

restricting the area and duration of construction disturbance to the absolute minimum necessary and
designing, installing, and maintaining temporary BMPs to protect disturbed areas and minimize soil erosion,
prevent surface runoff interaction with disturbed surfaces, and limit the potential for release of sediment,
nutrient, or otherwise contaminated water from entering water bodies outside the construction disturbance
zone.

The performance standards for BMPs on other projects would be expected to be the same as those identified in the
environmental commitments, but it remains possible that the BMPs could experience failure, particularly if
unusual runoff or streamflow conditions occur that exceed the BMP design capacity. The Upper Truckee River
has no dams or other flow-regulation facilities, and it is not possible to predict weather and runoff conditions
before the onset of construction, especially construction that occurs over more than one season. The projects
would all be located along the same unregulated river, and all would be scheduled without advanced prediction of
future storm events. If a storm event created conditions in the watershed that overwhelmed temporary BMPs at
one project site, BMPs for other projects concurrently in active construction also could fail. The exposure would
largely be related to sediment from disturbed or revegetated surfaces that are present on-site over winter, rather
than other type of potential pollutants that would be present during active summer construction seasons. The
concurrent exposure to the same impact mechanism produces a potential adverse cumulative impact involving
storm damage in one construction reach influencing BMP performance in other, downstream reaches. However,
the BMP performance standards would be expected to be relatively high (i.e., 20-year precipitation event, 50-year
streamflow event) relative to the short time frame of overlapping construction for multiple project reaches (i.e.,
likely just days or weeks within the years of active construction).

The probability that the BMPs of multiple projects would concurrently fail would be extremely remote. However,
the potential for violations of narrative or numerical water quality standards of the Basin Plan, including the
turbidity standard, cannot be feasibly eliminated, although inclusion of BMPs would substantially reduce impacts
so aesthetics or other beneficial uses would not be affected. Thus, the cumulative risk of violating a water quality
standard would be substantial, and the project’s contribution to this cumulative impact would be considerable; this
cumulative impact would be significant.
All feasible mitigation measures to avoid or further reduce the short-term risk of surface water and groundwater
degradation during construction under Alternatives 1-4 would be expected to be incorporated into the individual
restoration project plans and construction BMPs for specific projects. Additional feasible mitigation is not
available to reduce this impact to less than significant, so the residual impact would be cumulatively significant
and unavoidable.
Because no construction would occur under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5), the Basin
Plan’s turbidity standard would not be violated; therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution and would
have no impact.

(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Geomorphology and Water Quality—Short-Term Risk of Surface Water and
Groundwater Degradation Following Construction. Project implementation would include channel
sections that need periods of channel adjustment following construction to meet final design (Alternatives
1 and 3), areas of reseeded native species on active floodplains and biotechnical streambank treatments
(all action alternatives) that could be vulnerable to a large flood within the first few years following
construction. Potential reductions in coarse sediment delivery downstream, generation of fine sediment
related to adjustments to the channel bed and banks, mobilization of fine sediment and organic matter on
reactivated floodplains, and flood damage that could result in persistent or chronic water quality
degradation would be reduced by design elements planned as part of the alternatives. The residual
impacts would be minor under the action alternatives but could still violate water quality standards, and if
similar impacts occurred at other project sites during the same period, effects could combine to increase
the magnitude or severity of a water quality impact. In the short term, implementing any of the action
alternatives could result in a considerable contribution to effects on surface water; this cumulative impact
would be significant. Implementing the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not require
construction activities and thus would not require a period of channel adjustments following construction to
meet final design; however, existing oversteepend banks and incised channel conditions would remain.
This impact would be less than significant.

Geomorphic adjustments would occur after construction of any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) as part
of the normal response to the new dimensions, materials, and hydraulics of constructed and/or reactivated
channels and floodplains. In particular, implementation of Alternatives 1 and 3 would feature channel sections
that would require periods of channel adjustment following construction to meet final design, including net
aggradation (e.g., deposition of coarse sediment), bed mobilization to redistribute materials, and (in the case of
Alternative 3) natural processes to reoccupy remnant channel sections throughout the floodplain. These
adjustments would most likely occur during and just following peak seasonal streamflows. The probability that
project-related turbidity impacts would be substantially worse than under the existing flows, that they would
extend outside the treatment reach, and that they would impair beneficial uses during the channel adjustment
flows would be low.
Implementation of any action alternative would include revegetation of modified floodplain areas (excavated inset
floodplains/lowered terraces) and/or re-activation of floodplain surfaces that have been dormant and collecting
sediment and organic matter. Under all of the action alternatives, biotechnical streambank protections would be
installed that might not achieve maximum hydraulic resistance or geotechnical strength within five years of
construction. A large flood (i.e., 25-year or greater) occurring within the first few years of construction could
produce erosion and sedimentation in the modified channels and/or floodplain that degrades water quality, at least

for short periods (potentially hours, days, or, at most, weeks). Although the same flood event could also result in
potential water quality degradation under existing conditions, the project activities may alter the location, extent,
and duration of impacts. Fine sediment and organic matter mobilization in newly reactivated floodplain areas
would be minimized by design elements of Alternative 3. Possible channel and floodplain damage that could
result in persistent or chronic water quality degradation in the study area would be reduced by mitigation planned
as part of all action alternatives (Mitigation Measure 3.9-2 [Alts. 1-4]) to address issues during the interim period
after construction. The residual impacts of the action alternatives could be substantial on their own.
The reasonably foreseeable stream restoration projects on the Upper Truckee River are in contiguous reaches
upstream of the study area, and although each restoration project is expected to take many measures to reduce
potential effects during construction, post-construction mitigation measures for each project have not yet been
determined. Some of the alternatives for various reaches include the need for post-construction natural channel
adjustments, and all the projects likely include channel, bank, or floodplain treatments that may not reach full
geotechnical or hydraulic resistance within the first couple of years. The projects would all be located along the
same unregulated river, and if a large flood occurred within the first few years of construction, it could affect
multiple project reaches, combining to increase the potential magnitude or duration of effect and/or causing a
channel response that eventually affects more than one reach. During an interim period of five years following
construction, the probability of damage from a large flood (e.g., 25-year recurrence or larger) is relatively high
because it would be the additive probability of the same statistical chance for each year and for each project.
Therefore, such an event could be reasonably expected. Overall, the potential for water quality degradation during
such an event for the restored condition on multiple project reaches would likely be less than during a flood in the
existing degraded channel due to lowered bank heights and reduced channel slopes expected for the restored
condition compared the existing degraded channel. Furthermore, a large flood event would have naturally high
background turbidity levels. However, locally worse conditions and/or flood damage that could pose a risk of
becoming persistent or chronic might result under the action alternatives and other reasonably foreseeable
restoration projects. Additionally, violations of the strict water quality standards could occur even if similar
effects may result under the No- Project/No-Action Alternative. Therefore, implementing the action alternatives
would make a considerable contribution to a potentially significant cumulative impact; this impact would be
significant.
Implementing the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not require construction activities and
thus would not require a period of channel adjustments following construction to meet final design; however,
existing oversteepend banks and incised channel conditions would remain. This impact would be less than
significant.
Mitigation Measure 3.18-C29: Implement an Interim Coordinated Adaptive Management Plan on the Upper
Truckee River.
The sponsors (landowners/funders) for all the foreseeable river restoration projects that would be constructed on
the Upper Truckee River shall develop and implement an interim coordinated adaptive management plan focused
on potential short-term water quality degradation that may result if unexpectedly large flood flows occur within
the first five years after construction. The plan shall be jointly developed to address issues that cross project
boundaries and look at the system as a whole. The plan shall be in force for the interim period of channel
adjustment and initial flood vulnerability (i.e., at least five years but no more than ten years from the end of
construction—potentially as long as needed to allow for expected natural channel adjustments).
The plan shall identify specific data collection and monitoring protocols, describe decision-making processes and
authorities, and advise on corrective actions. The performance criteria for the corrective actions shall focus on
preventing damage or turbidity effects from becoming a persistent, recurring, or chronic source, whether the
corrective action is needed at the initial damage site or at other location(s) that could be affected by channel
response to the initial damage. The plan shall include a discussion of responsibilities for implementing corrective
actions, with a starting assumption that each project sponsor would be financially responsible for implementing

reaches and that the group will decide, following review of monitoring data, that mitigation should be applied in a
reach different from the one where the problems are initially observed to prevent future or chronic water quality
effects.
With implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.18-C29 under Alternatives 1-4, the likelihood and potential
magnitude of Impact 3.18-C29 would not be considerably worse than under existing conditions; however, the
residual effects could still result in violations of water quality standards. Therefore, Impact 3.18-C29 would be
significant and unavoidable.
IMPACT
3.18-C30
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Geomorphology and Water Quality—Long-Term Stream Channel Erosion. Under any of
the action alternatives, changes to the channel of the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek would result in
stream channel erosion effects that are generally beneficial in most of the study area while creating
localized erosion that could be controlled by Environmental Commitments 5, 6, and 11 planned as part of
the alternatives. The stream channel erosion benefits would be considerable on their own and could
combine with other potential reductions of erosion along the Upper Truckee River in upstream restoration
reaches by preventing upstream migration of channel instability. Therefore, the effect would be beneficial
on its own and would result in a considerable contribution to a cumulatively beneficial effect on stream
channel erosion; this cumulative effect would be beneficial. Implementing the No-Project/No-Action
Alternative (Alternative 5) would allow the adverse conditions in the Upper Truckee River channel and the
Trout Creek channel in the study area to persist, but this would not be a change from existing conditions;
therefore, this cumulative impact would be less than significant.

Implementing any of the action alternatives would reduce stream channel erosion in the study area relative to
existing conditions, resulting in substantial overall benefits. Under the action alternatives, the Upper Truckee
River channel in the study area would be repaired, restored, and/or reconstructed, which would directly reduce
rates of erosion relative to the degraded existing condition. Compiling the total maximum daily load (TMDL)
streambank erosion results (California Water Boards and NDEP 200) for specific subreaches of the Upper
Truckee River allows a quantitative estimate of the effect of the action alternatives on stream channel erosion
(Table 3.18-4). The four action alternatives propose varied restoration approaches and designs in the study area.
However, the estimated reduction in loads of fine sediment from streambank erosion in the study area varies by
only ten cubic yards among the alternatives (Appendix I). These data indicate that implementing any of the action
alternatives would reduce loads of fine sediment from streambank erosion in the study area by nearly 60 percent
(reduced to 220.55 cubic yards from 538.13 cubic yards under the existing conditions). The potentially significant
local erosion impacts of each action alternatives would be controlled through design elements and EC 5, 6, and 11
planned as part of each action alternative. The planned controls include providing channel bed and bank
stabilization at and immediately upstream of the river mouth and changed Sailing Lagoon connection, and
ensuring bed and bank stability in lower Trout Creek. The dominant long-term project effect of any action
alternative would be beneficial.
The study area is a small portion of the entire 15 miles of TMDL study reaches, and the proposed action
alternatives alone would reduce the entire Upper Truckee River’s channel erosion load of fine sediment from
streambanks by about seven percent relative to existing conditions. Although small, this would be a considerable
and measureable benefit relative to the degraded existing condition. Other reasonably foreseeable restoration
projects in the watershed would also repair, restore, and/or reconstruct portions of the Upper Truckee River
channel and would be expected to have a beneficial long-term overall effect on stream channel erosion rates. It is
expected, for example, that any potential localized increase in erosion risks in their study areas or adverse effects
on immediate upstream or downstream reaches would be controlled through design and implementation of onsite, project-specific mitigation measures.

If the action alternatives and the other foreseeable Upper Truckee River restoration projects were all implemented,
the load of fine sediment from streambanks would be reduced to about 2,177.19 to 2,444.94 cubic yards,
depending on the alternatives selected for other upstream project reaches (Table 3.18-4). This would represent a
substantial measureable benefit, reducing the entire Upper Truckee River’s load of fine sediment from streambank
erosion by 43.4 to 51.0 percent relative to the existing degraded conditions. It is uncertain whether these measures
would fully compensate for possible adverse influences of climate change. Benefits of these channel
modifications would be substantial relative to existing conditions but would be largely limited to each respective
project area. Minor interaction and combining benefits between reaches would be expected where project changes
in one reach could protect channel stability of adjacent upstream reaches and tributaries. Because of the study
area’s downstream position, implementing the action alternatives alone would not be expected to directly or
indirectly reduce channel erosion along the Upper Truckee River upstream.
The TMDL analysis of load reduction opportunities (California Water Boards and NDEP 2008:211–215)
produced quantitative estimates of erosion of fine sediment from streambanks of the Upper Truckee River under
the existing condition and for a range of treatments to reduce streambank erosion. Compiling the results for
specific subreaches of the Upper Truckee River allows a quantitative estimate of the effect of foreseeable projects
on stream channel erosion (Table 3.18-5). The TMDL analysis looked at three tiers of treatment types: Tier 1,
Restoration; Tier 2, Mixed Treatment; and Tier 3, Bank Protection. Final designs have not yet been selected for
some of the foreseeable stream and river restoration projects upstream of the study area, and a range of
alternatives is still being considered for some of these projects. However, most of the projects are focused on full
restoration and mixed treatment approaches, so the results compiled in Table 3.18-5 reflect those TMDL
treatment tiers. These data indicate that implementing other foreseeable actions throughout the adjacent upstream
reaches of the Upper Truckee River would potentially reduce loads of fine sediment from the Upper Truckee
River by 1,557.2 to 1,825.0 cubic yards, which equates to a reduction of 36.1 to 42.3 percent of the total under the
No-Project/No-Action Alternative without any other foreseeable actions. This would be a substantial benefit
relative to the existing degraded condition.
Reasonably foreseeable erosion control projects in the vicinity would be neutral or beneficial because they would
control runoff volumes and regulate peak flows in the contributing subwatersheds. Other foreseeable projects
include a range of projects that have individually varied effects on runoff. Some projects may potentially increase
runoff from increased impervious surfaces (e.g., bike trails, development projects) or reduced vegetation cover
(e.g., fuel reduction projects); others may potentially decrease runoff from decreased impervious surfaces (e.g.,
Lake Tahoe Boulevard Enhancement, Lake Tahoe Airport Runway Restoration). Foreseeable projects that would

increase the extent of impervious surfaces would be required to incorporate mitigation to limit their incremental
contribution. A measureable beneficial effect of smaller erosion control and other projects would be difficult to
discern because the projects focus on controlling runoff for small to moderate events, which are less likely to
cause erosion in the main stream channel.
Reductions of stream channel erosion in the study area would be additive with other stream channel erosion
reductions in terms of total long-term benefit along the entire Upper Truckee River, but changes in the study area
would not directly improve channel erosion upstream. Because of the location of the study area, improvements in
the channel stability would combine with other actions only by preventing channel instability from migrating
further upstream. Therefore, the effect would be beneficial.
Implementing the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would allow the adverse conditions in the
Upper Truckee River channel and the Trout Creek channel in the study area to persist, but this would not be a
change from existing conditions; therefore, this cumulative impact would be less than significant.
IMPACT
3.18-C31
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Geomorphology and Water Quality—Long-Term Fine Sediment and Nutrient Retention.
Project changes to the channel capacity, elevation, the frequency of overbanking, and the area of
functional active floodplain and lagoon in the study area would produce beneficial increases in fine
sediment and nutrient retention during small to moderate flood events under any of the action alternatives.
The fine sediment and nutrient retention effects would produce a discernible beneficial effect on their own
and could combine with other potential improvements in floodplain processes upstream to reduce
sediment and nutrients delivered to Lake Tahoe. This cumulative effect would be beneficial. Implementing
the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would allow the existing impaired fine sediment and
nutrient retention conditions to persist. This impact would be less than significant.

Implementing any of the action alternatives would decrease the Upper Truckee River channel capacity, increase
the length of appropriately sized channel, remove floodplain fill, restore lagoon area, and enlarge the area
inundated by the two-year return interval flow (e.g., 760 cubic feet per second in the study area). These changes
would result in a substantial improvement to overbanking at specific streamflow magnitudes in the study area.
The area of active floodplain would be enlarged, and the length of channel with overbanking would increase,
allowing more opportunities for low-velocity, shallow flooding that retains fine sediment and supports vegetation
uptake of nutrients. In the absence of empirical data or calibrated models to estimate potential quantities of fine
sediment and nutrients trapped by floodplain processes, the area inundated by frequent small streamflow events
(i.e., the two-year recurrence) under any of the action alternatives is presented as a proxy for comparison

although measureable and considerable under the action alternatives, would not contribute to floodplain process
changes in other adjacent river reaches because of limited natural upstream effects and the intervening hydraulic
controls of the upstream U.S. 50 bridge and road fill across the active floodplain.

Reasonably foreseeable river restoration projects on the Upper Truckee River have alternatives under
consideration that would also improve floodplain retention of sediment and nutrients for small and moderate flood
events, relative to the existing degraded condition along their respective project reaches. Final designs have not
yet been determined for some of the proposed stream and river restoration projects upstream, and a range of
alternatives are still being considered for some of these projects. Some alternatives along some subreaches of the
proposed future restoration projects on the Upper Truckee River might reduce stream-erosion sediment sources
while making only very minor improvements to overbanking frequency or the area of floodplain (e.g., the bank
stabilization alternative for the Upper Truckee River Restoration and Golf Course Reconfiguration Project).
However, the opportunity for floodplain processes to provide water quality treatment would be substantially
improved along the Upper Truckee River relative to the degraded existing conditions (see areas listed in Table
3.18-6). Improving floodplain function in particular reaches would incrementally reduce loads conveyed farther
downstream, and opportunities might improve for any overbanking in those downstream reaches (including the
study area) to trap additional net sediment and nutrients before discharge of the river to the lake. Substantial
benefits could result, although it is uncertain whether possible adverse influences of climate change would be
fully offset by the implemented action alternatives for the cumulative river restoration projects. Direct benefits to
sediment and nutrient retention would be largely limited to each project area because return flows back from the
floodplain to channel would occur, particularly where road fill and/or bridges limit down-valley floodplain
continuity. However, between existing bridges, it is possible that benefits of improved floodplain connectivity
between adjacent reaches may result. The benefits in the study area that would result from implementing any of
the action alternatives would add to benefits of other restoration projects upstream to reduce fine sediment and
nutrients delivered to Lake Tahoe. The combined effect of the proposed restoration projects would be beneficial.
Implementing the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would allow the existing impaired fine
sediment and nutrient retention conditions to persist. This impact would be less than significant.

3.18-C32
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Geomorphology and Water Quality—Long-Term Modifications in Transport of Coarse
Sediment to Upper Truckee River and Effects on Beach Processes. Project-generated changes to the
channel bed profile, bank and bed materials, or the hydraulic conditions controlling bedload (i.e., sands
and gravel) transport could worsen under Alternative 1, 2, or 3 relative to the effects of historically
declining watershed coarse sediment yield on channel erosion and beach erosion adjacent to the river
mouth (i.e., at Cove East and Barton Beach), or they could remain similar to existing conditions under
Alternative 4. Potential effects of the project could be considerable and could combine with effects of other
actions on coarse sediment transport and delivery, but because of highly uncertain climate change
influences, especially on beach erosion, the incremental or combined consequences to channel and
beach erosion are not predictable. Conditions could range from worse than the existing degraded
condition to a possible improvement regardless of coarse sediment delivery changes, and after thorough
investigation, the determination for all alternatives, including the No-Project/No-Action Alternative
(Alternative 5), remains too speculative for a meaningful significance conclusion.

Implementing Alternative 1, 2, or 3 would result in modifications to the channel bed profile, bank and bed
materials, and the hydraulic conditions controlling bedload (i.e., sands and gravel) transport in the study area and
into the mouth of the Upper Truckee River, at least for an interim period of geomorphic adjustment following
construction. Under Alternative 3, major modifications would be made to potential low-flow connectivity in the
marsh through the lagoon system and would anticipate net sedimentation of coarse sediment over the long term.
This could limit transport from upstream sources through the study area to the lake. Under Alternative 4, no
modifications would be made to the bed profile, and bed and bank erosion that could reduce local sources of
coarse sediment would be limited; however, transport of coarse sediment from upstream sources through the
study area to the mouth of the river would not be limited. Given the background of naturally declining watershed
coarse sediment yield and ongoing channel and beach erosion, adverse changes in the project reach could worsen
the existing degraded condition.
Impacts of the project could combine with the potential coarse sediment effects of other reasonably foreseeable
future restoration projects upstream on the Upper Truckee River to increase the potential risk of erosion
consequences in study area channel reaches and along the beach. Although the performance goals of the proposed
restoration projects would be focused on reducing human-induced excessive erosion, some of the treatment
approaches and channel designs might also further reduce the supply of coarse sediment generated by streambed
or streambank erosion. Implementing the projects would not modify coarse sediment sources along the river
upstream of Meyers, but it could reduce the downstream delivery of coarse sediment relative to existing
conditions because it would create additional opportunities for in-channel and floodplain sedimentation.
Implementing foreseeable erosion control and water quality projects in the local drainages and upstream
watersheds would involve installing measures designed to detain runoff and capture fine sediment. Although the
performance goals would be focused on treating fine sediment, nutrient, and other urban pollutant loads, many of
the methods and facilities would inadvertently trap coarse sediment. Coarse sediment captured in stormwater
facilities would likely be removed under normal maintenance practices. This could create a minor but potentially
measureable decrease in coarse sediment delivery to downstream receiving waters.
For the long term, highly uncertain climate change influences might overwhelm the possible long-term effects of
any action. It is possible that climate change may exacerbate impacts (e.g., further decrease coarse sediment
delivery) or counteract them (e.g., lower lake levels, reducing beach erosion). Given the uncertainty of current
scientific understanding related to future climate change–and related baseline conditions, the determination of
project-specific effects and potential cumulative impacts for all alternatives, including the No-Project/No-Action
Alternative (Alternative 5), remains too speculative for a meaningful significance conclusion.

IMPACT
3.18-C33
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Land Use—Potential to Physically Divide an Established Community or Conflict with
Land Use Plans, Policies, or Regulations. Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4)
would not physically divide an established community; the public access components of these alternatives
would increase connectivity between established communities. In addition, implementing alternatives 2, 3,
and 4 would not conflict with applicable plans, policies, or regulations, including any habitat conservation
plans or natural community conservation plans. Thus, when viewed in connection with other projects,
implementing any of the action alternatives would not make a considerable contribution to effects on
California State Lands Commission policies and regulations regarding use of public trust lands along the
Upper Truckee River; would not contribute to conflicts with other land use plans, policies, or regulations;
and would not physically divide an established community. The project’s contribution to this cumulative
impact would be less than significant. Alternative 1, however, would conflict with the formalized
conservation strategy for Tahoe yellow cress, and the memorandum of understanding/conservation
agreement for the species. This cumulative impact would be significant. Implementing the No-Project/NoAction Alternative (Alternative 5) would not alter existing land uses in the study area; thus, it would not
physically divide an established community or conflict with plans, policies, or regulations; however,
Alternative 5 would make no contribution to attaining the goals of the Regional Plan. This impact would be
less than significant.

Neither the restoration components nor the public access, recreation, or habitat protection features of any of the
action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would physically divide an established community. The public access
components of the action alternatives would instead increase connectivity between established communities.
No habitat conservation plan or natural community conservation plan is applicable to the study area, so none of
the action alternatives would conflict with any applicable habitat conservation plan or natural community
conservation plan. However, a formalized conservation strategy exists for Tahoe yellow cress, and a
memorandum of understanding/conservation agreement for the species is in place. Alternatives 2-4 would be
consistent with this memorandum of understanding/conservation agreement. Alternative 1, however, would
conflict with this strategy and memorandum of understanding/conservation agreement because it would
negatively affect Tahoe yellow cress by creating additional recreation features (the bridge and boardwalk) in the
vicinity of occupied habitat creating opportunity for damage by recreationists and removing potential habitat in
the back beach area.
In addition, implementation of any of the action alternatives (Alternative 1-4) would not conflict with applicable
plans, policies, or regulations. Land use under these alternatives would be consistent with the applicable plan area
statements, including special areas, shorezone tolerance districts, and the Tahoe Keys Marina Master Plan. Land
use under these alternatives would also be consistent with the goals and objectives of the city and county general
plans; the Lake Tahoe Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan for the approach/departure zone, which extends into
the southeastern corner of the study area; and the policies and regulations of the California State Lands
Commission, which has jurisdiction over public trust lands, including the beds of Lake Tahoe and the Upper
Truckee River.
Thus, when viewed in connection with other projects, Alternatives 2-4 would not make a considerable
contribution to a cumulative effect on physically dividing an established community or conflicting with land use
plans, policies, and regulations; this cumulative impact would be less than significant. Alternative 1, however,
would conflict with the formalized conservation strategy for Tahoe yellow cress, and the memorandum of
understanding/conservation agreement for the species. This cumulative impact would be significant. Feasible
mitigation is not available to reduce this impact to less than significant, so the residual impact would be
cumulatively significant and unavoidable.

NOISE
IMPACT
3.18-C34
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Noise—Short-Term or Long-Term Increased Noise and Vibration. Noise and vibration
generated by any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would not combine with other noise sources
(existing or related to reasonably foreseeable projects) in the study area or its vicinity to create a
cumulatively significant impact. For that reason, and because construction noise and vibration would be at
less-than-significant levels, short term, and within time periods exempted by applicable ordinances (i.e.,
daytime hours), short-term and long-term noise would be similar to current conditions. Therefore,
implementing any of the action alternatives would not make a considerable contribution to a cumulatively
significant effect on the noise environment; this cumulative impact would be less than significant.
Implementing the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not introduce new sources of
noise or vibration; therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution and would have no impact.

Although implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would generate noise from construction
activity and project-generated construction traffic, and a reasonably foreseeable project in the vicinity of the study
area also could generate construction-related noise (i.e., Al Tahoe Erosion Control project), the action alternatives
would not make a considerable contribution to an overall significant effect on noise in either the short term or
long term. First, construction-related noise generated by any of the action alternatives would not exceed
applicable regulations. Noise from construction activity that occurs between 8:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. (daily) is
exempt from the provisions of the applicable TRPA regulations; noise from construction activity that occurs
between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. (weekdays) and between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. (weekends and federal
holidays) is exempt from the provisions of the applicable El Dorado County regulations because noise sensitivity
is less during these daytime periods than during quieter evening, nighttime, or early morning hours. Because
construction activities and project-generated construction traffic would occur only during these exempt times,
none of the action alternatives would make a considerable contribution to any overall effect on noise that could be
cumulatively significant in the short term. A substantial, ongoing, postconstruction increase in noise would not
occur under any of the action alternatives because the land uses of the study area would be similar to current
conditions following project implementation. In addition, project construction and operation under any of the
action alternatives also would not include major sources of vibration. Finally, reasonably foreseeable projects
would not create a long-term source of noise or vibration in the study area or adjacent neighborhoods. Therefore,
none of the action alternatives would make a considerable contribution to any long-term cumulatively significant
effect on noise or vibration; this impact would be less than significant. Implementing the No-Project/No-Action
Alternative (Alternative 5) would not introduce new sources of noise or vibration; therefore, Alternative 5 would
make no contribution and would have no impact.

PUBLIC SERVICES
IMPACT
3.18-C35
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Public Services—Increased Demand for and Interference with Public Services.
Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would not generate substantial demand for
public services, and this demand would not contribute to an overall cumulatively significant impact in the
study area or its vicinity. Implementing any of the action alternatives could potentially lead to temporary
interference with the ability of animal control, law enforcement, fire protection, and emergency medical
service providers to provide emergency services to the study area and its vicinity, especially if other
reasonably foreseeable projects were to occur at the same time in the area. Environmental Commitment
12 includes commitments to notify public service providers and provide detours where potential access
issues may occur as part of the construction management program and traffic control plan planned as part

of the alternatives. These environmental commitments, along with traffic control measures implemented by
other projects, would reduce the potential for temporary disruption of public services during construction to
a level that would not be cumulatively significant. Therefore, the project would not make a considerable
contribution to a cumulatively significant effect on public services; this impact would be less than
significant. Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5), no additional recreation facilities
would be created, so there would be no additional demand for public services and no roadway
construction that could interfere with emergency response; therefore, Alternative 5 would make no
contribution and would have no impact.
Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) could result in a minor increase in demand for law
enforcement, fire protection, and animal control services, but the increase in demand would be minimal and
would not create the need for additional services or facilities for police, fire, or animal control services. The
combined effects of any alternative with other projects would not result in an overall significant impact on any
public service.
AS described below, implementing any of the action alternatives would not make a considerable contribution to
an overall significant impact on traffic in either the short term or the long term. However, without mitigation,
construction of the action alternatives could lead to temporary interference with the ability of law enforcement,
fire protection, and emergency medical service providers to provide emergency services to the study area or its
vicinity, especially if other reasonably foreseeable projects were being constructed at the same time in the
vicinity. As described in Section 3.12, “Public Services,” implementation of EC 12, “Prepare and Implement
Traffic Control Plans” (Table 2-6), which involves notifying public service providers and providing detours where
potential access issues may occur, would reduce the project’s potential effects on provision of public services
during construction. Along with traffic control measures that would be incorporated into other projects, this
mitigation, planned as part of the alternatives, would prevent the combined effect of this and other projects from
being cumulatively significant. Therefore, the project would not make a considerable contribution to a
cumulatively significant effect on public services; this impact would be less than significant. Under the NoProject/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5), no additional recreation facilities would be created, so there would
be no additional demand for public services and no roadway construction that could interfere with emergency
response; therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution and would have no impact.

RECREATION
IMPACT
3.18-C36
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Recreation—Construction-Related Loss of Recreational Opportunities and Public
Access, Conflicts among Existing and Proposed Recreational Uses, and Increased Use of Existing
Recreational Facilities. Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would involve
construction activities that would reduce access to the Upper Truckee River, Lake Tahoe, and public land
in the study area and thus, for the short term, would displace a small number of recreational users.
Environmental Commitments 13 and 14, planned as part of the action alternatives, would be implemented
to address safety, accessibility, and other recreation opportunities. Other reasonably foreseeable projects
would contemporaneously displace a small number of recreational users and/or limit access to lakes,
public land, or waterways. Nonetheless, the combined effects of any of the action alternatives and other
reasonably foreseeable projects would not cause substantial short-term effects on recreational
opportunities, public access, or existing recreational facilities because of the relatively large number of
similar recreational facilities among which the dislocated users would be dispersed. Therefore, in
connection with other projects, the short-term contribution of any of the action alternatives to effects on
recreational opportunities and public access, conflicts among existing and proposed uses, and existing
recreational facilities would not be cumulatively considerable; this impact would be less than significant.
The No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not involve construction or new recreation
activities that would displace recreational users; therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution and
would have no impact.

lakes in the vicinity. As noted in Section 3.13, “Recreation,” during construction, recreational use of the study
area would be reduced as a small number of recreationists instead used other existing recreational facilities. This
effect would be comparable for all the action alternatives. As described in EC 13, “Prepare and Implement a
Public Outreach Plan,” and EC 14, “Prepare and Implement a Waterway Traffic Control Plan for Alternatives
That Affect the Sailing Lagoon” (Table 2-6), the Conservancy would prepare a Public Outreach Plan and Water
Traffic Control Plan to address safety, accessibility, and other recreation opportunities. Other reasonably
foreseeable projects would also contribute a small number of recreationists to the number of users of existing
recreational facilities during construction. Recreationists displaced by the Upper Truckee River and Marsh
Restoration Project and contemporaneous projects would be distributed around the Tahoe Basin to the numerous
alternative locations for recreation such that there would not be a resulting short-term cumulatively substantial
effect on recreational opportunity; public access to lakes, waterways, or public land; or existing recreational
facilities.
Therefore, in connection with other projects, the construction-related effects of any of the action alternatives
would not make a considerable contribution to cumulative effects on recreational opportunities, conflicts between
existing and proposed recreational uses, public access, or existing recreational facilities; this cumulative impact
would be less than significant. The No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not involve
construction or new recreation activities that would displace recreational users; therefore, Alternative 5 would
make no contribution and would have no impact.
IMPACT
3.18-C37
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Recreation—Operation-Related Loss of Recreational Opportunities and Conflicts
among Surrounding and Proposed Recreational Facilities. Implementing any of the action alternatives
(Alternatives 1–4) would provide additional recreation facilities compared to existing conditions and
therefore have little effect on surrounding recreational facilities with the exception of short-term dispersed
increase in use of nearby facilities during construction. Implementing Alternative 3 would likely change the
timing and location of boat access along the Upper Truckee River, however, these are user-created
facilities and not currently managed for boat access and the study area would remain available to boaters.
Therefore, in connection with the effects of other projects, the effect of operation of Alternatives 1–4 on
recreational facilities would not be cumulatively considerable; this cumulative impact would be less than
significant. The No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not involve changes to access or
facilities or other activities that would displace recreational users; therefore, Alternative 5 would make no
contribution and would have no impact.

In the long term, the cumulative effect of reasonably foreseeable projects (listed in Table 3.18-2) would not create
conflicts between existing and proposed uses, or increase the use of surrounding parks and recreational facilities.
The river and stream restoration and the water quality and erosion control projects would have no impact or
limited adverse or beneficial effects on existing recreational facilities. Only the ongoing urban development
would have a long-term adverse effect on existing dispersed recreational facilities. The projects involving new
bike paths would likely reduce the number of users of some existing dispersed recreational facilities by providing
an alternative location for recreation. Given the slow rate of urban development in the vicinity of the study area,
the availability and capacity of alternate locations for dispersed recreation activity, and the additional
opportunities for dispersed recreation that would be provided by reasonably foreseeable projects, Alternatives 1-4
would not contribute to a significant cumulative long-term decrease in recreational opportunities, conflicts among
existing or proposed recreational facilities, reduction in public access, or long-term increase in the use of
surrounding recreational facilities.

If Alternative 3 is implemented, the Upper Truckee River might have multiple, smaller channels with flows
dispersed over the study area that would change the timing when nonmotorized watercraft access is possible.
However, access is currently dependent on seasonal flows. Under small to moderate flow years, flows would
likely be too shallow to allow access, but during larger flow years, access would be expanded because flows
would spread across the study area. Because access would continue to be dependent on seasonal flow conditions,
and access would continue to be available throughout the rest of the watershed and around the lake, this impact is
not significant. Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would provide additional recreation
facilities compared to existing conditions and therefore have little effect on surrounding recreational facilities with
the exception of short-term dispersed increase in use of nearby facilities during construction.
Therefore, implementing Alternatives 1-4 would not make a considerable contribution to cumulative effects on
recreational opportunities, conflicts between surrounding and proposed recreational facilities and public access;
this cumulative impact would be less than significant. The No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5)
would not involve changes to access or facilities or other activities that would displace recreational users;
therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution and would have no impact.
IMPACT
3.18-C38
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Recreation—Construction or Expansion of Recreational Facilities That May Have an
Adverse Physical Effect on the Environment. The action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would have
short-term significant unavoidable construction impacts but long-term benefits on wildlife, water quality and
fisheries, as discussed in Section 3.4, “Vegetation and Wildlife Resources,” Section 3.5, “Fisheries,” and
Section 3.9, “Geomorphology and Water Quality.” Both the short-term impacts and long-term benefits to
these resources are primarily consequences of the construction of the restoration features of these
alternatives. Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would also involve construction
of public access features that would be used for recreation. With the exception of Alternative 1,
environmental commitments and mitigation measures planned as part of the alternatives as described in
Table 2-6 and Table S-1, respectively, would reduce the long-term adverse effects to the physical
environment from constructing these features and the residual contributions to cumulative effects would
not be considerable (as discussed for each resource area in this section). The recreation facilities
associated with Alternative 1 are designed to preserve the natural resources in the study area while
providing compatible recreational opportunities, public access, and recreational infrastructure. However,
the boardwalk and bridge would likely attract more visitors than the other alternatives. Furthermore, the
bridge and boardwalk would be located within Tahoe yellow cress habitat in the back beach area and may
lead to negative impacts on the Tahoe yellow cress population. Consequently, implementing any of the
action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) in combination with projects related to construction or expansion of
recreational facilities would contribute to a short-term significant impact; however, Alternatives 2–4 would
not cause an adverse long-term effect and this cumulative impact would be less than significant.
Implementing Alternative 1, however, would result in a contribution to a cumulative long-term impact that
would be significant. The No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not involve projectrelated construction or expansion of recreational facilities in the study area; therefore, Alternative 5 would
make no contribution and would have no impact.

The action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would have short-term construction impacts on wildlife, water quality
and fisheries, as discussed in Section 3.4, “Vegetation and Wildlife Resources,” Section 3.5, “Fisheries,” and
Section 3.9, “Geomorphology and Water Quality,” but long-term benefits to these resources. Both the short-term
impacts and long-term benefits to these resources are primarily consequences of the construction of the restoration
features of these alternatives. The cumulative effects of project construction are discussed in each resource section
of this cumulative impact analysis.
The Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project would also include public access features; some of these
features and related construction activities have the potential to adversely affect the environment. Among the
action alternatives, Alternative 1 would have the most new public access features and the greatest potential
impacts, and Alternative 2 would have the fewest new public access features and the least potential impacts;

Alternatives 3 and 4 would have intermediate amounts of new public access features. With the exception of
Alternative 1, environmental commitments (Table 2-6) and mitigation measures (Table ES-1) planned as part of
the action alternatives would reduce the adverse effects to the physical environment from recreation features and
the residual contributions to cumulative effects would not be considerable (as discussed for each resource area in
this section). The recreation facilities associated with Alternative 1 are designed to preserve the natural resources
in the study area while providing compatible recreational opportunities, public access, and recreational
infrastructure. However, the boardwalk and bridge would likely attract more visitors than the other alternatives.
Furthermore, the bridge and boardwalk would be located within Tahoe yellow cress habitat in the back beach area
and may lead to negative impacts on the Tahoe yellow cress population.
Other reasonably foreseeable projects related to the construction or expansion of recreational facilities would
incorporate mitigation measures to reduce their project-specific and cumulative effects on the environment. Some
of the reasonably foreseeable projects involving the construction or expansion of recreational facilities have also
been designed to protect, enhance, or restore sensitive resources. Consequently, implementing any of the action
alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) in combination with projects related to construction or expansion of recreational
facilities would contribute to a short-term significant impact. Alternatives 2-4 would not cause an adverse longterm effect, however, and this cumulative impact would be less than significant.
Implementing Alternative 1, however, would result in a contribution to a cumulative long-term impact that would
be significant. Feasible mitigation is not available to reduce this impact to less than significant, so the residual
impact would be cumulatively significant and unavoidable.
The No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not involve project-related construction or
expansion of recreational facilities in the study area; therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution and
would have no impact.

SCENIC RESOURCES
IMPACT
3.18-C39
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Scenic Resources—Short-Term Glare from Construction Activities. Implementing
foreseeable projects in the vicinity of the study area would involve construction activities that may
temporarily create glare, but construction would not require construction lighting because construction
would not occur at night. Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would also involve
construction activities that may temporarily create glare but that would not require construction lighting
because construction would not occur at night. Potential glare effects would be intermittent, confined to the
short term, and unlikely to combine with the effects of other projects. Therefore, these effects would not be
a considerable contribution to cumulative effects on glare on their own, or in combination; this cumulative
impact would be less than significant. The No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not
involve construction or changes to existing land uses, and thus would not alter light and glare in the study
area; therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution and would have no impact.

Glare can be an annoyance to nearby residences, and lighting can reduce the quality of nighttime views.
Nighttime lighting can also cause skyglow, a glow that extends beyond the light source and reduces views of the
nighttime sky, which are a scenic resource.
The project could introduce heavy construction vehicles and equipment that may create some glare. However,
construction would not take place at night and would not require construction lighting. In addition, potential glare
effects related to construction would be intermittent and short term.
Under any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4), no new lighting or facilities constructed of materials that
would create new sources of light, glare, or skyglow would be constructed. Other projects either would not create
new sources of light, glare, or skyglow (e.g., most restoration and erosion control projects listed in Table 3.18-2)
or would be required to conform to all applicable design standards in the TRPA Code of Ordinances (e.g., the

small residential, commercial, industrial, and infrastructure projects included in Table 3.18-2 as “Additional
Urban Development”). It is unlikely that the short-term, intermittent glare resulting from implementing any of the
action alternatives would be combined with glare from other projects.
In summary, the action alternatives would have only short-term, intermittent effects on glare, and in combination
with other projects, these effects would not be a considerable contribution to the cumulative effect on glare; this
impact would be less than significant. The No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not involve
construction or changes to existing land uses and thus would not alter light and glare in the study area; therefore,
Alternative 5 would make no contribution and would have no impact.
IMPACT
3.18-C40
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Scenic Resources—Short-Term and Long-Term Effects of Construction Activities and
Additional Facilities on Existing Visual Character and Quality. Implementing foreseeable projects
would affect visual character and quality in the vicinity of the study area, including the scenic quality of
Roadway Travel Unit 35 and potentially including the scenic quality of Shoreline Travel Unit 33. These
projects would intermittently alter views during construction but would not substantially alter visual
character or quality in the long term. During the short term, implementing any of the action alternatives
(Alternatives 1–4) would entail construction activities that would intermittently alter visual character and
quality. However, all such construction-related impacts would be intermittent and short term. For all action
alternatives this short-term impact would be less than significant. Constructed project elements under
Alternatives 2–4 would be consistent with existing views, the low-lying boardwalk and observation
platforms would be relatively well screened by existing vegetation, and the study area would remain
largely undeveloped and unchanged in the long term. Under Alternative 1, however, the bridge across the
Upper Truckee River would result in a substantial change in views from Shoreline Travel Unit 33.
Alternative 1 would contribute to cumulative long-term impact. This impact would be significant. The longterm contribution to a cumulative impact on scenic resources under Alternatives 2–4 would be less than
significant. The No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not alter visual character or quality
of the study area; therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution and would have no impact.

Implementing foreseeable projects would result in changes to the visual character and quality of the study area or
its vicinity, but these changes would not make a considerable contribution to cumulative effects on visual
character and quality, for the reasons described below.
Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would alter the visual character and quality of the
study area and its vicinity. In the short term, implementing any of these alternatives would involve construction
activities and staging areas in the study area that would change views during a period of approximately 3–5 years.
However, all such construction-related impacts would be intermittent and short term. As described in Section
3.14, “Scenic Resources,” implementing Alternative 2, 3, or 4 would not result in long-term changes in views
from Roadway Travel Unit 35, Shoreline Travel Unit 33, or the surrounding area. Implementing Alternative 1,
however, would result in a long-term change in views from Shoreline Travel Unit 33. Although screening and
optimal colors would be used, long-term changes in views would occur with implementation of Alternative 1.
Other projects could also affect scenic resources in the study area, its vicinity, or both, including views from
Roadway Travel Unit 35 and potentially views from Shoreline Travel Unit 33. Reasonably foreseeable projects in
the vicinity of the study area include the Upper Truckee River Middle Reaches 1 and 2 SEZ and Habitat
Enhancement project and the Al Tahoe Erosion Control project and may include small residential, commercial,
and/or infrastructure development projects in the vicinity of the study area. The Upper Truckee River Middle
Reaches 1 and 2 SEZ and Habitat Enhancement project would be visible from Roadway Travel Unit 35, but the
temporary effects related to its construction would occur before implementation of the Upper Truckee River and
Marsh Restoration Project, and its short-term and long-term effects on visual character and quality would be
minor and may not be adverse. The Al Tahoe Erosion Control project would not be visible from Roadway Travel
Unit 35 or Shoreline Travel Unit 33 and implementing the project would not result in substantial short-term or
long-term effects on visual character or quality. Any other small development projects that may occur in the

vicinity of the study area would be required to conform to standards in the TRPA Code of Ordinances designed to
maintain scenic resources (i.e., Section 30.12, “Scenic Quality Standards”). These standards have been designed
to ensure that cumulatively significant impacts on scenic resources would not result if applicable standards were
conformed to by future projects. Also, small development projects that may occur in the vicinity of the study area
may not be visible from Roadway Travel Unit 35 or Shoreline Travel Unit 33 and therefore may not affect the
same scenic resources as other projects.
During the short term, implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would entail construction
activities that would intermittently alter visual character and quality. Constructed project elements under
Alternatives 2-4 would be consistent with existing views, the low-lying boardwalk and observation platforms
would be relatively well screened by existing vegetation, and the study area would remain largely undeveloped
and unchanged in the long term. Under Alternative 1, however, the bridge across the Upper Truckee River would
result in a substantial change in views from Shoreline Travel Unit 33. Alternative 1 would contribute to a
cumulative long-term impact. This impact would be significant. Additional feasible mitigation is not available to
reduce this impact to less than significant, so the residual impact would be significant and unavoidable. The
long-term contribution to a cumulative impact on scenic resources under Alternatives 2-4 would be less than
significant. The No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not alter visual character or quality of
the study area; therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution and would have no impact.

SOCIOECONOMICS, POPULATION AND HOUSING, AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
IMPACT
3.18-C41
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Socioeconomics, Population and Housing, and Environmental Justice—Increase in
Population and Housing Demand Resulting from Construction-Related Activities. Implementing any
of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would not directly induce any long-term population growth,
displace substantial numbers of people or existing housing, or require replacement housing to be
constructed elsewhere. It would, however, involve construction activities. Any of these alternatives,
together with other construction projects, would generate a short-term increase in employment in South
Lake Tahoe from construction-related activities. However, this increase would be small relative to the
existing labor pool in the City of South Lake Tahoe and nearby communities and thus would not be a
considerable contribution to cumulative effects on population growth or on demand for housing; this
cumulative impact would be less than significant. The No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5)
would not include any construction or other new short-term activities; therefore, Alternative 5 would make
no contribution and would have no impact.

Because implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would not involve new housing or new
employment opportunities, it would not directly induce long-term population growth, displace substantial
numbers of people or existing housing, or require replacement housing to be constructed elsewhere. Thus, no
long-term impact on population and housing would occur as a result of implementing any of these alternatives.
Implementing any of the action alternatives could, however, potentially contribute to a short-term increase in
population and housing demand from construction-related activities. For any of these alternatives, the demand for
construction workers would be small relative to the existing labor pool of at least several hundred construction
workers in the City of South Lake Tahoe and nearby communities. Therefore, the number of existing construction
workers in the region is anticipated to be sufficient to meet the demands associated with implementing these
alternatives, making the impact of this short-term increase in employment less than significant. Cumulatively,
demand for construction workers from the project combined with other projects anticipated during the same
construction seasons also would be less than the existing labor pool. (Although based on demographic data and
estimates of required construction workers, this interpretation is consistent with the outcome of recent
construction seasons with comparable amounts of construction. No evidence of a labor shortage has been
demonstrated, planned construction was able to be accomplished with the existing labor pool, and projects were
not delayed to future seasons because of labor shortages.) Because the existing labor pool is sufficient to construct
the proposed and concurrent projects, implementing the project would not make a considerable contribution to a

IMPACT
3.18-C42
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Socioeconomics, Population and Housing, and Environmental Justice—Potential
Long-Term Increases in Sales or Incomes of Local Businesses Resulting from Additional Visitors
to the Study Area. Each of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) includes public access facilities that
could attract visitors to the study area and thus potentially increase commercial activity at local businesses
in South Lake Tahoe. Public access or recreation facilities are also planned for other reasonably
foreseeable projects in the area. Nonetheless, the overall number of additional visitors would not be
substantial because there are already many similar facilities in the Tahoe Basin to attract visitors looking
for similar recreational experiences. Therefore, implementing any of the action alternatives together with
other reasonably foreseeable projects would not result in a substantial increase in sales or incomes of
local businesses in South Lake Tahoe; this cumulative impact would be less than significant. Under the
No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5), no additional recreation facilities would be constructed,
and existing facilities would not be expanded; therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution and
would have no impact.

Each of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) includes public access facilities that could attract visitors to the
study area and thus potentially increase commercial activity at local businesses in South Lake Tahoe. The overall
number of additional visitors would not be substantial; therefore, only a minimal increase in commercial activity
would be associated with any of these alternatives. The recreation facilities planned for other restoration projects
in the Upper Truckee River watershed and other reasonably foreseeable projects are similar to the Upper Truckee
River and Marsh Restoration Project in that they consist of trails and other dispersed recreation facilities or
reconfiguration of existing public access or recreation facilities (such as the Lake Tahoe Golf Course). Although
additional public access and dispersed recreation facilities in existing public lands improve the visitor experience,
there are already many similar facilities in the Tahoe Basin to attract visitors looking for that experience.
Consequently, the change in recreation opportunities resulting from implementing the project in conjunction with
other reasonably foreseeable projects would not be sufficient to increase the number of recreation visitors
substantially; this cumulative impact would be less than significant.
Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5), no restoration activities, construction of public
access facilities, or habitat restoration and enhancement would occur in the study area; therefore, Alternative 5
would make no contribution and would have no impact.

TRANSPORTATION, PARKING, AND CIRCULATION
IMPACT
3.18-C43
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Transportation, Parking, and Circulation—Construction and Operation Impacts on the
Local and Regional Circulation System. Under existing conditions, roadways in neighborhoods adjacent
to the study area operate at levels above the minimum acceptable LOS. Implementing reasonably
foreseeable projects would not result in substantial construction-related traffic in the study area or adjacent
neighborhoods. Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would generate construction
traffic but would not reduce operation below the minimum LOS. In addition, the effects of implementing the
Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project would be reduced by implementing Environmental
Commitment 12, which involves developing traffic control plans as part of the action alternatives.
Implementing reasonably foreseeable projects also would not cause a long-term increase in traffic in the
study area or adjacent neighborhoods, and the increase resulting from any of the action alternatives would
be small relative to overall traffic and insufficient to alter levels of service. Therefore, the combined effect
of implementing reasonably foreseeable projects and any of the action alternatives would not be sufficient
to cause a cumulatively significant impact on traffic. Under existing conditions, the supply of parking is
sufficient to satisfy demand for parking, and implementing reasonably foreseeable projects would not

Cumulative Impacts

3.18-58

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

increase demand for parking in the study area or adjacent neighborhoods. Implementing any of the action
alternatives would result in an increase in demand for parking, but as described in Section 3.16,
“Transportation, Parking, and Circulation,” the increased demand for parking would be satisfied by
available supply. Therefore, in connection with other projects, none of the action alternatives would make
a considerable contribution to cumulative effects on traffic or parking in either the short term or the long
term; this cumulative impact would be less than significant. No construction or changes to the study area
would occur under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5); therefore, Alternative 5 would
make no contribution and would have no impact.
Under existing conditions, potentially affected roadways in adjacent neighborhoods and the intersections of these
roads with U.S. 50 operate at LOS A–C, which are above the minimum acceptable level of service (LOS D). The
existing demand for parking by visitors to the study area is accommodated by available parking.
Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would generate construction-related traffic.
Construction-related traffic would be greater under Alternative 4 than under Alternative 1, 2, or 3. However,
under any of the action alternatives, the addition of this automobile and truck traffic would not cause any
intersections currently operating at an overall level of service within the range of LOS A–C to operate at an
overall level of service within the range of LOS D–F. In addition, the effects of construction-related traffic would
be reduced by implementing EC 12, “Prepare and Implement Traffic Control Plans,” described in Table 2-6. The
traffic control plans would follow the standards of the agency responsible for the affected roadway. Measures
typically identified in traffic control plans include advertising planned lane closures, posting warning signage,
using a flag person to direct traffic flows when needed, and adopting methods to ensure continued access by
emergency vehicles. During project construction, access to existing land uses would be maintained at all times,
with detours used as necessary during road closures. The plans would reduce effects on transportation and
circulation.
Construction-related traffic also would be generated by reasonably foreseeable projects in South Lake Tahoe, but
outside of the neighborhoods adjacent to the study area, such as the Sunset Stables Restoration and Resource
Management Plan Project, and the El Dorado U.S. 50, Segment 2—Lake Tahoe Airport to U.S. 50/SR 89 Junction
Water Quality Improvement Project. However, construction traffic from these projects would generate only a
small fraction of the overall traffic on local and regional roadways, and it would not enter and exit U.S. 50 at the
same intersections as construction traffic associated with any of the action alternatives. Furthermore, reasonably
foreseeable projects would be constructed at various times and locations in South Lake Tahoe during the summer
construction period over the life of the project, which would further reduce their potential to affect intersections
that would be measurably affected by implementing any of the action alternatives. Therefore, implementing these
other projects and the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project would not result in a substantial
combined peak traffic congestion impact in the vicinity of the study area, which under existing conditions
operates above minimum standards. Thus, the construction-related effects of any of the action alternatives in
connection with other projects would not result in a considerable contribution to cumulative effects on traffic or
circulation.
Reasonably foreseeable projects would not generate a long-term increase in traffic in the study area or adjacent
neighborhoods. Although implementing any of the action alternatives could result in a long-term increase in
recreational use of the study area, it also would not increase traffic substantially. Alternative 1 would have the
greatest effect on recreational use because it includes the most public access features (however, it also includes
parking facilities), Alternative 2 would have the least effect because it includes the fewest public access features,
and Alternatives 3 and 4 would have intermediate effects. While an increase in use would occur for any of the
action alternatives, this increase would not significantly increase traffic loads (as described in Section 3.16,
“Transportation, Parking, and Circulation”). Therefore, in combination with the effects of other projects, the
effects of any of the action alternatives would not create an unacceptable level of service or otherwise cause a
cumulatively significant effect on transportation or circulation.

Similarly, implementing reasonably foreseeable projects would not increase demand for parking in the study area
or in adjacent neighborhoods. Implementing any of the action alternatives would result in a small increase in
public use of the study area, and the increased demand for parking would be small relative to available parking
capacity in the vicinity of the study area. Also, near the western boundary of the study area, the supply of parking
may be increased under Alternative 1 through a joint-use agreement between the Conservancy and the Tahoe
Keys Marina. Thus, implementing any of the action alternatives would not result in a considerable contribution to
the cumulative effect on parking.
In summary, implementing any of the action alternatives in connection with other projects would not cause a
considerable contribution to cumulative effects on transportation, parking, or circulation; this cumulative impact
would be less than significant.
Under the No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5), no construction activities or other changes would
occur; therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution and would have no impact.

UTILITIES
IMPACT
3.18-C44
(Alts. 1–5)

Cumulative Utilities—Short-Term and Long-Term Impacts on Sanitary Sewer, Potable Water,
Natural Gas, Electrical, Storm Drain, and Solid Waste Utilities. The action alternatives (Alternatives 1–
4) entail construction activities and long-term changes in use of the study area that would cause a variety
of effects on utilities. However, even in combination with the impacts of other reasonably foreseeable
projects, the impacts of any of the action alternatives would not make a considerable contribution to a
cumulative effect on utilities because all reasonably foreseeable projects would not appreciably increase
long-term utility demand and would be required to comply with local waste diversion and recycling
requirements, and because area landfills have enough remaining capacity to accommodate potential
increase in solid waste generated from all projects; this cumulative impact would be less than significant.
The No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not entail construction activities or any longterm changes in use of the study area; therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution and would
have no impact.

Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1-4) would involve constructing public access facilities,
some of which have the potential to increase recreational use of the study area. Both construction activities and
increased recreational use of the study area would affect utilities.
Construction activities could potentially contribute to a short-term increase in utility demand and solid waste
generation. For any of these alternatives, the increased demand on utilities and solid waste generation resulting
from construction would be small relative to the existing demand and waste generation from the population in the
City of South Lake Tahoe and nearby communities. Liberty Energy is expected to have adequate energy
resources, and the Lockwood Landfill has adequate capacity, making this impact less than significant. Increased
utility demand and solid waste generation resulting from construction activities associated with the project
combined with those of other projects anticipated during the same construction seasons also would be small
relative to the existing demand. Thus, the project’s construction-related effects would not make a considerable
contribution to cumulative effects on utilities.
Although none of the action alternatives include sanitary sewer, potable water, or other utility connections, a very
small increase in solid waste generation resulting from a small increase in recreational use could have a long-term
impact. Currently, South Tahoe Refuse collects solid waste from the area. To comply with state law, all recyclable
waste is recycled, and only nonrecyclable waste is taken to the Lockwood Landfill, which has adequate capacity.
Increased solid waste generation resulting from implementing the project combined with that from implementing
other reasonably foreseeable projects would be small relative to the existing waste generation from the population
in the City of South Lake Tahoe and nearby communities, and these projects also would need to meet the state’s
recycling and waste diversion requirements. Because this increase is very small relative to existing waste

generation from the population in the CSLT and nearby communities and because Lockwood Landfill has
adequate capacity, the project’s long-term contribution to cumulative effects on utilities would not be
considerable. In summary, the project’s short-term and long-term contribution to cumulative effects on sanitary
sewer, potable water, natural gas, electrical, storm drain, and solid waste utilities would be less than significant.
The No-Project/No-Action Alternative (Alternative 5) would not result in project-related short-term or long-term
impacts on utilities. Under this alternative, no additional waste or utility demand would be generated, and no
increase is stormwater is expected; therefore, Alternative 5 would make no contribution and would have no
impact.

SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS THAT CANNOT BE
AVOIDED

CEQA Section 21100(b)(2)(A) states that an EIR shall include a detailed statement setting forth “[i]n a separate
section…[a]ny significant effect on the environment that cannot be avoided if the project is implemented.” State
CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.2(b) requires that an EIR describe any significant impacts, including those that
can be mitigated but not reduced to a less-than-significant level. In addition, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
Title 40, Section 1502.16 (40 CFR 1502.16) and Section 3.7.2 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances require an EIS to
identify any significant adverse environmental effects that cannot be avoided if any of the alternatives are
implemented. Chapter 3 of this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS addresses the potential environmental effects of the project
alternatives for all applicable environmental topic areas and recommends mitigation measures, as necessary, to
mitigate project effects to the extent feasible. The contributions of project alternatives to cumulative impacts are
discussed in Section 3.18, “Cumulative Impacts,” of this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS.
If a specific impact cannot be reduced to a less-than-significant level, it is considered a significant and
unavoidable impact. The action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would have the following significant and
unavoidable environmental impacts (direct, indirect, and cumulative):

As discussed in Table 2-6, the Conservancy will implement several environmental commitments to reduce
potential environmental impacts. Where feasible mitigation exists, it also has been included to reduce these
impacts; however, the mitigation and/or environmental commitments would not be sufficient to reduce these
impacts to a less-than-significant level.

4.2

SIGNIFICANT AND IRREVERSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES

CEQA Section 21100(b)(2)(B) states that an EIR shall analyze in a separate section significant and irreversible
environmental changes. State CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.2(c) provides the following guidance for an
analysis of the significant and irreversible changes of a project:
Uses of nonrenewable resources during the initial and continued phases of the project may be
irreversible since a large commitment of such resources makes removal or nonuse thereafter
unlikely. Primary impacts and, particularly, secondary impacts (such as highway improvement
which provides access to a previously inaccessible area) generally commit future generations to
similar uses. Also irreversible damage can result from environmental accidents associated with
the project. Irretrievable commitments of resources should be evaluated to assure that such
current consumption is justified.
40 CFR 1502.16 also states that an EIS shall analyze irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources such
as soils, wetlands, and waterfowl habitat. The irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources is the
permanent loss of resources for future or alternative purposes. These resources cannot be recovered or recycled or
are consumed or reduced to unrecoverable forms. As discussed in Chapter 2, “Project Alternatives,” of this
DEIR/DEIS/DEIS, implementing Alternative 1 would involve constructing recreation and public access facilities
(e.g., kiosks, bridge, boardwalk, bicycle paths, and pedestrian trails), reestablishing and improving floodplain
processes through a combination of approaches, and restoring various habitats. A potential “maximum” level of
recreation and public access infrastructure would be constructed under Alternative 1. Constructing recreational
facilities under Alternative 1 would commit future generations to the use of those facilities in the study area
because some of the facilities (e.g., kiosks, bridge) are relatively permanent structures.

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX

4-2

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

Implementing Alternative 2 also would involve constructing recreation and public access facilities, reestablishing
and improving floodplain processes, and restoring various habitats; however, a relatively minimal level of public
access and recreation infrastructure would be constructed under Alternative 2. Therefore, although some
components of Alternative 2 would commit future generations to the proposed uses to some extent, the
commitment would be less than under Alternative 1.
Both Alternatives 3 and 4 would involve a moderate amount of recreational development, habitat restoration, and
restoration of the Upper Truckee River and its floodplain. Implementing either Alternative 3 or 4 would involve
constructing a kiosk, bicycle paths, and pedestrian trails; however, neither alternative would include the bridge
and connected boardwalk that would be constructed under Alternative 1. Implementing Alternative 3 or 4 would
commit future generations to the proposed uses under those alternatives; however, the commitment would be less
than under Alternative 1.
Implementing Alternative 5 (the No-Project/No-Action Alternative) would involve no significant irreversible or
irretrievable commitments of resources.
Although the selection of one of the action alternatives would commit future generations to the approved uses,
the commitment could for the most part be reversed. Changes in the use or restoration of natural resources in the
study area under Alternative 2, 3, or 4 would be feasible if future decisions by the Conservancy directed such
changes. Therefore, the impacts on land use related to Alternative 2, 3, or 4 would not be irreversible.
Construction of some of the recreational facilities under Alternative 1 (e.g., kiosks, bridge) would be more
difficult to remove and would largely commit future generations to those uses.
Implementing Alternative 1, 2, 3, or 4 would result in the irreversible and irretrievable commitment of energy and
material resources during construction and operations. Energy would be expended in the form of gasoline, diesel
fuel, and oil for equipment and transportation vehicles. Building materials for the project would include rocks,
sand, asphalt, concrete, steel, and other materials. Construction activities would generate nonrecyclable materials,
such as solid waste and construction debris. The use of these nonrenewable resources is expected to account for a
very small portion of the resources in the Tahoe Basin and their area of origin (generally, northern California and
Nevada) and would not affect the availability of these resources for other needs in the basin.

4.3

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SHORT-TERM USES OF THE
ENVIRONMENT AND THE MAINTENANCE AND ENHANCEMENT OF
LONG-TERM PRODUCTIVITY

Section 3.7.2 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances and 40 CFR 1502.16 require a discussion of the relationship
between a project’s local short-term uses of the environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term
productivity. The following discussion addresses how implementing the project would affect the short-term use
and the long-term productivity of the environment.
The study area is composed of land that may be needed for project implementation or may be required for access
during construction. It includes the downstream reaches of Trout Creek and the Upper Truckee River, adjacent
wetland and uplands habitats, more than three-fourths of a mile of Lake Tahoe shoreline, and the Lower West
Side Wetland Restoration Area. The study area is easily accessible and is used extensively by the public.
Implementation of any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would result in short-term impacts in the study
area. These impacts would include reduced recreational access to the study area, local traffic and circulation
interference, increased ambient noise levels, exceedance of the turbidity standards, and disruption of wildlife use
of some habitats. Because these impacts would occur only during construction and for a short period after, they
are not expected to adversely affect the long-term productivity of the natural environment.

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

4-3

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Other Required Sections

The project’s short-term effects would be related to the project’s long-term beneficial effects on socioeconomic
productivity. Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) would improve public access and
recreational opportunities and experiences in the study area, which could attract additional visitors, potentially
increasing commercial activity at local businesses. Therefore, implementing any of the action alternatives could
result in a slight increase in long-term socioeconomic productivity. A substantial increase in revenues or longterm productivity in the study area or South Lake Tahoe area would not result under any of the action alternatives.
Implementing Alternative 5 (the No-Project/No-Action Alternative) would result in long-term socioeconomic
productivity similar to existing conditions.
The project’s short-term effects also would be related to the project’s long-term beneficial effects on river and
floodplain ecosystem productivity (e.g., on the services produced by ecosystems, including sediment and nutrient
retention and decreased erosion rates, and provision of fish, wildlife, and plant habitats). Increased sediment and
nutrient retention would also have beneficial effects on conditions in Lake Tahoe. Most of these beneficial effects
would be similar among the action alternatives, but some substantial differences would exist among these
alternatives. The floodplain area inundated by a two-year recurrence flow (at median lake levels) would be much
greater under Alternative 2 or 3 than under Alternative 1 or 4, and enhanced core habitat area would be greater
under Alternative 2 or 4 than under Alternative 1, and it would be smallest under Alternative 3. While Alternative
1 does enhance the core habitat area it also includes a bridge that increases access to sensitive Tahoe yellow cress
habitat and therefore has a long term significant and unavoidable impact to Tahoe yellow cress. Implementing
Alternative 5 (the No-Project/No-Action Alternative) would result in the continuation of existing adverse
conditions and trends in the productivity of river and floodplain ecosystems.

4.4

GROWTH-INDUCING IMPACTS

CEQA Section 21100(b)(5) specifies that the growth-inducing impacts of a project must be addressed in an EIR.
Section 15126.2(d) of the State CEQA Guidelines provides that a project alternative would be growth inducing if
it could “foster economic or population growth, or the construction of additional housing, either directly or
indirectly, in the surrounding environment.” Direct growth inducement would result if a project involved, for
example, the construction of new housing. Indirect growth inducement would result if a project established
substantial new permanent employment opportunities (e.g., new commercial, industrial, or governmental
enterprises), involved a construction effort with substantial short-term employment opportunities that would
indirectly stimulate the need for additional housing and services, or removed an obstacle to housing development.
Examples of growth-inducing actions include developing water, wastewater, fire, or other types of service areas in
areas not previously served; extending transportation routes into previously undeveloped areas; and establishing
major new employment opportunities.
Direct growth would not be induced under any of the project alternatives because none of the project alternatives
propose additional housing. In addition, implementing the project would not indirectly induce growth because
substantial new permanent employment opportunities would not result under any of the action alternatives.
Construction of Alternative 1, 2, 3, or 4 would generate short-term employment opportunities; the work would be
temporary and would occur over several years, with certain activities starting and stopping for shorter durations
within that period. Alternative 5 (the No-Project/No-Action Alternative) would not involve any work. Because of
the limited number and type of jobs that would be generated and the temporary nature of those jobs, it is
anticipated that the jobs would be filled using the existing local employment pool. Existing available housing in
the region would easily accommodate any workers who relocate from outside the area, if needed. The number of
permanent employees would not increase under any of the alternatives. Therefore, none of the alternatives would
have an effect on the local workforce or would significantly affect employment.
In addition, the project would not involve the provision of any new services or construction of new utilities to the
study area that would have more capacity than needed for uses currently being proposed, and no road
improvements are proposed as part of the project. For these reasons, indirect growth-inducing impacts resulting
from implementing the project would be less than significant.

As discussed in Section 3.15, “Socioeconomics, Population and Housing, and Environmental Justice,” a slight
increase in economic growth may be realized under Alternative 1, 2, 3, or 4 because each would improve public
access and recreational opportunities and experiences in the study area, which could attract additional visitors.
However, this increase would be expected to be minimal, resulting in no significant indirect growth-inducing
effects. Implementing Alternative 5 (the No-Project/No-Action Alternative) would result in no change in
economic growth because no changes to public access or recreational opportunities or experiences would occur.

4.5

ENVIRONMENTALLY SUPERIOR ALTERNATIVE/ENVIRONMENTALLY
PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE

NEPA requires that the alternative considered to be environmentally preferable be identified. “Environmentally
preferable” is used to describe the alternative that would best promote the national environmental policy as
expressed in Section 101 of the National Environmental Policy Act—that is, it would cause the least damage to
the biological and physical environment. In addition, the “environmentally preferable” alternative best protects,
preserves, and enhances historic, cultural, and natural resources. Although U.S. Council on Environmental
Quality regulations require that the environmentally preferred alternative be identified, they do not require that
this alternative be adopted.
Section 101(b) of NEPA states:
In order to carry out the policy set forth in this Act, it is the continuing responsibility of the Federal
Government to use all practicable means, consistent with other essential considerations of national policy, to
improve and coordinate federal plans, functions, programs and resources to the end that the Nation may—
(1) fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the environment for succeeding generations;
(2) assure for all Americans safe, healthful, productive, and aesthetically and culturally pleasing
surroundings;
(3) attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation, risk to health or safety,
or other undesirable and unintended consequences;
(4) preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage, and maintain,
wherever possible, an environment which supports diversity, and variety of individual choice;
(5) achieve a balance between population and resource use which will permit high standards of living and a
wide sharing of life’s amenities; and
(6) enhance the quality of renewable resources and approach the maximum attainable recycling of
dependable resources.
The State CEQA Guidelines (Section 15126.6(a) and e(2)) require that an EIR’s analysis of alternatives identify
the “environmentally superior” alternative among all of those considered. In addition, if the No-Project
Alternative is identified as the environmentally superior alternative, then the EIR must also identify the
environmentally superior alternative among the other alternatives. Under CEQA, the goal of identifying the
environmentally superior alternative is to assist decision makers in considering project approval. CEQA does not
require an agency to select the environmentally superior alternative (State CEQA Guidelines Section 15042–
15043).
The TRPA Compact and Code of Ordinances do not specifically call for identifying an environmentally superior
or preferred alternative; however, they rely on other state and federal regulations and when evaluating
alternatives, TRPA identifies the alternative that would best maintain and/or achieve environmental thresholds
(discussed in Section 4.5, “Consequences for Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities,” below). The

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Other Required Sections

Compact and the Code of Ordinances allow for the consideration of social, technical, or economic impacts when
an alternative is selected.
Based on the analysis of impacts on resources in Chapter 3, the action alternatives present trade-offs related to
overall environmental advantages. Implementing Alternative 1, 2, 3, or 4 would involve restoring the river and its
floodplain, which would improve long-term water quality, increase the amount and improve the quality of aquatic
and floodplain habitats, and restore the stream environment zone. These alternatives would have short-term and
interim impacts on water quality that could not be avoided because of the strict turbidity criteria used to determine
a significant and unavoidable impact (Section 3.8) and to sensitive habitats and wildlife (Section 3.4).
Implementing Alternative 1 would also create long-term significant and unavoidable scenic impacts and Tahoe
yellow cress impacts related to bridge construction (Sections 3.4 and 3.14). Implementing Alternative 3 could
have a long-term significant unavoidable impact to fish passage through the study area during low flow periods if
channel disconnectivity occurs (Section 3.5). Implementing Alternative 5 (the No-Project/No-Action Alternative)
would avoid the adverse impacts generated by construction of additional recreational facilities; however, the longterm water quality and habitat benefits would not occur. Consequently, Alternative 5 (the No-Project/No-Action
Alternative) is not the environmentally superior or environmentally preferred alternative.
Of the action alternatives, Alternative 2, New Channel—West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure), is
the environmentally superior alternative because it involves a relatively minimal level of impacts associated with
public access and recreational infrastructure while including river, lagoon, floodplain, and beach and dune
restoration benefits comparable to or greater than those under Alternative 1, 3, or 4. However, unlike under the
other action alternatives, implementing Alternative 2 would not provide recreation infrastructure to redirect public
access from sensitive areas. Compared with the other action alternatives, this alternative minimizes construction
activities and costs, maintenance and staffing responsibilities and costs, disturbances associated with
infrastructure construction, and formal public access to locations throughout the study area.
Although Alternative 2 would be environmentally superior, it includes non-environmental trade-offs.
Implementing Alternative 2 would provide the least benefit for public access and recreation opportunities and
experiences.

4.6

CONSEQUENCES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL THRESHOLD CARRYING
CAPACITIES

TRPA Threshold Carrying Capacities (thresholds) are standards of environmental quality to be achieved in the
Tahoe Region. The standards identify the level of human impact the Lake Tahoe environment can withstand
before irreparable damage occurs. Thresholds have been established for nine resource areas:
►
►
►
►
►
►
►
►
►

air quality;
water quality;
soil conservation;
vegetation preservation;
fisheries;
wildlife;
scenic;
noise; and
recreation.

The thresholds and the indicators used to measure how well a project complies with the thresholds were adopted
in 1987 and remain in effect today. The analysis of attainment status (i.e., whether each threshold is being
achieved and/or maintained) is updated approximately every five years and was most recently assessed in the
2011 Threshold Evaluation (TRPA 2012).

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

An evaluation of the effects of each of the project alternatives on the thresholds is provided below for the nine
resource areas. For each threshold, it is stated whether the threshold is applicable to the project and, if so, what the
consequences of implementing each alternative would be on each applicable threshold. The evaluation of the
project alternatives’ effects on the thresholds focuses on long-term changes in attainment. Short-term impacts
associated with construction of each of the alternatives would be temporary and intermittent and would not
change the attainment status of any of the thresholds. Thresholds in “attainment” are those meeting the adopted
TRPA standard, and thresholds in “non-attainment” are not meeting the TRPA standard. Thresholds are
designated as “unknown” when TRPA did not have adequate data to make a determination of attainment.

4.6.1

AIR QUALITY

Eight numerical air quality thresholds have been established by TRPA:
►
►
►
►
►
►
►
►

AQ-1, Carbon Monoxide;
AQ-2, Ozone (ROG [reactive organic gases] and NOX [oxides of nitrogen]);
AQ-3, PM10 [respirable particulate matter with an aerodynamic resistance diameter of 10 micrometers or less];
AQ-4, Visibility;
AQ-5, U.S. 50 Traffic Volumes;
AQ-6, Wood Smoke Emissions;
AQ-7, Vehicle Miles Traveled; and
AQ-8, Atmospheric Nutrient Loading.

In 2006, the AQ-1, AQ-2, AQ-3, and AQ-7 thresholds were designated “non-attainment”; the AQ-4 and AQ-5
thresholds were designated “attainment”; and the AQ-6 and AQ-8 thresholds were designated “unknown.” In
2011, the AQ-1 threshold was in attainment, AQ-2, AQ-3, AQ-4, AQ-5 and AQ-7 thresholds were still in “nonattainment,” AQ-6 and AQ-8 are still designated as “unknown.” The thresholds for air quality are established for
long-term operational emissions only. Therefore, temporary, short-term construction-related emissions are not
considered in determining compliance with TRPA thresholds.
As stated for Impact 3.2-2 (Alternatives 1–4), implementing the project would not cause any long-term
operational emissions thresholds set by TRPA to be exceeded. Thus, long-term operational emissions of criteria
air pollutants (ozone [ROG and NOX] and PM10) would not violate the air quality standards established by
thresholds AQ-2 and AQ-3. Subsequently, because the AQ-4, AQ-7, and AQ-8 thresholds are based on the
formation of criteria air pollutants (visibility: ozone and PM10; vehicle miles traveled: ozone; and atmospheric
nutrient loading: NOX), they also would not be violated by long-term project operation.
As stated for Impact 3.2-3 (Alternatives 1–4), implementing the project would not cause long-term levels of
service to deteriorate at any intersection or on any route, including U.S. 50. Thus, long-term operational (local)
emissions of carbon monoxide by mobile sources and resulting changes in level of service (i.e., on U.S. 50)
related to the project would not violate the air quality standards established by thresholds AQ-1 and AQ-5.
No long-term operational sources of wood smoke emissions are associated with any of the project alternatives.
Thus, the project would not affect threshold AQ-6.

4.6.2

WATER QUALITY

Seven narrative and numerical water quality thresholds have been established by TRPA:
►
►
►
►

WQ-1, Littoral Lake Tahoe, Turbidity;
WQ-2, Pelagic Lake Tahoe, Winter Water Clarity;
WQ-3, Pelagic Lake Tahoe, Phytoplankton Primary Productivity;
WQ-4, Tributaries, Tributary Water Quality;

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

4-7

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Other Required Sections

►
►
►

WQ-5, Surface Water, Runoff Water Quality;
WQ-6, Groundwater; and
WQ-7, Other Lakes.

None of the project alternatives (Alternatives 1–5) would produce a discernible effect on four of the TRPA water
quality thresholds: WQ-1, Littoral Lake Tahoe, Turbidity (attainment); WQ-2, Pelagic Lake Tahoe, Winter Water
Clarity (non-attainment); WQ-3, Pelagic Lake Tahoe, Phytoplankton Primary Productivity (non-attainment); and
WQ-7, Other Lakes (non-attainment). Therefore, these thresholds are not discussed further.
Water quality thresholds are applied basinwide; that is, the entire Tahoe Basin is considered in attainment or in
non-attainment. However, spatial data by stream, lake, or other water body are tracked, and local attainment status
is reported by TRPA. No spatially discrete targets have been established. The three directly related water quality
thresholds all have a “non-attainment” status. Implementing any of the action alternatives would not adversely
affect or interfere with attainment of any of TRPA’s seven water quality thresholds. The relevant thresholds are
discussed in more detail below.

WQ-4, TRIBUTARIES, TRIBUTARY WATER QUALITY
The TRPA tributaries threshold is intended to attain state standards for nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and a 90th
percentile value for suspended sediment of 60 milligrams per liter. The WQ-4 threshold is in non-attainment.
Using the 2011 threshold evaluation, the status is somewhat worse than target, and the trend is moderate
improvement (TRPA 2012).
A major goal of the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project is the reduction of fine sediment (and
associated nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorous, and iron) production and transport in the study area. This
goal is addressed by the design elements of Alternatives 1–4 that reduce fine sediment sources in the study area
and promote fine sediment retention on the Upper Truckee River floodplain. Although the magnitude of both the
reduction in fine sediment generated and the increase in sediment retained on the floodplain cannot be accurately
quantified, the reduction of sediment sources and increased sediment retention in the study area would reduce the
transport of fine sediment to Lake Tahoe, directly supporting the TRPA goal of decreasing the sediment load to
the lake. A significant contributing element for the reduction of sediment production is the creation of more stable
channel segments and the removal/abandonment of existing unstable channel segments. Implementing Alternative
1, 2, 3, or 4 would increase the length of “geomorphically sized” (and inherently more stable) channels through
modifications of existing channel segments and construction of new segments. The channel geometry in the
improved segments would be designed to reduce channel instability and related erosion of the channel bed and
banks. With the increase in the length of “geomorphically sized” channels (relative to existing conditions) used as
a measure of improved channel stability, the action alternatives would be ranked in descending order as follows:
Alternative 1 (6,200 feet), Alternative 2 (5,650 feet), Alternative 3 (5,080 feet), and Alternative 4 (3,400 feet).
Additionally, implementing any of the action alternatives would promote increased retention of sediment in the
study area by improving floodplain connectivity for the Upper Truckee River and by increasing the frequency and
duration of channel overbanking and the area of floodplain inundation during high-frequency flooding events. The
increased floodplain connectivity (and opportunity for floodplain retention) would be realized as a combination of
raising the existing channel bed (Alternatives 1, 2, and 3) and constructing inset (lowered) floodplain areas or
terraces (Alternatives 1, 2, 3, and 4). The effect of both of these actions would be to increase the area of the study
area more frequently inundated during seasonal high-flow events. With the estimated increase in the area
inundated during a two-year flow event used as a measure of increased opportunity for deposition of fine
sediment in the study area, the action alternatives would be ranked in descending order as follows: Alternative 3
(91 acres), Alternative 2 (61 acres), Alternative 4 (17 acres), and Alternative 1 (11 acres).
Each action alternative would also include installation of bank protection for the Upper Truckee River
downstream of the U.S. 50 bridge (generally between River Stations 0+00 and 12+00). The bank protection would

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

stabilize eroding banks or banks with a high susceptibility to erosion, thereby reducing sediment production and
turbidity. Based on the length of protected bank, implementing Alternative 1 or 4 would provide the most
protection, and implementing Alternative 2 or 3 would provide the least.
As described above, implementing any of the action alternatives would reduce sediment sources and provide
opportunities for increased floodplain retention relative to existing conditions. These improved conditions would
be expected to reduce fine sediment loading to the Upper Truckee River in the study area and result in the
increased retention of fine sediment transported into the study area. In general, implementing any of the action
alternatives would contribute to attainment of the WQ-4 threshold.
Alternative 5 (the No-Project/No-Action Alternative) would not include any specific measures to be implemented
in the study area that would reduce sediment and nutrient loading to the Upper Truckee River and, ultimately,
Lake Tahoe. Existing conditions, which include river channel instability and reduced floodplain connectivity with
the river, would persist. These conditions would result in continued elevated sediment loading in the Upper
Truckee River. Relative to Alternatives 1, 2, 3, and 4, Alternative 5 would have the least potential to reduce
sediment loading and would not contribute to attainment of the WQ-4 threshold.

WQ-5, SURFACE WATER, RUNOFF WATER QUALITY
The WQ-5 threshold, including TRPA standards focused on limiting nitrogen, phosphorous, iron, grease, oil, and
suspended sediment in stormwater surface water discharges, is in non-attainment. Implementing Alternative 1, 2,
3, or 4 would require extensive grading and construction activities over an approximately four-year construction
period. The construction activities would result in removal of vegetation and disturbance of surface soils and
underlying floodplain sediments. This disturbance could potentially result in short-term increased erosion hazards
in disturbed areas. Under all the action alternatives, construction would result in a temporary increase in the risk
of releases of fuel, lubricants, and other hazardous substances related to the operation of heavy equipment.
However, compliance with existing regulations regarding the control of stormwater discharges for construction
activities would be required under all the action alternatives. Environmental Commitment 5 would be
implemented to protect water quality during the construction period.
Proposed recreational facilities (including the kiosk, trails, viewpoints and observation areas, and fishing
platforms) for all the action alternatives would be accessible by foot or bicycle. These facilities would not
introduce significant new sources of stormwater contaminants. Runoff from impervious structures (i.e., pavement)
would require collection and treatment (e.g., infiltration) to minimize discharge of stormwater.
Alternative 2 or 3 would include creation of stormwater treatment areas at the eastern margin of the study area.
These treatment areas would be included to provide for the management/treatment of stormwater that enters the
study area from developed areas to the east. This provision is a benefit of implementing Alternative 2 or 3,
allowing treatment of stormwater generated from off-site sources.
Required compliance with existing regulations would mitigate potential increases in stormwater pollutants
associated with implementing any of the action alternatives. Additionally, the action alternatives would provide
increased opportunity for retention of fine sediment and associated nutrients on the Upper Truckee River
floodplain in the study area (see discussion of the WQ-4 threshold, above). The combined effect of specific
stormwater controls for proposed recreational facilities and the increased opportunity for treatment of Upper
Truckee River flows would contribute to the attainment of the WQ-5 threshold under Alternative 1, 2, 3, or 4.
Relative to existing conditions, Alternative 5 would not result in any improvements for treatment of stormwater
and would not contribute to attainment of the WQ-5 threshold.

WQ-6, GROUNDWATER
The Tahoe Basin is in non-attainment for the WQ-6 threshold, which includes standards focused on limiting
nitrogen, phosphorous, iron, grease, oil, and turbidity in stormwater discharges to groundwater through
infiltration. The goal of the WQ-6 threshold is to generally improve the potential for treatment of stormwater
through groundwater infiltration and reduce nitrogen and phosphorous in groundwater. Data collected for the
2005 Total Maximum Daily Load Best Management Practices Evaluation and Feasibility Study indicate that in
the Lake Tahoe Basin most untreated runoff samples would meet groundwater (or land treatment) standards.
Implementing Alternative 1, 2, 3, or 4 would not introduce any significant sources of nitrogen or phosphorus into
the study area or the Upper Truckee River. Implementation of any of the action alternatives would eliminate most
existing impervious surfaces in the study area and would create a smaller amount of new impervious cover,
resulting in a net decrease in the amount of impervious cover. The new impervious cover would be limited to
paved trails and to kiosks and signs at observation points and view points (Alternative 1, 2, 3, or 4). The proposed
extent of impervious cover would not substantially change (i.e., reduce) the recharge properties of the study area.
All runoff collected from impervious surfaces would be treated in infiltration facilities before it reached
groundwater.
All the action alternatives include modifications to the Upper Truckee River channel in the study area that would
promote more frequent inundation of the floodplain/marsh surface during small and moderate flow events. The
increased frequency and area of inundation during these smaller flood events would promote retention of
sediment and associated nutrients (including nitrogen and phosphorous) on the floodplain, making nutrients
available for uptake by riparian and marsh vegetation. Most of the sediment and nutrients would be transported by
the river into and would not be generated at the study area. Although not directly quantifiable, the uptake of
nutrients would reduce nutrient loading to Lake Tahoe (and therefore reduce the amount of nutrients delivered to
groundwater through infiltration).
Implementing Alternative 1, 2, 3, or 4 would decrease the cover of impervious surfaces in the study area, treat
stormwater runoff before it is discharged to groundwater, and increase opportunities for retention of nutrients on
the Upper Truckee River floodplain. Therefore, implementing any of the action alternatives would generally
benefit the goals of the WQ-6 threshold. Under Alternative 5, the existing conditions would continue therefore,
the attainment of the WQ-6 threshold would not be affected.

4.6.3

SOIL CONSERVATION

Two soil conservation thresholds have been established by TRPA:
►
►

SC-1, Impervious Coverage and
SC-2, Stream Environment Zone, Naturally Functioning SEZ.

SC-1, IMPERVIOUS COVERAGE
This threshold is in non-attainment. It has two components, the first is based on controlling the amount of new
impervious coverage, and the second involves a continuing effort to bring all land coverage into compliance with
Bailey System coefficients. Implementing Alternative 1, 2, 3, or 4 would decrease coverage in the most sensitive
lands (LCD 1b) adjacent to the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek, therefore decreasing existing coverage of
sensitive lands in the watershed. Coverage would be decreased by removing user-created trails in LCD 1b
throughout the study area (Alternatives 1–4) and by removing fill from the TKPOA Corporation Yard and
restoring it to natural vegetation (Alternatives 1–3). Alternatives 1–4 also involve constructing public access and
recreation infrastructure; these elements would be new coverage in LCD 1b around the perimeter of the study
area. Overall, implementing Alternative 1, 2, 3, or 4 would result in a net decrease in coverage in LCD 1b and in
the study area as a whole. Consequently, implementing any of these alternatives would contribute to attainment of
threshold SC-1 by decreasing land coverage. However, coverage allowed in the study area exceeds that allowed

by the Bailey System. Coverage removed would be banked and used for other projects (e.g., bike trails) as
allowed by TRPA. Implementing Alternative 5 would maintain existing conditions and thus would not affect
attainment of threshold SC-1.

SC-2, NATURALLY FUNCTIONING SEZ THRESHOLD
The SC-2 threshold is in non-attainment. It sets the goal of preserving naturally functioning Stream Environment
Zone (SEZ) lands in their natural hydrologic condition, restoring all disturbed SEZ lands in undeveloped lands
and restoring a five-percent increase in the area of naturally functioning SEZ lands (in the TRPA area of
jurisdiction). Nearly all of the study area is designated as SEZ. The primary purpose of the Upper Truckee River
and Marsh Restoration Project is to improve the natural function of the Upper Truckee River and floodplain in the
study area. Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternative 1, 2, 3, or 4) would restore river processes
and functions of the Upper Truckee River and improve connectivity of the river with its floodplain. All the action
alternatives involve preserving and improving natural hydrologic conditions in the study area, and only uses that
are consistent with allowable uses in the SEZ lands are proposed for the alternatives, including Alternative 5. All
the action alternatives are also consistent with the TRPA Environmental Improvement Program, which provides
direction and funding for projects restoring degraded SEZ conditions.
Implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternative 1, 2, 3, or 4) would contribute to the attainment of the
SC-2 threshold. Although implementing Alternative 5 would not degrade existing SEZ lands or propose
inconsistent land uses, implementing this alternative would not contribute to attainment of the SC-2 threshold.

4.6.4

VEGETATION PRESERVATION

Four vegetation thresholds have been established by TRPA:
►
►
►
►

V-1, Common Vegetation;
V-2, Uncommon Plant Communities;
V-3, Sensitive Plants; and
V-4, Late Seral/Old Growth Ecosystems.

V-1, COMMON VEGETATION
The goal of the V-1 threshold is to increase plant and structural diversity of forest communities through
appropriate management practices as measured by diversity indices of species richness, relative abundance, and
pattern. The V-1 threshold includes separate standards for diversity and pattern of vegetation types and relative
abundance for conifer forest types, meadow and wetland vegetation types, and deciduous riparian vegetation types
that are applied basinwide:
►

Provide for the perpetuation of yellow pine forest, red fir forest, subalpine forest, sagebrush scrub, and
cushion plant associations and riparian, marsh, and meadow associations.

►

Maintain at least four percent meadow and wetland vegetation and four percent deciduous riparian vegetation.

►

Maintain no more than 25 percent dominant shrub vegetation.

►

Maintain 15–25 percent of the yellow pine forest in seral stages other than mature.

►

Maintain 15–25 percent of the red fir forest in seral stages other than mature.

►

Limit the acreage size of new forest openings to no more than eight acres.

►

Ensure that adjacent forest openings are not of the same relative age class or successional stage.

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Other Required Sections

Regarding conifer forest, implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternative 1, 2, 3, or 4) would contribute
to attainment of the V-1 threshold. Each of these alternatives involves enhancing forest communities in the study
area by removing and restoring user-created trails.
Regarding deciduous riparian (i.e., willow-wet meadow scrub) and meadow and wetland vegetation (i.e., lagoon
and montane meadow) in the study area, short-term construction-related effects would be avoided or substantially
reduced by implementing measures incorporated into the project as environmental commitments (Table 2-6),
implementing proposed mitigation, or meeting the terms and conditions of permits. Consequently, common
vegetation would not be degraded. Furthermore, implementing any of the action alternatives (Alternative 1, 2, 3,
or 4) would result in long-term increases in the acreage and quality of deciduous riparian vegetation and meadow
and wetland vegetation in the study area. Because the relative abundance threshold for these vegetation types is
presently in non-attainment, implementing any of the action alternatives would contribute to attainment of the V-1
threshold. Implementing Alternative 5 would not improve existing deciduous riparian, meadow, or wetland
vegetation; rather, degradation would continue. Implementing this alternative would not contribute to attainment
of the V-1 threshold.

V-2, UNCOMMON PLANT COMMUNITIES
The V-2 threshold calls for providing nondegradation of the natural qualities of any plant community that is
uncommon to the Tahoe Basin or of exceptional scientific, ecological, or scenic quality. This threshold applies but
is not limited to the deep-water plants of Lake Tahoe, Grass Lake (sphagnum fen), Osgood Swamp, the Freel
Peak Cushion Plant Community, Hell Hole (sphagnum fen), Upper Truckee Marsh, Taylor Creek Marsh, and
Pope Marsh. This threshold applies to the sensitive plant communities of the study area.
The threshold status for V-2 is in non-attainment. The adverse effects of construction activities would be only
short-term and would be avoided or substantially reduced by implementing measures incorporated into the
project, implementing proposed mitigation, or meeting the terms and conditions of permits. Consequently,
uncommon plant communities would not be degraded. Furthermore, all the action alternatives include restoration
and enhancement components that would bring the V-2 threshold closer to attainment. Each project alternative
would increase the acreage of uncommon communities in the study area; enhance uncommon communities by
reducing human disturbance, particularly in a core habitat area; and increase river-floodplain connectivity (e.g.,
the frequency of inundation by floodwaters), which would enhance uncommon communities. Implementing
Alternative 5 would not improve existing uncommon plant communities; rather, degradation would continue.
Thus, implementing this alternative would not contribute to attainment of the V-1 threshold.

V-3, SENSITIVE PLANTS
The goal of the V-3 threshold is to maintain a minimum number of population sites for five TRPA special-interest
plant species: Galena Creek rockcress (Arabis rigidissima var. demota) (seven sites), long-petaled lewisia
(Lewisia longipetala) (two sites), Cup Lake draba (Draba asterophora var. macrocarpa) (two sites), Tahoe draba
(Draba asterophora var. asterophora) (five sites), and Tahoe yellow cress (Rorippa subumbellata) (26 sites). The
threshold status for V-3 is attainment.
Of these plant species, only Tahoe yellow cress is found in the study area. Under any of the action alternatives,
impacts on Tahoe yellow cress plants could include damage to plants during construction activities, loss of habitat
from construction of project features, or subsequent damage to plants as a result of altered recreational activities.
Although these potential adverse effects could occur under Alternative 2, this alternative also involves creating
additional potential habitat for Tahoe yellow cress.
Under the action alternatives, potential impacts from construction activities would be avoided by implementing
Mitigation Measure 3.4-3: Conduct Protocol-Level Preconstruction Surveys and Avoid or Mitigate Impacts on
Tahoe Yellow Cress Plants. If all Tahoe yellow cress plants cannot be avoided, the Conservancy, in coordination

4-12

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS
California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

with the Tahoe Yellow Cress Adaptive Management Working Group, will delineate and fence a mitigation area,
excavate and translocate potentially affected stems, plant additional nursery-grown Tahoe yellow cress plants, and
monitor and adaptively manage the population. (No construction activities would occur under Alternative 5, the
No-Project/No-Action Alternative.)
Unlike Alternatives 2, 3, 4, and 5, implementing Alternative 1 would result in the loss of habitat for Tahoe yellow
cress (along the beach where the boardwalk would be constructed). Although implementing Alternative 1 would
increase the acreage of beach and dune by restoring dunes at Cove East Beach (see Table 3.4-4), most of this
restored vegetation would be dunes up to several hundred feet from the immediate shoreline and may not include
the moist microsites that provide habitat for Tahoe yellow cress.
Under existing conditions, a comprehensive set of measures is being implemented and would continue to be
implemented to maintain the Tahoe yellow cress populations in the study area. These measures also would be
implemented under the action alternatives (Alternatives 1–4) and Alternative 5 (the No-Project/No-Action
Alternative). The measures are components of a Conservancy-adopted management plan for Tahoe yellow cress
in the study area (Conservancy and DGS 2007). For Alternatives 2, 3, 4, and 5, these measures would be
sufficient to prevent recreational activities from having a significant effect on these Tahoe yellow cress
populations. However, for Alternative 1, the management plan’s measures would not prevent effects on the
Barton Beach population site, where a boardwalk would be constructed close to the existing populations and an
increase in visitors is expected. Despite signage, protective measures, and continued implementation of the Tahoe
yellow cress management plan, trampling of plants and other disturbance to Tahoe yellow cress populations are
expected to increase at this location.
For these reasons, implementing Alternative 2, 3, 4, or 5 (the No-Project/No-Action Alternative) would continue
to maintain population sites for Tahoe yellow cress and thus would contribute to continued attainment of the V-3
threshold. Implementation of Alternative 1, however, would result in a significant impact on Tahoe yellow cress
populations and habitat in the study area and therefore may not continue to maintain all population sites for Tahoe
yellow cress in the study area. Therefore, implementing Alternative 1 would not contribute to continued
attainment of the V-3 threshold and could result in nonattainment of this threshold.

V-4, LATE SERAL/OLD GROWTH ECOSYSTEMS
The goal of the V-4 threshold is to attain and maintain a minimum percentage of 55 percent by area of forested
lands in the Tahoe Basin in a late seral or old-growth condition, distributed across elevation zones. Forested lands
in TRPA-designated urban areas are excluded from the calculations for threshold attainment. The threshold status
for the V-4 threshold is non-attainment.
The study area is in an urban area not included in attainment calculations and does not contain any late seral/oldgrowth forest. Implementing any of the five alternatives would not affect the attainment status of this threshold.
Because of the long period over which late seral/old-growth ecosystems develop, project implementation under
any of the alternatives also would not contribute to attainment of the V-4 threshold.

4.6.5

FISHERIES

Four fisheries thresholds have been established by TRPA:
►
►
►
►

F-1, Lake Habitat;
F-2, Stream Habitat;
F-3, Instream Flows; and
F-4, Lahontan Cutthroat Trout.

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS

F-1, LAKE HABITAT
The goal of the F-1 threshold is to apply a nondegradation standard to fish habitat in Lake Tahoe and achieve the
equivalent of 5,948 total acres of excellent (prime) habitat. According to TRPA (1982a), “[t]he quality of the lake
can be evaluated and tested against the threshold using measures of habitat disturbance and substrate conditions.”
TRPA (1982a) also considered moderate to heavy boat traffic as disturbance that significantly contributed to the
decline of lake fish habitat quality. The indicator for the F-1 threshold standard was later identified by TRPA as
“[p]hysical disturbance of rocky substrate (acres)” and also considered the rearrangement or clearing of near shore
substrate to accommodate beach use during low lake levels as disturbance to fish habitat and thus a degradation of
fish habitat conditions (TRPA 1996). However, because of challenges associated with defining and measuring
“disturbed rocky substrates” TRPA subsequently measured and reported on the extent and distribution of rocky
substrates (“prime” fish habitat in the littoral zone) in their 2006 Threshold Evaluation. It was felt that this
approach more directly addressed whether the management target of 5,958 acres was achieved (TRPA 2012).
The current status of this threshold is non-attainment, although based on remote sensing data collected and
analyzed from 2002, the region has reached about 94% of the management target of 5,948 acres (TRPA 2012).
Implementing Alternative 5 would not change fish habitat conditions in the lake; therefore, implementing this
alternative would not affect attainment of the F-1 threshold. Implementing Alternative 1, 2, 3, or 4 would reduce
suspended sediment loads to Lake Tahoe that originate from the study area. Therefore, implementing any of these
alternatives could contribute to attainment of the F-1 threshold.

F-2, STREAM HABITAT
The goal of the F-2 threshold is to “maintain 75 miles of excellent, 105 miles of good, and 38 miles of marginal
stream habitat,” for streams classified as residential and migratory and as indicated by the map on page 76 of the
EIS for the Establishment of Environmental Thresholds (TRPA 1982b). Past evaluations (1991 and 1996) of
stream habitat quality used a list of subjective evaluation criteria. Each threshold stream (defined as those streams
in the Lake Tahoe Region designated by TRPA as residential or migratory (TRPA 1982a; TRPA 2012, stream
habitat map) was scored according to criteria used to conclude the relative condition of each stream. The resulting
score for a particular length of stream was then fitted into one of three classes—excellent, good, or marginal—and
the overall mileage of that stream segment was calculated. According to TRPA documents, it was unclear which
fish species group the classification scheme was relevant to (e.g., suckers, trout, all). Consequently, because the
criteria used in the classification scheme appeared biased toward salmonid life histories, an assumption was made
that the classification scheme was most relevant to trout species. Based on the availability of data, past
evaluations have used different criteria to draw conclusions on the conditions of different streams. For example,
biological data were not available for the 1996 Threshold Evaluation; therefore, those criteria were dropped from
the condition assessment of all threshold streams. In the 2001 Threshold Evaluation Report, because no field
effort had been conducted since 1996, the professional opinions of Fisheries Technical Advisory Group members
were used to report on the condition of stream habitat. Similarly, the 2006 Threshold Evaluation of stream habitat
was hampered because of a lack of field effort to assess fisheries conditions (TRPA 2007).
The current status of this threshold is unknown because of lack of data (TRPA 2007, 2012). Implementing
Alternative 5 would not change stream habitat conditions in the study area; therefore, implementing this
alternative would not affect the attainment status of the F-2 threshold. Implementing Alternative 1, 2, 3, or 4
would improve stream habitat conditions in the Upper Truckee River to varying degrees and would contribute to
the attainment of threshold F-2.

F-3, INSTREAM FLOWS
The F-3 threshold states that “until instream flow standards are established in the Regional Plan to protect fishery
values, a nondegradation standard shall apply to instream flows.” The original evaluation criterion for the
instream flow threshold standard is found in TRPA (1982a), which states, “It can be evaluated for compliance by
AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Other Required Sections

4-14

UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS

monitoring the number of new diversions and changes in points of diversion.” TRPA states that the indicator of
instream flows is “evaluated by use of an in-stream beneficial use assessment, such as the type established by
Title 23, Section 670.6 of the California Administrative Code” (TRPA 1996). An interim indicator and standard
was adopted in the 2001 TRPA Threshold Evaluation because TRPA’s staff has not had the technical ability or
the staffing capacity to generate instream beneficial use assessments for each threshold stream. The interim
indicator and standard is consistent with TRPA (1982b) to ensure that TRPA-reviewed and -permitted
projects/activities do not jeopardize streamflows for fish. Thus, this evaluation quantifies the number of
applications for diversions and lake transfers filed with TRPA as an indicator of maintenance of streamflow
conditions in the region. Additionally, a summary of research completed by Desert Research Institute on
streamflow condition is provided in this evaluation (Tracy and Rost 2003).
The current status of the threshold is attainment. Implementing any of the project alternatives, including
Alternative 5, would not change instream flows in the Upper Truckee River. Therefore, it would not affect the
attainment status of the F-3 threshold.

F-4, LAHONTAN CUTTHROAT TROUT
The goal of the F-4 threshold is to “support, in response to justifiable evidence, state and federal efforts to
reintroduce Lahontan cutthroat trout.” The current status of the threshold is attainment. Implementing Alternative
5 would not change habitat conditions for Lahontan cutthroat trout in the study area; therefore, implementing this
alternative would not affect attainment of the F-4 threshold. Implementing Alternative 1, 2, 3, or 4 would improve
stream habitat conditions in the Upper Truckee River to varying degrees for native fish species, including
Lahontan cutthroat trout; therefore, it would contribute to further attainment of the F-4 threshold. All of the action
alternatives support the 2012 TRPA recommendations to continue efforts to restore and enhance stream habitat
conditions.

4.6.6

WILDLIFE

Two wildlife habitat thresholds have been established by TRPA:
►
►

W-1, Wildlife Species of Special Interest, and
W-2, Habitats of Special Significance.

W-1, WILDLIFE SPECIES OF SPECIAL INTEREST
The goal of the W-1 threshold is to provide a minimum number of population sites for six TRPA special-interest
wildlife taxa: northern goshawk (12 sites), osprey (four sites), bald eagle (two winter sites and one nesting site),
golden eagle (four sites), peregrine falcon (two sites), and waterfowl (18 sites). Mule deer is also a special-interest
species; however, no number of sites has been specified for deer. Perching and nesting sites of special-interest
bird species shall not be physically disturbed. TRPA maintains a nondegradation standard within buffer zones
(“disturbance zones”) around nest sites of these species. In areas outside existing urban areas, projects or land
uses in the disturbance zones shall not, directly or indirectly, significantly affect the habitat or cause the
displacement or extirpation of the population. Habitat in disturbance zones shall not be manipulated in any
manner, except for habitat enhancement. The disturbance zone for northern goshawk and bald eagle is a 0.5-mile
radius around each nest site; the disturbance zone for osprey, peregrine falcon, and golden eagle is a 0.25-mile
radius around each nest site. TRPA has also mapped disturbance zones for wintering bald eagles. Disturbance
zones for deer are meadows. This threshold is in non-attainment status for deer, waterfowl, and northern goshawk
and bald eagle nesting and wintering sites, but it is near attainment for bald eagle wintering sites and goshawk.
The threshold status is unknown for golden eagle and peregrine falcon. The nondegradation standard in wildlife
disturbance zones does not apply to situations where these species select areas close to developed parcels.

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Other Required Sections

A designated bald eagle winter site and a waterfowl site are located in the study area. Implementing any of the
action alternatives would not degrade the bald eagle wintering site because construction activities would not occur
during winter or otherwise affect perch sites, and winter recreational activities would remain at levels comparable
to existing levels, which have not interfered with bald eagle use of the study area. (Under Alternative 5, the NoProject/No-Action Alternative, construction activities would not occur, and recreational activities would remain at
a level comparable to existing conditions.) Implementing any of the action alternatives would not degrade
conditions for waterfowl because short-term disturbances or loss of nesting waterfowl would be minimized by
conducting preconstruction surveys and implementing avoidance measures. Recreation-related effects on
waterfowl would remain comparable to or be reduced from existing conditions through habitat protection
components and through decommissioning and restoration of user-created trails, and waterfowl habitat would be
improved through ecosystem restoration of the river-floodplain system. Under Alternatives 1 and 2, additional
lagoon habitat would also be created, which would benefit waterfowl. (Under Alternative 5, construction and
ecosystem restoration would not occur, so recreational activities would remain comparable to existing conditions.)
Therefore, implementing any of these alternatives would not affect the attainment status of the W-1 threshold,
except with regard to waterfowl, for which conditions would be improved.

W-2, HABITATS OF SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE
The goal of the W-2 threshold is to apply a nondegradation standard to habitats consisting of deciduous trees,
wetlands, and meadows while providing for opportunities to increase the acreage of riparian and wetland
associations. These opportunities include but are not limited to preserving existing naturally functioning SEZ
lands in their natural hydrologic condition; restoring all disturbed SEZ lands in undeveloped, unsubdivided lands;
and restoring 25 percent of the SEZ lands that have been identified as disturbed, developed, or subdivided, to
attain a five-percent total increase in the naturally functioning SEZ land. This threshold is in a non-attainment
status. River and floodplain restoration under any of the action alternatives and lagoon restoration under
Alternatives 1 and 2 would enhance the quality and increase the size of riparian, wetland, and aquatic habitat.
Therefore, implementing any of these alternatives would contribute to attainment of the W-2 threshold. No habitat
restoration would occur under Alternative 5, so implementing this alternative would not contribute to attainment
of this threshold.

4.6.7

SCENIC

Four scenic thresholds have been established by TRPA:
►
►
►
►

SR-1, Travel Route Ratings;
SR-2, Scenic Quality Ratings;
SR-3, Public Recreation Areas and Bike Trails; and
SR-4, Community Design.

SR-1, Travel Route Ratings
The TRPA travel route rating threshold tracks long-term cumulative changes to views seen from federal and state
highways in urban, transitional, and natural landscapes in the region and changes to views seen from Lake Tahoe,
looking toward the shore (TRPA 1998). Roadways have been divided into 53 travel segments (called “roadway
travel units”), each representing a continuous two-directional viewshed of similar visual character. Lake Tahoe’s
shoreline is divided into 33 separate “shoreline travel units.” Roadway travel units are rated using the following
six threshold criteria, and shoreline travel units are rated using criteria 1, 5, and 6:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Human-made features along roadways and shoreline
Physical distractions to driving along roadways
Roadway characteristics
Views of the lake from roadways

5. General landscape views from roadways and shoreline
6. Variety of scenery from roadways and shoreline
SR-1 is in non-attainment. However, for the City of South Lake Tahoe, SR-1 status is trending in the positive
direction as a result of improvements in commercial and urban districts and shorezone units. Under Alternative 2,
3, 4, or 5, few project facilities would be visible from these travel units, and with the use of screening and natural
colors and textures, the alternatives would meet the TRPA contrast rating and be consistent with moving towards
attainment of the SR-1 threshold. However, construction of the proposed bridge under Alternative 1 would
degrade views from Shoreline Travel Unit 33 and the lake. Although TRPA-approved colors and screening would
be used to minimize the appearance of the bridge, these measures would not fully screen the views of this public
access facility. Alternative 1 would not be consistent with the SR-1 threshold and would not assist with moving
this threshold towards attainment status.

SR-2, Scenic Quality Ratings
The purpose of the TRPA scenic quality threshold is to maintain or enhance views of individual existing scenic
resources. The scenic resources in the region include the views of the natural landscape and distinctive natural
features that were identified, mapped, described, and evaluated as part of the 1982 Scenic Resource Evaluation.
The subcomponents that make up the scenic resources are:
►

foreground, middle-ground, and background views of the natural landscape from roadways;

►

views to Lake Tahoe from roadways;

►

views of Lake Tahoe and natural landscape from roadway entry points into the region;

►

unique landscape features, such as streams, beaches, and rock formations that add interest and variety, as seen
from roadways;

►

views of the shoreline, the water’s edge, and the foreground as seen from the lake;

►

views of the backdrop landscape, including the skyline, as seen from the lake; and

►

visual features seen from the lake that are points of particular visual interest on or near the shore.

Numerical scenic quality ratings are derived for each mapped scenic resource, using four visual indicators as
subcomponents of the composite rating: unity, vividness, variety, and intactness. According to TRPA’s 2001
Threshold Evaluation (TRPA 2002), unity is the degree to which the visual resources of a scene join together to
form a single, coherent, harmonious unit. Vividness is a measure of contrasting elements, such as color, line, and
shape, marked differences seen as related, or repetition of similarities (sometimes referred to as distinctiveness).
Variety is numerous or different parts seen together and can be referred to as richness. Intactness describes the
degree to which a landscape retains its natural condition or the degree to which modifications emphasize or
enhance the natural condition of the landscape.
These four indicators are each rated on a scale from zero (absent) to three (high). The ratings for all four
indicators are summed to yield the scenic quality threshold rating. Each resource is defined by the length of the
resource and the areas seen from that unit.
SR-2 is in non-attainment but is near attainment status. For the Tahoe Basin, SR-2 status is trending in the
positive direction through improvements in commercial and urban distracts and shorezone units. No specific
changes in the City of South Lake Tahoe were identified in the 2006 threshold evaluation report. Under
Alternative 2, 3, 4, or 5, few project facilities would be visible from these travel units, and with the use of
screening and natural colors and textures, the alternatives would meet the TRPA contrast rating and be consistent

with moving towards attainment of the SR-2 threshold. However, construction of the proposed bridge under
Alternative 1 would degrade views from Shoreline Travel Unit 33 and the lake. Although TRPA-approved colors
and screening would be used to minimize the appearance of the bridge, these measures would not fully screen the
views of this public access facility. Alternative 1 would not be consistent with the SR-2 threshold and would not
assist with moving this threshold towards attainment status.

SR-3, Public Recreation Area Scenic-Quality Threshold
The TRPA threshold for scenic quality of public recreation areas applies to specific public recreation areas,
including beaches, campgrounds, ski areas, and segments of Class I and Class II bicycle trails. Public recreation
areas with views of scenic resources are valuable because they are major public gathering places, hold high scenic
values, and are places where people are static (compared to people on the travel routes) and have more time to
focus their attention on the views and scenic resources.
Scenic resources as seen from the public recreation areas are composed of the following subcomponents:
►
►
►

views of the lake and natural landscape from the recreation area;
views of natural features in the recreation area; and
views of human-made features in or adjacent to the recreation area that influence the viewing experience.

SR-3 is in non-attainment but is near attainment status. Threshold SR-3 does not apply to Alternatives 1–5
because no TRPA-designated public recreation areas have direct views of the study area.

SR-4, Community Design
The community design threshold is a policy statement that applies to the built environment and is not restricted to
roadways or shoreline units. Design standards and guidelines found in the Code of Ordinances, the Scenic Quality
Improvement Program, and the adopted community plans provide specific implementation direction. To secure
threshold attainment, design standards and guidelines must be widely implemented to improve travel route ratings
and produce built environments compatible with the natural, scenic, and recreational values of the region. The
visual quality of the built environment has also become an issue of increasing importance to residents, local
businesses, and community leaders. Because the early design and signage policies of the local governments and
TRPA were inadequate, there was a critical need to develop greater sensitivity to site design and visual impacts to
protect the lake’s future as a premiere vacation area. The Goals and Policies contain a Community Design
Subelement in the Land Use Element, which sets forth policies for new and existing development.
The community design threshold is implemented in two ways. First, the community plan and redevelopment plan
process has been used to develop design standards and guidelines that are tailored to the needs and desires of
individual communities. The standards are considered “substitute” standards because they replace all or portions
of TRPA ordinances adopted to regulate the same subject. This process has been used extensively throughout the
region to provide community-specific sign standards, but it has also addressed issues such as building height and
architectural design guidelines. Second, the site planning and design principles contained in the ordinances and
guidelines are implemented as part of individual development or redevelopment projects and are reviewed and
approved by TRPA and local government.
All elements of Alternatives 2, 3, 4, and 5 would conform to all applicable design standards and guidelines and be
consistent with the SR-4 threshold. Except for the proposed bridge over the Upper Truckee River, all elements of
Alternative 1 also would conform to all applicable design standards and guidelines. The proposed bridge would
degrade views from Shoreline Travel Unit 33 and the lake. Although TRPA-approved colors and screening would
be used to minimize the appearance of the bridge, these measures would not fully screen the views of this public
access facility. Alternative 4 would not be consistent with this threshold.

NOISE

Three noise thresholds have been established by TRPA:
►
►
►

N-1, Aircraft Noise;
N-2, Single Event Noise; and
N-3, Community Noise Equivalent Levels.

The status of the N-1 threshold is “unknown.” Thresholds N-2 and N-3 have a “non-attainment” status.
Implementing the project would not adversely affect attainment of any of these thresholds. None of the
alternatives would affect the attainment of threshold N-1 because none would involve altering aircraft operations.
The attainment of threshold N-2 also would not be affected because none of the alternatives would involve
creating or contributing to single-event noise sources as defined in the TRPA Environmental Threshold Carrying
Capacity Noise Standards for Single Events (Table 3.11-2). Although implementing any of the action alternatives
would affect short-term and long-term noise levels, none would affect attainment of threshold N-3. Implementing
Alternative 1, 2, 3, or 4 would increase noise levels in the short term because construction equipment would be
used to perform restoration activities and in the long term because visitor use would increase; however,
construction noise would be exempt under the TRPA Code of Ordinances, and visitor noise would be insufficient
to cause noise increases at nearby sensitive receptors and thus would not alter community noise equivalent levels
as defined by TRPA (Table 3.11-3). Alternative 5 would be consistent with noise thresholds.

4.6.9

RECREATION

Two qualitative recreation thresholds have been established by TRPA:
►
►

R-1, High Quality Recreational Experiences, and
R-2, Fair Share of Resource Capacity.

R-1, High Quality Recreational Experiences
Threshold R-1 consists of two parts: (1) preservation and enhancement of a high-quality recreation experience and
(2) the provision of additional high-quality, undeveloped lands for recreation, including lake access. The R-1
threshold is in attainment (TRPA 2007).
The attainment of this threshold standard is evaluated by considering the experience of recreation users and by
considering public access to Lake Tahoe and to other natural features. TRPA’s 2012 Threshold Evaluation
considers threshold R-1 to be in attainment based on the results of recreation surveys conducted by TRPA and
recreation providers, improvements in the quality of recreation facilities, increases in the amount of shoreline
accessible to the public, and increases in access to other lands and recreation opportunities, including additional
bike paths that are accessible to the public in the basin. In 2001, the R-1 threshold was determined to be in nonattainment (TRPA 2007:10–8). However, based on an increase in publicly owned shoreline and additional bicycle
and multi-use trails, the 2006 Threshold Evaluation determined the R-1 threshold to be in attainment (TRPA
2007:10–4 to 10-8).
The temporary and short-term effects related to the construction of any of the action alternatives would not
adversely affect the attainment status of the R-1 threshold. Construction activities would be managed to avoid
long-term effects on high-quality undeveloped shorezone and other natural areas. Although construction activities
would preclude access to portions of the study area during the short term, pedestrian access that bypasses areas of
active construction would be maintained. Additional, dispersed recreation opportunities in the surrounding areas
would accommodate recreation opportunities displaced from the study area. Because implementing any of the
action alternatives would have only minor, short-term construction-related effects access to recreation resources,
these effects would not be sufficient to affect the attainment status of the R-1 threshold.

California Tahoe Conservancy/DGS, Reclamation, and TRPA

4-19

AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX
Other Required Sections

The long-term operation of any of the action alternatives also would be consistent with the objectives of the R-1
threshold. Recreation-related amenities would serve to maintain the high quality of the recreational experience in
the study area while also reducing the effects of recreation activities on sensitive natural resources and allowing
the preservation of the more sensitive natural areas in the study area.
Under Alternative 5 (the No-Project/No-Action Alternative), no new facilities would be constructed and no
existing facilities would be altered, expanded, or demolished. Public access to the study area would continue
similar to existing conditions. Therefore, implementing Alternative 5 would be consistent with threshold R-1.

R2, Fair Share of Resource Capacity
The R-2 threshold is intended to ensure that a fair share of the region’s outdoor recreation capacity is available to
the general public. The 2006 Threshold Evaluation considered three indicators for evaluation of the R-2
threshold: (1) cumulative accounts of persons-at-one-time (PAOT) allocations, when applicable; (2) facility
development for recreation projects that do not require PAOT assignments; and (3) land acquisition of new public
lands that support recreation purposes. Overall, based on an assessment of these three indicators, the R-2
threshold is considered to be in attainment (TRPA 2007:10–8).
The action alternatives would involve facility development for public access and recreation. Alternative 1
includes the most elements emphasizing public access and recreation, Alternative 2 the fewest, and Alternatives 3
and 4 intermediate amounts of these elements. Although these facilities would support similar dispersed
recreational uses, they are moving toward developed recreation use (but not as developed as, for example, a
campground or marina). Uses such as the fishing platform (Alternatives 2 and 3) and observation areas and
viewpoints (Alternatives 1, 3, and 4) would require day-use PAOT allocations from the regional pool.
Implementing Alternative 1, 2, 3, or 4 would support the attainment status of threshold R-2 and would not
adversely affect this attainment status because only certain components of certain alternatives would require
PAOT allocations and would be consistent with a fair share of the resource capacity. Under Alternative 1, 2, 3, or
4, the study area would be accessible to and provide recreation opportunities for the general public similar to
existing conditions.
Under Alternative 5 (the No-Project/No-Action Alternative), no new facilities would be constructed and no
existing facilities would be altered, expanded, or demolished. Public access to the study area would continue
similar to existing conditions. Therefore, implementing Alternative 5 would not affect TRPA thresholds related to
recreation.

COMPLIANCE, CONSULTATION, AND COORDINATION

This DEIR/DEIS/DEIS presents a thorough evaluation of the project alternatives, in accordance with CEQA,
NEPA, and TRPA requirements. This chapter describes the proposed project’s compliance with applicable federal
statutes and executive orders and state statutes and regulations in addition to NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA
environmental review provisions. Regulatory setting sections that discuss applicable federal, state, and local laws
and regulations are also included in each of the resource sections (see Chapter 3, “Affected Environment and
Environmental Consequences”).
This chapter also describes the consultation and coordination undertaken to involve the public and agencies
related to the development of the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project and the EIR/EIS/EIS.
These consultations assisted the Conservancy, Reclamation, and TRPA in determining the scope of this
DEIR/DEIS/DEIS, developing program components and objectives, identifying the range of alternatives, defining
potential environmental impacts and the significance of those impacts, and identifying appropriate mitigation
measures. These efforts consist of public scoping meetings and ongoing meetings with agencies to obtain their
input and comments. Conservancy and TRPA will continue to solicit public and agency input on the Upper
Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project by encouraging review of this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS. Past and future
public involvement, consultation, and coordination efforts are discussed in Section 5.3, “Consultation and
Coordination.”

5.1
5.1.1

FEDERAL
FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT OF 1973, AS AMENDED (16 USC
SECTION 1531 ET SEQ.)

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) are charged with
oversight of species designated as threatened or endangered under the Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) of
1973, as amended (16 U.S. Code (USC) 1531 et seq.). The act prohibits “take” of species listed as threatened or
endangered. To “take” a species means to “harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect,
or to attempt to engage in any such conduct.” Habitat modification or degradation that results in death or injury to
listed species by impairing behavioral patterns also constitutes take. USFWS administers the ESA for terrestrial
and freshwater species, and NMFS administers the ESA for marine and anadromous fish species.
Where a proposed project has a federal nexus, compliance with the ESA is through a process described by Section
7 of the ESA. Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA requires federal agencies to consult with USFWS to ensure that they are
not undertaking, funding, permitting, or authorizing actions likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed
species. Regulations jointly issued by USFWS and NMFS guide the consultation process.
When implementing Section 7(a)(2), a federal agency may make one of three possible determinations: no effect,
not likely to adversely affect (NLAA), or may adversely affect (MAA). If the agency determines that
implementing the proposed action would have no effect on listed species and provides a logical rationale for that
determination, then ESA compliance for that action is complete. If the agency makes an NLAA determination,
then it must seek concurrence with that determination from USFWS and/or NMFS. Projects that are wholly
beneficial or have insignificant or unlikely adverse effects merit an NLAA determination. If the agency makes an
MAA determination, then it must enter a formal consultation.
Under Section 7, the consultation process involves producing a biological assessment (BA) to describe the impact
mechanisms and any adverse effects on the listed species. Based on the information contained in the BA, USFWS
and/or NMFS may issue a biological opinion (BO), which states whether or not the federal action is likely to
jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical
habitat. Nonjeopardy BOs include an incidental take statement, describing the amount of “take” that is allowed to

Compliance, Consultation, and Coordination

occur for otherwise lawful activities. BOs also identify “reasonable and prudent measures” that USFWS and
NMFS believe are necessary and appropriate to minimize the effects of implementing a project, as well as terms
and conditions to minimize incidental take or avoid take altogether.
As discussed in Section 3.4, “Biological Resources: Vegetation and Wildlife,” EDAW (now AECOM), on behalf
of the Conservancy, TRPA, and Reclamation, conducted surveys for terrestrial endangered and threatened species
and determined that implementing the proposed project would not result in take of a species federally listed by
USFWS as threatened or endangered. However, implementing the project is expected to result in take of a statelisted species, Tahoe yellow cress, that is also a candidate for federal listing by USFWS. Consequently,
Mitigation Measure 3.4-3, “Conduct Protocol-Level Preconstruction Surveys and Avoid or Mitigate Impacts on
Tahoe Yellow Cress Plants,” would be implemented to avoid or fully mitigate disturbance of Tahoe yellow cress
during construction. Although initial surveys have been conducted, additional preconstruction surveys for Tahoe
yellow cress would be conducted to further assess potential take based on final design. The Conservancy and
Reclamation would also coordinate with USFWS regarding the final design and preconstruction survey results
and would determine the need for formal consultation.
As discussed in Section 3.5, “Fisheries,” Cardno ENTRIX, on behalf of the Conservancy, TRPA, and
Reclamation, conducted surveys for endangered and threatened aquatic species. Lahontan cutthroat trout (LCT)
(Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi), which is federally listed as threatened, was recently reported in the study area
(Lemmers and Santora 2012). However, the two individual fish were determined to be from a group of hatchery
fish that had been released by the Nevada Department of Wildlife (NDOW) into Lake Tahoe near Cave Rock
during Summer 2011. It is uncertain whether a self-sustaining population will persist, but at present, the lake is
considered an occupied water body, and appropriate ESA consultation procedures must be followed before any of
the action alternatives could be implemented. Implementing any of the action alternatives (1–4) would result in
potential take issues in the short term, as well as long-term benefits through improved habitat condition of the
stream, lagoon(s), and floodplain of the study area. The Conservancy and Reclamation have coordinated with
USFWS regarding potential project effects on federally listed and candidate species. Before the record of decision
is issued, the Conservancy and Reclamation would complete informal and, if necessary, formal consultation with
USFWS through Section 7 of the ESA. Thus, because the proposed project includes environmental commitments
and mitigation measures that would avoid or fully mitigate effects on federally listed species, and because the
Conservancy and Reclamation would complete the Section 7 consultation process, the proposed project would
comply with the ESA.

5.1.2

MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT

The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA), first enacted in 1918, domestically implements a series of international
treaties that provide protection for migratory birds. It authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to regulate the taking
of migratory birds and provides that it shall be unlawful, except as permitted by regulations, to pursue, take, or
kill any migratory bird or any part, nest, or egg of any such bird (16 USC 703). This prohibition includes both
direct and indirect acts, although harassment and habitat modification are not included unless they result in direct
loss of birds, nests, or eggs. The current list of species protected by the MBTA includes several hundred species,
which essentially includes all native birds.
Compliance with the MBTA is being addressed through compliance with the ESA and CEQA and through an
additional measure. As discussed in Section 3.4, “Biological Resources: Vegetation and Wildlife,” adverse
impacts on special-status migratory birds would be avoided and effects on other migratory species reduced by
conducting preconstruction surveys and establishing exclusion zones and/or limiting construction activities to the
period outside the breeding season. In addition to these measures, to comply with the MBTA, a preconstruction
survey for migratory bird nests would be conducted to locate and avoid or minimize the loss of active nests during
construction. For construction activities during the nesting season (approximately April 1 to August 15) and
within suitable nesting habitat, a preconstruction survey for active nest sites of migratory birds would be
conducted within 30 days before construction. The survey would be limited to areas where the loss of active nests

could occur as a result of vegetation removal or other ground disturbance. If a migratory bird nest or likely nest
site is located, a buffer around the nest would be avoided until the nest is no longer active.

5.1.3

FEDERAL WATER POLLUTION CONTROL ACT OF 1977 (33 USC 1251 ET
SEQ.)

SECTION 404
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act (CWA), provides for the
restoration and maintenance of the physical, chemical, and biological integrity of the nation’s waters. Section 404
of the act prohibits the discharge of fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands, except as
permitted under separate regulations by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA). Section 404 requires projects to receive authorization from the Secretary of the Army,
acting through USACE, to discharge dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands,
whether the discharge is temporary or permanent. Waters of the United States are generally defined as “waters
which are currently used, or were used in the past, or may be susceptible to use in interstate or foreign commerce,
including all waters which are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide; territorial seas and tributaries to such
waters.” Section 404 is generally applicable to projects for which fill material would be placed within or below
the ordinary high-water mark of a stream. In conjunction with USACE’s CWA Section 404 permits, CWA
Section 401 requires that water quality certifications or waivers be issued by EPA, the states, or both (see below).
Before approval of detailed design used for project construction, a delineation of waters of the United States
(including wetlands) that would be affected by project implementation would be conducted by a qualified
biologist through the formal Section 404 wetland delineation process. The delineation would be submitted to and
verified by the Sacramento District of USACE. Authorization for fill or reconstruction of jurisdictional waters of
the United States, including wetlands, would be secured from the Sacramento District of USACE through the
Section 404 permitting process. Section 404 permitting usually requires the following items:
►

a determination of the volume and types of material to be placed into waters of the United States;

►

a determination of the total area of waters of the United States to be directly and indirectly affected;

►

►

►

►

►

►

a wetland delineation in accordance with the 1987 Wetland Delineation Manual (Environmental Laboratory
1987) and the Western Mountain Regional Supplement (USACE 2008) when a project would impact
wetlands;
a description of habitats, including plant communities, located in the study area;
a description of any environmental impacts that are expected to occur, including methods to avoid, minimize,
or mitigate adverse impacts on water quality or aquatic functions at the project site;
any other information pertinent to the wetland, stream, or water body involved;
for projects involving the restoration of greater than 3 acres of wetlands, evidence that USFWS has been
provided with a courtesy copy of the project notification; and
a copy of the Section 401 water quality certification or waiver issued for the project.

The Conservancy would coordinate with USACE as appropriate and obtain the appropriate permit for
construction of all aspects of the project. All general terms required for permit compliance would be implemented.
Because the project would identify the location of sensitive habitats, minimize impacts, and compensate for any
losses through the permit process, it would comply with Section 404 of the CWA.

SECTION 401
Under CWA Section 401, applicants for a federal license or permit to conduct activities that may result in the
discharge of a pollutant into waters of the United States must obtain certification for the discharge. The
certification must be obtained from the state in which the discharge would originate or, if appropriate, from the
interstate water pollution control agency with jurisdiction over the affected waters at the point where the discharge
would originate. Therefore, all projects that have a federal component and may affect state water quality
(including projects that require federal agency approval, such as issuance of a Section 404 permit) must also
comply with CWA Section 401. In California, the authority to grant water quality certification has been delegated
to the regional water quality control board (RWQCB) with local jurisdiction—in this case, the Lahontan
RWQCB. Water quality certification requires evaluation of potential impacts in light of water quality standards
and CWA Section 404 criteria governing discharge of dredged and fill materials into waters of the United States.
Federal government delegates water pollution control authority under Section 401 to the states. Refer to Section
5.2.8, “Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act.”

SECTION 402
Section 402 of the CWA establishes the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit
program to regulate discharges of pollutants into waters of the United States. A NPDES permit sets specific
discharge limits for point sources discharging pollutants into waters of the United States and establishes
monitoring and reporting requirements, as well as special conditions. The Federal government delegates water
pollution control authority under Section 402 to the states, so the states oversee compliance. Refer to Section
5.2.8, “Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act.”

5.1.4

SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT

The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) (42 USC 300f et seq.) was established to protect the quality of drinking
water in the United States. This law focuses on all waters actually or potentially designated for drinking use,
whether from aboveground or underground sources. The SDWA authorized EPA to establish water quality
standards and required all owners or operators of public water systems to comply with primary (health-related)
standards. State governments, which assume this power from EPA, also encourage attainment of secondary
(nuisance-related) standards. Contaminants of concern in a domestic water supply are those that either pose a
health threat or in some way alter the aesthetic acceptability of the water. These types of contaminants are
regulated by EPA using primary and secondary maximum contaminant levels (MCLs). As directed by the SDWA
amendments of 1986, EPA has been expanding its list of primary MCLs. MCLs have been proposed or
established for approximately 100 contaminants. Furthermore, water used for domestic purposes is required to be
treated by the local or regional water supplier in accordance with federal and state standards, and the proposed
project would not change existing license requirements, impede enforcement of standards, or otherwise affect
drinking water quality. Therefore, the project would be in compliance with any applicable drinking water
standards. Federal government delegates water pollution control authority under the SDWA to the states, so the
states oversee compliance. Refer to Section 5.2.8, “Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act.”

5.1.5

FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS

The Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek through the marsh are regulated as part of the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP) of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Areas of special flood
hazards are identified by FEMA, which issues Flood Insurance Rate Maps showing the regulatory floodplain.
Under the NFIP, FEMA mandates that development cannot occur in the regulatory floodplain (typically the 100year floodplain) if that development would result in a material (more than one foot) increase in the flood
elevation. In addition, no development is allowed in delineated floodways in regulatory floodplains.

In the study area, the CSLT implements federal floodplain regulations through Chapter 34 of the City Code and
the zoning ordinance. The project’s proposed changes to the Upper Truckee River must meet FEMA and CSLT
requirements for floodplain management, and a revised Flood Insurance Rate Map would need to be developed
and submitted to the CSLT and FEMA for approval. A design directive that is more stringent than federal policy
was used to design the proposed project. It states that implementing the proposed project would result in “no net
increase” in the base flood elevation for a 100-year event (Conservancy and DGS 2005:3-2). As discussed in
Section 3.8, “Hydrology and Flooding,” implementing the project would result in less-than-significant or
beneficial effects on flood flows and flood hazards related to the existing floodplain, and the project would be in
compliance with applicable floodplain regulations.

5.1.6

FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT

EPA has been charged with implementing national air quality programs. EPA’s air quality mandates are drawn
primarily from the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA), which was enacted in 1970. The most recent major amendments
made by Congress were in 1990.
The CAA required EPA to establish national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). EPA has established
primary and secondary NAAQS for ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, respirable
particulate matter, fine particulate matter, and lead. The primary standards protect the public health, and the
secondary standards protect public welfare. The CAA was enacted to protect and enhance the nation’s air quality
to promote public health and welfare and the productive capacity of the nation’s population. It requires an
evaluation of any federal action to determine its potential impact on air quality in the project region. California
has a corresponding law that also must be considered during the EIR/EIS/EIS process. (Refer to Section 5.2.1,
“California Clean Air Act.”) Proponents of specific projects must demonstrate that their actions will conform to
the CAA and the State Implementation Plan (SIP). A federal action conforms with an applicable SIP if (1) the
total of direct and indirect emissions from the action are compliant and consistent with the requirements of the
SIP and (2) one of a list of enumerated, pollutant-specific requirements is satisfied (such as accounting for the
Federal action’s projected emission of any criteria pollutant in the SIP or offsetting ozone or nitrogen dioxide
emissions in the nonattainment area) (42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 93.158(a)).
Section 3.2, “Air Quality and Climate Change,” provides an evaluation of the potential impacts on air quality and
Environmental Commitments to reduce those impacts. As described in Section 3.2, with the implementation of
EC 6, “Obtain and Comply with Federal, State, Regional, and Local Permits” (Table 2-7), emissions from the
proposed project would be within the budgets established by the SIP for all criteria air pollutants (Alternatives 1 5). Because Alternatives 1 - 5 were found to comply with the SIP and the project would not contribute
substantially to a violation of the NAAQS, the proposed project would comply with the CAA.

5.1.7

SECTION 106 OF THE NATIONAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION ACT OF 1966, AS
AMENDED (PUBLIC LAW 89-665, 80 STAT. 915, 16 USC SECTION 470 ET
SEQ. AND 36 CFR 18, 60, 61, 63, 68, 79, 800)

The National Historic Preservation Act requires agencies to take into account the effects of their actions on
properties listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historical Places (NRHP). The Advisory
Council on Historic Preservation has developed an implementing regulation (36 CFR 800) that allows agencies to
develop agreements for consideration of these historic properties. Section 106 review includes the scoping,
identification, assessment, and consultation called for in its implementing regulation (36 CFR 800) to determine
impacts on properties listed in or eligible for listing in the NRHP. Consultation under Section 106 takes place
during preparation of an EIS to determine whether historic resources would be adversely affected and, if so,
whether measures could be implemented to reduce adverse effects to a less-than-significant level. Section 106
does not address impacts on all types of cultural resources or all cultural aspects of the environment; it deals only
with impacts on properties listed in or eligible for listing in the NRHP.

Section 106 requires federal agencies to consider the effects of their actions, including those they fund or permit,
on properties that may be eligible for listing or are listed in the NRHP. To determine whether an undertaking
could affect NRHP-eligible properties, cultural resources (archaeological, historic, and architectural properties)
must be inventoried and evaluated for listing in the NRHP. Although compliance with Section 106 is the
responsibility of the lead Federal agency, a qualified representative of the lead agency can conduct the necessary
steps. The Section 106 review process involves a four-step procedure:
►

►

►

►

Establish the undertaking, develop a plan for public involvement, and identify other consulting parties.
Identify historic properties by determining the scope of efforts, identifying cultural resources, and evaluating
their eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP.
Assess adverse effects by applying the criteria of adverse effect on historic properties (resources that are
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP).
Resolve adverse effects by consulting with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and other
consulting agencies, including the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation if necessary, to develop an
agreement that addresses the treatment of historic properties.

In accordance with Section 106 requirements, the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California was contacted
regarding the proposed project, and surveys were conducted to identify cultural resources and evaluate their
eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP.
Studies of the area of potential effect and consultation with the Washoe Tribe and the California SHPO
determined that prehistoric and historic-era sites have been documented in the study area that could be affected by
the proposed alternatives. The prehistoric resources, particularly CA-ELD-26, represent the intensive use of the
lakeshore and the adjacent Upper Truckee River Marsh by the Washoe for fishing, the acquisition of numerous
other lake and marsh resources, and general habitation. Although no subsurface investigations were conducted at
CA-ELD-26, surface indications and detailed ethnographic and historic-era accounts of Washoe occupation at this
location suggest that the site may retain important scientific information. Consequently, CA-ELD-26 appears to
be eligible for listing in the NRHP. No other sites appear to be eligible. A representative of the Washoe Tribe
(Daryl Cruz) has been involved in reviewing previous study findings, the results of archival and field research,
and environmental commitments designed to reduce potential impacts on cultural resources to less-thansignificant levels. Construction of some of the proposed recreational facilities, access/haul roads, and staging
areas has the potential to affect portions of site CA-ELD-26 and/or artifacts and features possibly associated with
this site that have not yet been documented on the landform (bluff) located above the marsh. As described in EC
2, the Conservancy would prepare and implement a cultural resources protection plan. As part of the plan,
construction barriers would be installed around site CA-ELD-26, construction workers would be educated about
site protection requirements, and a qualified cultural resource specialist would oversee initial grading activities in
the vicinity of the bluff (Table 2-7). Furthermore, as part of the final design the bike path will completely avoid
the bluff area and ELD-26/H. These measures have been proposed to address all potential adverse effects on the
eligible resource.
In addition, Reclamation has initiated the Section 106 process for the proposed project and will complete
consultation with the SHPO before the record of decision is issued. For these reasons, the project would comply
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.

5.1.8

INDIAN TRUST ASSETS

Indian Trust Assets (ITAs) are legal interests in property held in trust by the United States for Native American
tribes or individuals. The Secretary of the Interior, acting as the trustee, holds many assets in trust. Examples of
trust assets include lands, minerals, hunting and fishing rights, and water rights over which it has been determined
AECOM and Cardno ENTRIX

that tribes have a historical legal claim. The United States has an Indian trust responsibility to protect and
maintain rights reserved by or granted to Native American tribes or individuals by treaties, statutes, and executive
orders. This duty, founded in law and restated in departmental policy, requires Reclamation to carry out its
activities in a manner that avoids adverse impacts on ITAs when possible. When adverse impacts cannot be
avoided, appropriate mitigation or compensation will be provided. However, there are no such lands in or in the
immediate vicinity of the study area. For this reason, it was determined that the proposed project would have no
impact on ITAs.

5.1.9

FARMLAND PROTECTION POLICY ACT

The Farmland Protection Policy Act of 1981 requires federal agencies to include in an EIS an assessment of
effects on Prime and Unique Farmland, as defined by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and if this
assessment identifies potential effects on the conservation of farmland, to consider alternatives with lesser effects.
The study area is located on State property that is not designated as Prime or Unique Farmland or Farmland of
Statewide Importance, and none of the land is under Williamson Act contract. For this reason, implementing the
project would not result in loss of farmland acreage. Because no impacts on farmland have been identified, the
proposed project would comply with the Farmland Protection Policy Act.

5.1.10

EXECUTIVE ORDER 11988 (FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT)

Executive Order 11988 requires federal agencies to avoid, to the extent possible, adverse impacts associated with
the occupancy and modification of floodplains and to avoid development in floodplains whenever there is a
practical alternative. If a project alternative is found to be in the applicable regulatory floodplain, the agency is
required to prepare a floodplain assessment, known as a statement of findings. The executive order also directs
federal agencies to restore and preserve the natural and beneficial values served by the floodplains (EPA 2010).
Implementing the proposed project would restore portions of the Upper Truckee River floodplain and would not
involve new development in a designated floodplain. In addition, implementing the proposed project would
provide on-site storm drainage facilities and an accompanying stormwater drainage plan to prevent damage from
increased stormwater runoff volumes. Therefore, the project would comply with Executive Order 11988.

5.1.11

EXECUTIVE ORDER 11990 (PROTECTION OF WETLANDS)

Executive Order 11990 established the protection of wetlands and riparian systems as the official policy of the
federal government. It requires all Federal agencies to consider wetland protection as an important part of their
policies and take action to minimize the destruction, loss, or degradation of wetlands and to preserve and enhance
the natural and beneficial values of wetlands. As discussed above in Section 5.1.3, “Federal Water Pollution
Control Act of 1977 (33 USC 1251 et seq.),” a wetland delineation would be prepared for the proposed project
after a preferred alternative is selected, and a Section 404 permit would be obtained before construction begins.
Because the location of sensitive habitats would be identified by a wetland delineation for the construction of all
aspects of the project, Section 404 permit requirements would be complied with, and any losses would be
compensated for, all impacts on wetlands would be avoided, minimized, or mitigated. In addition, implementing
any of the action alternatives would result in a net increase in the amount of wetlands in the study area. Therefore,
the proposed project would comply with Executive Order 11990.

5.1.12

EXECUTIVE ORDER 12898 (ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE)

Executive Order 12898 requires that federal agencies identify and address, as appropriate, disproportionately high
and adverse human health or environmental effects of their actions on minority and disadvantaged populations or
communities. As discussed in Section 3.15, “Socioeconomics, Population and Housing, and Environmental
Justice,” the project would have no disproportionately high and adverse effects on minority or disadvantaged
populations. For this reason, the project would comply with Executive Order 12898.

EXECUTIVE ORDER 13007 (INDIAN SACRED SITES)

Executive Order 13007 requires federal agencies with land management responsibilities to accommodate access
to and ceremonial use of Indian sacred sites by Indian religious practitioners. It also requires that these agencies
avoid adversely affecting the physical integrity of such sacred sites. Among other things, Federal agencies must
provide reasonable notice of proposed actions or land management policies that may restrict future access to or
ceremonial use of, or may adversely affect the physical integrity of, sacred sites. As described in Section 3.3,
“Archaeological and Historical Resources,” cultural resource investigations for the project consisted of a phased
approach that included Native American consultation, prefield research, field reconnaissance surveys, and
resource documentation. Based on the investigations, it was determined that no Indian sacred sites are located in
the study area or its vicinity. Therefore, the proposed project would have no effect on any Indian sacred sites.
Because there would be no impacts, the project would comply with Executive Order 13007.

5.1.14

EXECUTIVE ORDER 13112 (NATIONAL INVASIVE SPECIES MANAGEMENT PLAN)

Executive Order 13112 directs all federal agencies to prevent the introduction and control the spread of invasive,
nonnative species in a cost-effective and environmentally sound manner to minimize economic, ecological, and
human health impacts. It established a national Invasive Species Council made up of federal agencies and
departments and a supporting Invasive Species Advisory Committee composed of State, local, and private
entities. The Invasive Species Council and advisory committee oversee and facilitate implementation of the
executive order. Because the invasive plant management practices included in EC 4, “Prepare and Implement
Invasive Species Management Plan.” would be implemented, the proposed project would comply with this
executive order.

5.1.15

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS MANAGEMENT

EPA is the agency primarily responsible for enforcing and implementing federal laws and regulations pertaining
to hazardous materials. Applicable federal regulations pertaining to hazardous materials are contained mainly in
Titles 29, 40, and 49 of the CFR.
The proposed project involves implementing EC 9, “Develop and Implement a Construction Management
Program,” including a health and safety plan; providing qualified oversight of fill removal in the TKPOA
Corporation Yard as part of Mitigation Measure 3.7-2a (Alts. 1–3); notifying the appropriate federal, state, and
local agencies if contaminated soils are identified (Mitigation Measure 3.7-2b [Alts. 1–3]); and notifying the
school district with jurisdiction within one-quarter mile of the study area regarding potential substances subject to
California Health and Safety Code Section 25532 (EC 9). Furthermore, the Conservancy would continue to
comply with all existing regulations related to hazardous materials management. Therefore, the proposed project
would comply with regulations related to hazardous materials.

5.1.16

TRANSPORT OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

The U.S. Department of Transportation regulates hazardous materials transport between states and is responsible
for protecting the public from dangers associated with transporting these materials. This responsibility is in part
addressed through the training of persons responsible for regulatory compliance, enforcement, and response to
accidents and incidents involving hazardous materials. The proposed project involves implementing EC 9,
“Develop and Implement a Construction Management Program,” including a health and safety plan; providing
qualified oversight of fill removal in the TKPOA Corporation Yard as part of Mitigation Measure 3.7-2a (Alts. 1–
3); notifying the appropriate federal, state, and local agencies if contaminated soils are identified (Mitigation
Measure 3.7-2b (Alts. 1–3); and notifying the school district with jurisdiction within one-quarter mile of the study
area regarding potential substances subject to California Health and Safety Code Section 25532 (EC 9).
Furthermore, the Conservancy would continue to comply with all existing regulations related to hazardous

materials management. Therefore, the proposed project would comply with regulations related to hazardous
materials.

5.1.17

WORKER SAFETY

As described in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 USC 651 et seq.), the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA) of the U.S. Department of Labor is responsible at the federal level for
ensuring worker safety in the handling and use of chemicals. OSHA has adopted numerous regulations pertaining
to worker safety, contained in CFR Title 29. These regulations set standards for safe workplaces and work
practices, including standards relating to hazardous material handling. The proposed project involves
implementing EC 9, “Develop and Implement a Construction Management Program,” including a health and
safety plan; providing qualified oversight of fill removal in the TKPOA Corporation Yard as part of Mitigation
Measure 3.7-2a (Alts. 1–3); notifying the appropriate federal, state, and local agencies if contaminated soils are
identified (Mitigation Measure 3.7-2b [Alts. 1–3]); and notifying the school district with jurisdiction within onequarter mile of the study area regarding potential substances subject to California Health and Safety Code Section
25532 (EC 9). Furthermore, the Conservancy would continue to comply with all existing regulations related to
hazardous materials management. Therefore, the proposed project would comply with regulations related to
hazardous materials.

5.1.18

WILDLIFE HAZARDS TO AIRSPACE SAFETY

Collisions between aircraft and wildlife compromise the safety of passengers and flight crews. Damage to an
aircraft resulting from a wildlife collision can range from a small dent in the wing to catastrophic engine failure
and destruction of the aircraft, along with potential loss of life.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for enforcing 14 CFR 139, which prescribes rules
regarding the operation of airports used by aircraft with seating capacity of more than 30 passengers. FAA roles
and responsibilities relating to wildlife hazards and their associated human health and safety concerns are
addressed in 14 CFR 139.337, Wildlife Hazard Management. An ecological study must be prepared by the
certificate holder and submitted to FAA when multiple birds or other wildlife are struck by aircraft or ingested
into aircraft engines or if the number of birds or other wildlife in an airport flight pattern is sufficient to result in
such hazards. FAA then determines whether a wildlife hazard management plan is needed. FAA’s Office of
Airport Safety and Standards has published advisory circulars and program policy and guidance directives that
further clarify this information. An advisory circular dated August 28, 2007, and titled “Hazardous Wildlife
Attractants on or Near Airports” (Advisory Circular 150/5200-33B) provides guidance on locating certain land
uses having the potential to attract hazardous wildlife to or to the vicinity of public-use airports. FAA
recommends the following separations when siting wildlife attractants (e.g., waste disposal operations,
wastewater treatment facilities, and wetlands) (FAA 2007):
►

5,000 feet from airports serving piston-powered aircraft,

►

10,000 feet from airports serving turbine-powered aircraft, and

►

►

5 miles from airports where the wildlife attractant may cause hazardous wildlife movement into or across the
approach or departure airspace.
Implementing the proposed project would enhance or restore habitat for birds categorized as hazardous
wildlife in terms of the potential for aircraft collisions. The restored habitat in the study area would be located
approximately one mile or more from the airport, which would be outside of the approach/departure zone of
the Lake Tahoe Airport but within the 10,000-foot-wide zone where FAA recommends that wildlife
attractants be minimized. Restoration activities would improve the quality of existing habitat but would not
increase the amount of habitat considered an attractant to wildlife and would not appreciably increase the

Compliance, Consultation, and Coordination

amount of wildlife using the area. Bird-attracting habitats are already present in these locations, and
enhancement and restoration activities are not anticipated to substantially increase the attraction of hazardous
wildlife.
►

►

In addition, Stream Environment Zone restoration, timber management, range management, and management
of fish and wildlife habitat are identified in the Lake Tahoe Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) as
compatible land uses for the clear, approach/departure, and overflight zones of the Lake Tahoe Airport (CSLT
2007:38). Thus, a wide range of management, enhancement, and restoration activities in nearby natural
vegetation are considered compatible with the airport’s operations.
Furthermore, bird strikes have not historically affected aviation safety at the Lake Tahoe Airport. There are no
records of bird-related air strikes in the FAA Birdstrike Database, and no airport staff members recall any
bird-related air strikes (CDM 2007). With or without project implementation, the likelihood of wildlifeaircraft accidents associated with the Lake Tahoe Airport is considered low. Because an increase in wildliferelated hazards is not expected and the proposed land uses are compatible with the CLUP, the proposed
project complies with 14 CFR 139 and 14 CFR 139.337.

5.1.19

EARTHQUAKE HAZARDS REDUCTION ACT OF 1977

The U.S. Congress passed the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act in 1977 to “reduce the risks to life and property
from future earthquakes in the United States” through the establishment and maintenance of an effective
earthquake hazards and reduction program. To accomplish this reduction, the act established the National
Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Act (NEHRPA), which refined the descriptions of agency
responsibilities, program goals, and objectives. The mission of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction
Program is to “develop, disseminate, and promote knowledge, tools, and practices for earthquake risk

reduction—through coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency partnerships among the NEHRP
agencies and their stakeholders—that improve the Nation’s earthquake resilience in public safety,
economic strength, and national security.” The NEHRPA designated FEMA as the program’s lead agency and
assigns several planning, coordinating, and reporting responsibilities. Other NEHRPA agencies are the National
Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Science Foundation, and the U.S. Geological Survey. The
proposed project will comply with NEHRPA through EC 8: Prepare a Final Geotechnical Engineering Report,
and Implement All Applicable Recommendations.

5.2
5.2.1

STATE
CALIFORNIA CLEAN AIR ACT

The California Air Resources Board (ARB) is responsible for coordinating and providing oversight of state and
local air pollution control programs in California and for implementing the California Clean Air Act (CCAA).
The CCAA, which was adopted in 1988, required ARB to establish California ambient air quality standards
(CAAQS). ARB has established CAAQS for sulfates, hydrogen sulfide, vinyl chloride, lead, visibility-reducing
particulate matter, and criteria air pollutants. In most cases, the CAAQS are more stringent than the NAAQS.
Differences in the standards are generally explained by the health effects studies considered during the standardsetting process and the interpretation of the studies. In addition, the CAAQS incorporate a margin of safety to
protect sensitive individuals.
Because implementing and of the action alternatives (Alternative 1- 4) would not contribute substantially to a
violation of the CAAQS through EC 1: Reduce the Generation of Construction-Related Emissions of ROG, NOX,
and PM10, the proposed project would comply with the CCAA.

CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT

The California Endangered Species Act (CESA) was written to protect plant and animal species. Species are listed
as endangered or threatened when their continued existence in California is in jeopardy. CESA and Sections 2050
and 2097 of the California Fish and Game Code prohibit activities that would result in “take” of State-listed and
candidate species without prior authorization from the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG). Under
CESA, “take” is defined as an activity that would directly or indirectly kill an individual of a species. Unlike
under the federal ESA, the CESA definition of “take” does not include “harming” or “harassing”; therefore,
habitat modification is not necessarily considered take under CESA.
CDFG authorization for take can be obtained through an incidental take permit under Section 2081(b) of the
California Fish and Game Code. A 2081(b) permit will authorize take that is incidental to an otherwise lawful
activity as long as the impacts of the authorized take are minimized and fully mitigated. Measures to minimize
and fully mitigate impacts must (1) be roughly proportional in extent to the impact of the taking on the species,
(2) maintain the applicant’s objectives to the greatest extent possible, (3) be implementable, and (4) be adequately
funded to allow implementation and monitoring of compliance.
As discussed in Section 3.4, “Biological Resources: Vegetation and Wildlife,” and Section 3.5, “Fisheries,”
potential effects on species that are state listed as endangered or threatened have been evaluated. Without
mitigation, construction activities of the proposed project could potentially affect willow flycatcher (state listed as
endangered), which has a moderate potential to nest in the study area, and Tahoe yellow cress (also state listed as
endangered), which grows in the study area. This DEIR/DEIS/DEIS identifies two mitigation measures that are
designed to avoid or fully mitigate the take of these State-listed plant and animal species: Mitigation Measure
3.4-8A (Alt. 1–4), “Conduct Preconstruction Surveys for Nesting Special-Status Birds (Yellow Warbler, Willow
Flycatcher, Waterfowl, and Long-Eared Owl), and Implement Buffers If Necessary,” and Mitigation Measure
3.4-3 (Alt. 1–4), “Conduct Protocol-Level Surveys and Avoid or Mitigate Impacts on Tahoe Yellow Cress
Plants.” In addition to implementing these two mitigation measures, the Conservancy is coordinating with CDFG
and, if necessary, would consult with CDFG to obtain a Section 2081(b) permit. Because effects on listed species
would be avoided or fully mitigated and a 2081(b) permit would be obtained before construction begins, the
proposed project would comply with CESA.

5.2.3

CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME CODE SECTION 1602—STREAMBED
ALTERATIONS

Section 1602 of the California Fish and Game Code requires that a streambed alteration agreement be granted
before any action is conducted that may divert or obstruct natural channel flow; substantially change the bed,
channel, or bank of any river, stream, or lake designated by CDFG; or use any material from the streambed of a
CDFG-designated waterway. Implementing the proposed project would require a streambed alteration agreement
from CDFG for work on the bed and banks of the Upper Truckee River and Trout Creek. The Conservancy would
obtain the streambed alteration agreement from CDFG and implement all terms required for permit compliance.
Therefore, the project would be in compliance with California Fish and Game Code Section 1602.

5.2.4

CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME CODE SECTIONS 3503–3503.5—PROTECTION
OF BIRD NESTS AND RAPTORS

Section 3503 of the California Fish and Game Code states that it is unlawful to take, possess, or needlessly
destroy the nest or eggs of any bird. Section 3503.5 specifically states that it is unlawful to take, possess, or
destroy any raptors (i.e., hawks, owls, eagles, and falcons), including their nests or eggs. Typical violations of
these codes include destroying active nests by removing the vegetation in which the nests are located. Disturbance
of nesting pairs by nearby project construction that results in the failure of active raptor nests could also violate
Section 3503.5. As discussed in Section 3.4, “Biological Resources: Vegetation and Wildlife,” without mitigation,

the project’s construction activities could affect nesting birds. This DEIR/DEIS/DEIS identifies mitigation
measures designed to avoid potential impacts on the nests of special-status bird species and waterfowl, and these
measures would also avoid or reduce effects on other nesting birds. In addition, as described above for the
MBTA, a preconstruction survey for migratory bird nests would be conducted to locate and avoid or minimize the
loss of active nests during construction. Through these measures, the project would comply with California Fish
and Game Code Sections 3503–3503.5.

5.2.5

CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANT PROTECTION ACT

In addition to CESA, the California Native Plant Protection Act (CNPPA) provides protection to endangered and
rare plant species, subspecies, and varieties of wild native plants in California. The CNPPA preceded CESA, and
its definitions of “endangered” and “rare” closely parallel the CESA definitions of endangered and threatened
plant species. With the passage of CESA in 1984, plant species determined to be endangered under the CNPPA
were converted to endangered status under CESA. However, as discussed in Section 3.4, “Biological Resources:
Vegetation and Wildlife,” implementation of the project would not involve potential take of plants listed as rare
under the CNPPA.

5.2.6

CALIFORNIA STATE LANDS COMMISSION

The California State Lands Commission (CSLC) was given authority and responsibility to manage and protect the
important natural and cultural resources on certain public lands in the state and the public’s rights to access these
lands. The public lands under the CSLC’s jurisdiction are of two distinct types: sovereign lands and school lands.
Sovereign lands, which encompass approximately four million acres, include the beds of California’s naturally
navigable rivers, lakes (including Lake Tahoe), streams, and the underlying beds, as well as the state’s tidal and
submerged lands along the coastline, extending from the shoreline to three miles offshore. These lands are owned
by the State and held in trust for the benefit of all people. The rights protected include navigation, commerce, and
fisheries uses, as well as the right to fish, hunt, bathe, swim, boat, and engage in general recreation. The trust also
encompasses the right to preserve lands in their natural state for ecological study, as open space, and as bird and
marine habitat. These public rights are inalienable and cannot be extinguished, except to further public trust
purposes generally. In making these choices, the government has the power to make equitable adjustments among
conflicting trust uses.
A project cannot use these state lands unless an easement is first obtained from CSLC. The public-trust easement
in navigable waterways allows lateral access between the high-water line and the low-water line; at Lake Tahoe,
this is the area between the adjudicated ordinary low-water mark, at elevation 6,223 feet Lake Tahoe Datum, and
the ordinary high-water mark, at elevation 6,228.75 feet Lake Tahoe Datum.
Because the bed of Lake Tahoe in the study area is within CSLC jurisdiction, use of the bed of Lake Tahoe would
require an easement from the CSLC. The Conservancy has been coordinating with CSLC as a responsible agency
under CEQA during preparation of this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS.

5.2.7

CALIFORNIA SCENIC HIGHWAY PROGRAM

California’s Scenic Highway Program, created by the California State Legislature in 1963, is managed by the
California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). The goal of this program is to preserve scenic highway
corridors and protect them from changes that would affect the aesthetic value of the land adjacent to highways. A
highway may be designated “scenic,” depending on how much of the natural landscape travelers can see, the
scenic quality of the landscape, and the extent to which development intrudes on travelers’ enjoyment of the view.
Official designation requires a local jurisdiction to enact a scenic corridor protection program that protects and
enhances scenic resources (Caltrans 2008). As discussed in Section 3.14, “Scenic Resources,” portions of U.S. 50
and SR 89 visible from the study area are officially designated as scenic highways; however, the proposed project
would have no significant effects on views from U.S. 50 and SR 89. Because the project would not have a

significant adverse effect on these designated scenic highways, it would comply with the California Scenic
Highway Program.

5.2.8

PORTER-COLOGNE WATER QUALITY CONTROL ACT

The State Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (California Water Code Section 13000 et seq.) requires the
State of California to establish water quality objectives and standards to protect water quality for beneficial uses.
The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) is composed of nine RWQCBs that are responsible for
preserving California’s water quality. The RWQCBs issue waste discharge permits, take enforcement action
against violators, and monitor water quality. SWRCB and the RWQCBs jointly administer most of the CWA
regulations in coordination with EPA and USACE. Under the act, the appropriate RWQCB must prepare and
periodically update a water quality control plan.
The proposed project is under the jurisdiction of the Lahontan RWQCB. The Water Quality Control Plan for the
Lahontan Region (Basin Plan), adopted on March 31, 1995, and as amended, identifies the beneficial uses, water
quality objectives, numerical standards, and waste discharge prohibitions for surface water and groundwater on
the California side of the Lake Tahoe Basin (Lahontan RWQCB 1995:1-1). The Basin Plan incorporates water
quality thresholds, programs, and regulations as developed and implemented by TRPA, along with state and
federal regulations. It states specific water quality objectives for certain water bodies in the Lake Tahoe
Hydrologic Unit. The objectives pertaining to water bodies in the study area are summarized in Table 3.9-2 of
Section 3.9, “Geomorphology and Water Quality.” To achieve those objectives, the Basin Plan identifies
prohibitions against discharges and threatened discharges in 100-year floodplains or below the high-water rim of
Lake Tahoe that apply to portions of the TRPA-defined shorezone. The Lahontan RWQCB has granted an
“exemption to a waste discharge prohibition contained in the Water Quality Plan for the Lahontan Region” to
specifically allow for potential turbidity elevation during the construction of stream restoration projects in the
Lake Tahoe Basin. If necessary, the Conservancy would apply for this exemption.
The Lahontan RWQCB regulates discharge of stormwater from construction sites (as well as stormwater from
municipal and industrial sites) under the CWA Section 402 NPDES program. Because implementing the proposed
project would disturb more than one acre, the Lahontan RWQCB NPDES General Permit Number CAG616002,
which addresses discharge of stormwater from construction sites, would be required. The Conservancy and its
contractors would obtain and comply with this permit. The general types of measures that would be implemented
are discussed as part of the project description, and the Conservancy would implement EC 5, “Prepare and
Implement Effective Construction Site Management Plans to Minimize Risk of Water Quality Degradation and
Impacts to Vegetation,” and EC 6, “Obtain and Comply with Federal, State, Regional, and Local Permits,” to
protect water quality..

5.2.9

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS MANAGEMENT

The California Department of Toxic Substances Control, a division of the California Environmental Protection
Agency (Cal/EPA), has primary regulatory responsibility over hazardous materials in California, working in
conjunction with EPA to enforce and implement laws and regulations regarding hazardous materials. The
Conservancy would comply with applicable Cal/EPA regulations through developing and implementing a
Construction Management Program and complying with permit and regulatory requirements as described in EC 6,
“Obtain and Comply with Federal, State, Regional, and Local Permits,” and EC 9, “Develop and Implement a
Construction Management Program,” and also described in Section 5.1.15, “Hazardous Materials Management.”

5.2.10

WORKER SAFETY

The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal/OSHA) assumes primary responsibility for
developing and enforcing workplace safety regulations in the state. Cal/OSHA standards are more stringent than
federal OSHA regulations and are presented in Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations. Cal/OSHA conducts
UTR and Marsh Restoration Project DEIR/DEIS/DEIS

on-site evaluations and issues notices of violation to enforce necessary improvements to health and safety
practices. The Conservancy would comply with applicable Cal/OSHA regulations through developing and
implementing a Construction Management Program and complying with permit and regulatory requirements as
described in as described in EC 6 and EC 9, and also described in Section 5.1.15, “Hazardous Materials
Management.”

5.2.11

LAND USE AND AIRSPACE SAFETY

The State regulates airports under the authority of the Airport Land Use Commission Law, Section 21670 et seq.
of the California Public Utilities Code. The California Airport Land Use Planning Handbook, published by the
Caltrans Division of Aeronautics (Caltrans 2011), supports this law by providing compatibility planning guidance
to airport land use commissions (ALUCs), counties and cities that have jurisdiction over airport area land uses,
and airport proprietors.
The Airport Land Use Commission Law is implemented through ALUCs, which are required in every county with
a public-use airport or with an airport served by a scheduled airline. Under the provisions of the law, the ALUC
has certain responsibilities conferred upon it and specific duties to perform. Among these duties are preparing
airport land-use plans for each of the airports in its jurisdiction (California Public Utilities Code Sections
21674[c] and 21675[a]). TRPA has been designated as the ALUC by El Dorado County. The CSLT Planning
Commission, when augmented with two additional commission members, has been designated as the ALUC for
the CSLT. The action alternatives (1–4) and Alternative 5 (No-Project/No-Action Alternative) are consistent with
the compatible land uses identified in the CLUP for the clear, approach/departure, and overflight zones of the
Lake Tahoe Airport (CSLT 2007:38).

5.2.12

WILDFIRE HAZARD MANAGEMENT

The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) implements statewide laws aimed at
reducing wildfire hazards in wildland-urban interface areas. The laws are based on fire hazard assessment and
zoning. The laws apply to State Responsibility Areas (SRAs). SRAs are defined as areas of the state in which the
financial responsibility of preventing and suppressing fires has been determined by the State Board of Forestry,
pursuant to California Public Resources Code Sections 4125 and 4102, to be primarily the responsibility of the
State. Fire protection outside SRAs is the responsibility of federal or local jurisdictions. These areas are referred
to by CAL FIRE as Local Responsibility Areas.
The study area is not within an SRA; however, fuel reduction activities initiated by the Conservancy on all
Conservancy-owned lands, including the study area, are completed by Conservancy staff members according to
CAL FIRE recommendations for reducing wildfire hazards. The Conservancy has a registered professional
forester who flags vegetation for removal by Conservancy forestry crews or local fire districts contracted by the
Conservancy. In addition to fuel removal, Conservancy forestry crews assist with prescribed fire projects and
burning after hand piling. Fuel reduction in portions of the study area not under the management jurisdiction of
the Conservancy is the responsibility of local entities. These management practices would continue under any of
the action alternatives (1–4) and under Alternative 5 (No-Project/No-Action Alternative). The Conservancy would
also prepare and implement a fire prevention and management plan in coordination with the appropriate local fire
suppression agencies before the start of construction activities, as described in EC 9. Therefore, the
Conservancy’s management of the study area would remain consistent with statewide laws aimed at reducing
wildfire hazards in wildland-urban interface areas.

5.3

CONSULTATION AND COORDINATION

Consultation and coordination for the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project involved public and

SCOPING

Scoping is an initial and critically important component of the environmental review process. It is intended to
assist in identifying the final range of actions, alternatives, environmental resources, environmental issues, and
mitigation measures that will be analyzed in an environmental document. The scoping process is used to help
ensure that potential environmental problems are identified early and are properly studied.
Scoping is conducted as part of compliance with NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA ordinances. It can be conducted in
various forms and may involve numerous participants, but it generally involves the solicitation of input from the
public and interested agencies to determine the scope, focus, and contents of an environmental document.

NEPA REQUIREMENTS
NEPA requires a formal scoping process during preparation of an EIS. Under NEPA, scoping is the process by
which a lead agency for EIS preparation solicits input on the nature and extent of issues and impacts to be
addressed in the EIS and the methods by which they will be evaluated. NEPA specifically requires that the lead
agency consult with federal agencies with jurisdiction by law over the proposed action and/or alternatives or
agencies with special expertise regarding the action and to solicit information from the public during EIS
preparation.
Section 1501.7 of the Council on Environmental Quality’s NEPA regulations requires the lead agency’s scoping
process to:
►

invite affected federal, state, and local agencies, Indian tribes, project proponents, and other interested persons
to participate in the EIS process;

►

determine the potential significant environmental issues to be analyzed in depth in the EIS;

►

identify and eliminate issues determined to be insignificant or addressed in other documents;

►

allocate assignments among the lead agency and any cooperating agencies regarding preparation of the EIS,
including impact analysis and identification of mitigation measures;

►

identify related environmental documents being prepared;

►

identify other environmental review and consultation requirements; and

►

indicate when the environmental document will be prepared and the lead agency’s tentative planning and
decision-making schedule.

Scoping should occur as early as possible after the lead agency decides to prepare an EIS. The NEPA lead agency
is required to publish a notice of intent (NOI) in the Federal Register that announces its intent to prepare an EIS.
Although not specifically required by NEPA, the lead agency may also hold scoping meetings. Scoping must
occur after the NOI is issued but may occur earlier, as long as appropriate public notice is provided and enough
project information is available to allow the public and relevant agencies to participate effectively.
Reclamation published the NOI for the proposed project in the Federal Register on October 19, 2006. The NOI
provides a summary of the proposed project and project background; describes the proposed alternatives; presents
information on the scoping meetings; and identifies Conservancy, Reclamation, and TRPA contacts. Information
about how to obtain copies of the NOI was made available to scoping meeting attendees, and an electronic version
of the document was posted on the project Web site (see below). The NOI is included in Appendix A.

CEQA REQUIREMENTS
Scoping is a less formalized process under CEQA than under NEPA but is encouraged in the statute and State
CEQA Guidelines. Scoping is recognized as a means to help identify the range of actions, alternatives,
environmental effects, methods of assessment, and mitigation measures to be analyzed in depth in an EIR, and it
is used to eliminate from detailed study those issues that would not be affected by the project. Scoping is also an
effective way to bring together and resolve the concerns of interested Federal, State, and local agencies; the
proponent of the action; and other interested persons, including project opponents.
Tools used to determine the scope of an EIR include early public and interagency consultation, the notice of
preparation (NOP) of an EIR, and scoping meetings with agencies and the public. Of these tools, only the NOP is
a mandatory requirement under CEQA for the preparation of an EIR. Issuance of the NOP, similar to the issuance
of the NOI under NEPA, serves as the trigger for soliciting comments on the proposed project. Scoping typically
ends at the conclusion of a specified public comment period, which is 30 days for the CEQA process, although
public involvement continues throughout the project review and approval effort. The NOP for the project is
discussed below.
Under Section 21083.9 of the statute, a scoping meeting is required if a project qualifies as being of statewide,
regional, or areawide significance. The Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project qualifies for this
requirement. Notice of the scoping meeting is required to include specified recipients, including responsible
agencies, trustee agencies, and members of the public who have requested notification. The scoping meetings held
for the proposed project complied with these CEQA requirements.
The NOP provides notice of the scoping meetings, presents an overview of the proposed project and alternatives,
presents a statement of the purpose of and need for and objectives of the project, summarizes the proposed
alternatives, lists the issues anticipated to be addressed in this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS, and provides contact
information. The Conservancy and TRPA filed the NOP for the proposed project with the California and Nevada
State Clearinghouses and released it publicly on October 4, 2006. The NOP identified November 2, 2006, as the
closing date for submitting scoping comments. In addition to State Clearinghouse distribution to potentially
interested state agencies in both California and Nevada, copies of the NOP were mailed to property owners
(within 300 feet of the study area boundaries) and other parties known to have an interest in the proposed project.
After concern was expressed that the circulation of the NOP in October did not meet all the requirements of
CEQA, the NOP was filed with the California and Nevada State Clearinghouses again on March 16, 2007.
Accompanying the NOP was a public notice announcing the extension of the comment period for the project to
April 30, 2007. In addition to being filed with the State Clearinghouses, this notice and the NOP were also mailed
to homeowners within a 700-foot radius of the study area, as well as to other parties known to have an interest in
the project. This second mailing pertained only to the scoping period pursuant to CEQA and did not affect the
scoping period for the project conducted by Reclamation for compliance with NEPA or by TRPA pursuant to its
Code of Ordinances and Rules of Procedure. The NOP is included in Appendix A.

TRPA REQUIREMENTS
TRPA is required to consult with and obtain the comments of any federal, state, and local agency that has
jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to environmental impacts associated with the project.
Although TRPA rules and ordinances do not require the release of an NOP or mandate conducting formal public
scoping meetings, TRPA typically releases an NOP early in the environmental review process and holds scoping
meetings before the Advisory Planning Commission (APC) and Governing Board (GB) to provide opportunity for
APC and GB members, agencies, and members of the public to provide input on the project. TRPA requirements
were met with release of the NOI and NOP, discussed above.

AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS CONSULTED

This section discusses agency consultation and coordination that occurred during the development of this
DEIR/DEIS/DEIS and summarizes the agency involvement activities undertaken by Reclamation, the
Conservancy, and TRPA to satisfy NEPA, CEQA, and TRPA requirements.

NEPA CONSULTATION
Reclamation invited eligible governmental entities to participate as cooperating agencies, in accordance with 40
CFR Part 46.225(3)(b), in developing the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project EIR/EIS/EIS. Two
agencies requested identification as cooperating agencies under NEPA: USACE and EPA. Reclamation responded
to their requests for cooperating agency status in accordance with 43 CFR Part 46 and the U.S. Department of the
Interior’s Final Rule for implementation of NEPA. Other interested Federal agencies included USFWS, the U.S.
Forest Service, and the U.S. Department of Transportation.

CEQA AND TRPA CONSULTATION
The Conservancy and TRPA contacted responsible agencies, as required under CEQA and TRPA regulations.
Comments from responsible agencies were received from the Lahontan RWQCB and CDFG (a responsible and
trustee agency). Other interested agencies that provided comments were CSLC, ARB, Caltrans, the SHPO, the
Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California, the South Tahoe Public Utilities District, and the Tahoe Resource
Conservation District.

5.3.3

PUBLIC OUTREACH EFFORTS FOR THE UPPER TRUCKEE RIVER AND MARSH
RESTORATION PROJECT

Several outreach efforts have been undertaken to inform stakeholders about the Upper Truckee River and Marsh
Restoration Project, including public meetings during early study phases and development of the project
alternatives, as well as the scoping process.

SCOPING MEETINGS
As described above, scoping meetings are required for the environmental review process. Two public scoping
meetings were held, in the afternoon and evening of October 24, 2006, to provide opportunities for interested
parties to learn about the proposed project and alternatives and to provide input regarding the alternatives and
scope of the environmental document. The project was also presented as an information item to TRPA’s APC and
GB during October 11 and October 25, 2006 meetings. The public, in addition to APC and GB members, was
asked to provide input on the project at these two meetings.
During the October 24, 2006, public scoping meetings, comment cards1 were made available to participants, and
maps describing the alternatives were displayed and discussed. Each meeting included a presentation that
described the project background and objectives, the proposed alternatives, the environmental review process and
tentative schedule, the project website, and public participation opportunities. Meeting locations, dates, and times
were as follows:

1

Comment cards were used to submit written comments at the meetings. They were also preaddressed for submittal via U.S. mail.

SCOPING COMMENTS
Written comments were received, and comments were presented orally, at the scoping meetings. Comments were
received from several state agencies, local agencies, organizations, and numerous members of the public. A
scoping summary report (Conservancy, Reclamation, and TRPA 2007) was prepared for the proposed project.
The report summarizes the results of the scoping process and is available in Appendix B. The comments received
assisted Reclamation, the Conservancy, and TRPA in identifying the final range of actions, alternatives, and
environmental issues that are analyzed in this DEIR/DEIS/DEIS.

OTHER MEETINGS
Although it was not a formal scoping meeting, the Conservancy, at the request of neighbors living in the Cove
East/Al Tahoe area, held a meeting on the evening of April 24, 2007, to discuss the project with concerned
citizens. Approximately 25 interested persons, most of them residents of the Cove East/Al Tahoe area, attended
the discussion. During the meeting, attendees were given a short overview of the project, which was followed by a
question-and-answer period. Because this meeting was not a formal scoping meeting, verbal comments expressed
during the meeting were not recorded as scoping comments. Attendees to the meeting were aware that this was
the case and were provided with information regarding the timeline for submitting comments and means by which
they could submit comments for the record. Maps describing the alternatives were on display during the meeting.

UPPER TRUCKEE UPDATE
The Conservancy has distributed three issues of a newsletter about the project called The Upper Truckee Update.
The project newsletters have included information about the project’s history and background, project objectives,
and proposed alternatives and presented an overview of the alternatives development process. The newsletter also
described the environmental review process, solicited public input, and noticed the two public scoping meetings
that were held in the afternoon and evening of October 24, 2006.
The first and second editions of the newsletter were mailed to property owners near the study area, agencies,
organizations, and the general public in October 2002 and October 2006. The second edition was also made
available at the public scoping meetings, the Conservancy office’s front desk, and Upper Truckee Marsh public
access points. The third edition has been made available at the Conservancy’s front desk and Upper Truckee
Marsh public access points. All newsletters were available on the project web site (see below) and are included in
Appendix B.

NEWSPAPER
The Conservancy placed a newspaper display advertisement in the Tahoe Daily Tribune, the primary newspaper
in the area of the restoration project, on October 20, 2006. The advertisement announced the lead agencies’
intention to prepare an EIR/EIS/EIS, the places and times of the scoping meetings and the TRPA General Board
meeting, Conservancy and TRPA contact information, and the availability of information on the Upper Truckee
River and Marsh Restoration Project website.

WEB SITE
Until 2009, the Conservancy maintained a project website for the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration
Project (http://www.uppertruckeemarsh.com) that presented the project history and background, information
about the study area, project objectives, alternatives descriptions, project schedule, and contact information. It
also included an electronic form for submitting comments on the NOP and an electronic form for requesting being
added to the project’s mailing list. Scoping meeting information was posted on the website on October 4, 2006,
the day on which the NOP was first published.
Since 2009, information regarding the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project, and other
Conservancy projects, has been available at the Conservancy’s website (http://tahoe.ca.gov/upper-truckee-marsh67.aspx).

Project Title:

Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project

Project Location:

The Upper Truckee River drains the largest watershed in the Lake Tahoe Basin. The
Upper Truckee Marsh is located on the south shore of Lake Tahoe where the river enters
the lake. The study area for the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project is
generally bounded by U.S. Highway 50 (U.S. 50) and the Highland Woods neighborhood
on the south, the Al Tahoe neighborhood on the east, and Tahoe Islands/Sky Meadows

and Tahoe Keys neighborhoods on the west (Exhibit 1). The study area is approximately
592 acres, and includes parcels owned by the California Tahoe Conservancy
(Conservancy), other public agencies, and private landowners (Exhibit 2). It includes the
downstream reaches of Trout Creek and the Upper Truckee River, adjacent wetland and
uplands habitats, and the Lower West Side (LWS) Wetlands Restoration Project site
(located in the northwest portion of the study area, just east of the Tahoe Keys Marina).
The Conservancy, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), and the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency
(TRPA) are preparing a joint EIR/EIS/EIS for the Upper Truckee Marsh Restoration Project (project). This joint
document will serve as an EIR prepared by the Conservancy pursuant to the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA); an EIS prepared by Reclamation pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and
the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations Implementing NEPA; and an EIS prepared by TRPA
pursuant to its Compact and Chapter 5 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances. This notice meets the CEQA and TRPA
noticing requirements for a Notice of Preparation (NOP). Reclamation has prepared a separate notice that meets
NEPA requirements for a Notice of Intent (NOI) for publication in the Federal Register.
We would like to know the views of interested persons, organizations, and agencies as to the scope and content of
the information to be included and analyzed in the EIR/EIS/EIS. Agencies should comment on the elements of the
environmental information that are relevant to their statutory responsibilities in connection with the proposed

SUMMARY
The Conservancy, Reclamation, and TRPA are pursuing a restoration project along the reach of the Upper
Truckee River that extends from U.S. 50 north to Lake Tahoe, including the adjacent meadow and wetland. The
primary purpose of the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project is to restore natural geomorphic

processes and ecological functions along this reach of river. The Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration
Project is identified in TRPA’s Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) as a project that is necessary to
restore and maintain environmental thresholds for the Lake Tahoe Basin. EIP projects are designed to achieve and
maintain environmental thresholds that protect Tahoe’s unique and valued resources.
An extensive evaluation and restoration planning process has been conducted to identify potentially feasible
approaches for restoration of the river and marsh. As a result of that process, the following five alternatives,
including four action alternatives and a No Project/No Action Alternative, are intended to be evaluated in the
EIR/EIS/EIS.
►

Alternative 1. Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)

►

Alternative 2. New Channel – West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure)

►

Alternative 3. Middle Marsh Corridor (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)

►

Alternative 4. Inset Floodplain (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)

►

Alternative 5. No Project/No Action

These alternatives are named for their approach to restoration of the Upper Truckee River, and the associated
level of recreation infrastructure, and are described in more detail below.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
BACKGROUND
The Upper Truckee River has been substantially altered by land practices during the past 150 years. Throughout
its watershed, the river has experienced ecosystem degradation typical of what has occurred elsewhere in the
Basin. The river has been modified from its original conditions by human activities, such as logging; livestock
grazing; roads; golf courses; an airport; and residential, commercial and industrial developments. These
conditions have resulted in increased sediment and nutrient loads discharging into Lake Tahoe from the river,
which contribute to the declining clarity of the lake. Human influences have also resulted in reduced habitat
quality for plant, wildlife, and fish species in the watershed. Restoration of natural processes and ecological
functions of the river is an important part of the response to the decline in lake clarity.
Restoration planning for the marsh began in the early 1990’s with studies conducted by the University of
California. In 1995, the Conservancy commissioned a restoration planning and design study, which identified a
tentatively preferred river restoration concept two years later. However, it was determined that river restoration
required use of the entire Upper Truckee Marsh, and at that time the east side of the marsh was not owned by the
Conservancy; therefore, this tentatively selected concept could not be pursued. In 1998, the Conservancy began
planning and design of an initial phase of wetland restoration on a 23-acre portion of a study area located on the
Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project

east side of the Upper Truckee River near Lake Tahoe (Exhibit 2). This is an area, called the Lower West Side
Wetland Restoration Project (LWS), where the marsh had been previously filled during the construction of the
adjacent Tahoe Keys. After careful investigations, planning, and design; extensive environmental review; and
community outreach, the Conservancy approved restoration of 12 acres of wetland through fill removal as the
LWS Project in 2001. Construction commenced in the summer of 2001 and was completed in the summer of
2003.
In 2000, the Conservancy purchased 311 acres of land in the center of the marsh from a private party, bringing
nearly the entire Truckee Marsh into public ownership. Currently, the majority of the study area is owned by the
Conservancy, including the marsh and meadows surrounding the lower reach of Trout Creek. Restoration
concepts encompassing the whole marsh and the lower reach of the river could be developed after the acquisition.
As part of this process, the Conservancy has also conducted public access and recreation use management
planning for the river, marsh, and beach.
Initially, the Conservancy defined project objectives and desired outcomes to direct the restoration planning
process. A comprehensive evaluation and documentation of the existing natural processes and functions in the
study area were conducted to begin the alternatives planning process. This evaluation enabled the identification of
potential restoration opportunities and constraints. Armed with detailed information about the river and marsh
processes and ecological functions, the Conservancy hosted a design charrette (i.e., interactive workshop) for
agencies and other stakeholders to identify the spectrum of potentially feasible restoration ideas to be considered
in the development of concept plan alternatives. Four alternative concept plans, all developed to be potentially
feasible, were formulated to represent a reasonable range of restoration approaches. The four concepts generated
by this extensive process became the four action alternatives being evaluated in the EIR/EIS/EIS. A preferred
alternative will be identified after public review of the four alternatives and public comments are received on the
Draft EIR/EIS/EIS.
To date, key stages of the Upper Truckee Marsh Restoration project have included the following:
►

Evaluating existing natural processes and functions of the Upper Truckee River and marsh in 2000 and 2001

►

Establishing project objectives and desired outcomes in 2002, and updating them in 2005.

►

Defining restoration opportunities and constraints in 2002 and 2003

►

Conducting a restoration design charette in 2003 to receive input from stakeholders on project priorities,
concerns and constraints, and design ideas.

►

Conducting hydraulic modeling studies to support the development and evaluation of project alternatives.

Initial development and comparative evaluation of four conceptual restoration alternatives in 2004 and 2005.

►

Regulatory agency review of alternative concepts for key issues and regulatory requirements in 2005.

Further refinement and evaluation of the alternatives, and preparation of a Concept Plan Report (July 2006).

PURPOSE AND NEED
The need for the project originates from the environmental degradation that the Upper Truckee River has
historically experienced as a result of human alterations to the river and watershed. The purpose of the proposed
action is to restore natural geomorphic processes and ecological functions in this lowest reach of the Upper
Truckee River and the surrounding marsh to improve ecological values of the study area and help reduce the
river’s discharge of nutrients and sediment that diminish Lake Tahoe’s clarity.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The following basic objectives of the project were developed for the proposed action to meet the purpose and
need:
Objective 1.

Restore natural and self-sustaining river and floodplain processes and functions

Objective 2.

Protect, enhance, and restore naturally functioning habitats

Objective 3.

Restore and enhance fish and wildlife habitat quality

Objective 4.

Improve water quality through enhancement of natural physical and biological processes

Objective 5.

Protect and, where feasible, expand Tahoe yellow cress populations

Objective 6.

Provide public access, access to vistas, and environmental education at the Lower West Side and
Cove East Beach

Objective 7.

Avoid increasing flood hazard on adjacent private property

Objective 8.

Design with sensitivity to the site’s history and cultural heritage

Objective 9.

Design the wetland/urban interface to help provide habitat value and water quality benefits

Objective 10.

Implement a public health and safety program, including mosquito monitoring and control

SUMMARY OF ALTERNATIVES
Four “action” alternatives, and the No Project/No Action Alternative, will be evaluated at an equal level of detail in
the EIR/EIS/EIS. The four action alternatives are illustrated in Exhibits 3 through 6 and are described below. It is
important to note that many of the individual components in each alternative are modular and could be transferred to
other alternatives, or recombined after environmental review to formulate different variations of the alternatives.

All four action alternatives include a recreation and public access component. These ideas are expressed at three
levels of development intensity with respect to recreation-related infrastructure (“maximum”, “minimum”, and
“moderate”). At this point in project planning, there is no necessary connection between the recreation and public
access approach included in a particular alternative and the river restoration strategy of that alternative. The level
of public access and recreational facilities included in the alternative selected for implementation would need to
be compatible with that alternative’s river and marsh restoration strategy.

ALTERNATIVE 1. CHANNEL AGGRADATION AND NARROWING (MAXIMUM RECREATION
INFRASTRUCTURE)
Key elements specific to Alternative 1 include:
►

Raising the bed elevation of the existing channel closer to the existing meadow surface as a means of reestablishing an active floodplain, which would be achieved by placing a series of structures in the channel
designed to alter hydraulics and intentionally cause sediment aggradation of the bed. Local cut and fill would
be used to narrow the channel. Bar development in the aggrading channel would also contribute to channel
narrowing.

►

Creating a sinuous, single thread bankfull channel excavated through the LWS.

►

Using the existing river mouth location, but reducing its capacity by narrowing it with local cut and fill and/or
placement of bioengineered structures to encourage sediment deposition.

►

Reconfiguring two sections of split channel from River Station (RS) 500 to RS 2,600. The low flow channel
would continue to flow through the east branch of the split channel from RS 500 to RS 1,400, but unlike
existing conditions, would continue in the second east branch channel from RS 1,400 to RS 2,600. The west
branches of the split channels would reduce the flow volume and hydraulic stress in the east low-flow channel
by conveying a portion of the high flow.

►

Constructing a bulkhead at the sailing lagoon to cutoff its open connection with the marina and Lake Tahoe
and reconfiguring the relationship between the sailing lagoon and the Upper Truckee River so that the river
controls the hydrology of the lagoon. The new lagoonal system would be analogous to what currently exists
along Trout Creek, but on a larger scale and similar to the Upper Truckee lagoon system prior to the
construction of the Tahoe Keys development. The lagoon would be constructed just west of the Upper
Truckee River. At flow events greater than bankfull, water would overtop the river’s banks and begin to flow
into the lagoon. Local cut and fill would be used to re-contour the topography of the lagoon and decrease its
depth.

►

Constructing a full-service visitor and interpretive center on a Conservancy-owned parcel on high capability
land near the end of Venice Drive and a small self-service visitor and interpretive center along the existing
bike trail near Trout Creek Bridge. The full-service facility would be fully staffed and would likely require a
concessionaire to support its maintenance costs. It could have office space included, for instance, for the
Conservancy or an appropriate non-profit entity to rent. The full-service facility would contain public
restrooms. A new parking lot would be located adjacent to the full-service visitor and interpretive center near
the end of Venice Drive.

►

Developing an interpretive program and installing additional interpretive signage in appropriate locations
throughout the site.

►

Reconfiguring the channel dimensions and raising the streambed due to prompted channel aggradation from
the hydraulic structures, which would decrease channel capacity.

►

Re-routing the trail providing public access to Cove East Beach west of the sailing lagoon on a new levee
parallel to the marina channel. This would allow integration of the sailing lagoon into an Upper Truckee
River-lagoon complex.

►

Enhancing the existing trail alignment providing access to Cove East Beach by constructing a spur trail and
boardwalk to an observation platform near the river mouth. The platform would provide a view across the
river mouth and the meadow and lagoon to the east, as well as out across the lake. The boardwalk railings and
its height above the ground would help keep people off the sandy areas during periods of low lake level.

►

Constructing new trails and boardwalks along the eastern perimeter of the site to help direct and control
existing pedestrian access to Barton Meadow, and in particular to the interior of the site. Wet swales and low
mounds would be used to discourage visitor access to the sensitive areas in the center of the marsh. The
function of boardwalks would be to raise people out of the wetter portions of the site where they currently
walk and damage wetland vegetation.

►

Providing a raised boardwalk connection to the beach. An observation platform would be constructed at the
end of the boardwalk to provide an overlook of the lake, beach, and the wetland, while discouraging entry
onto the beach itself.

►

Providing a raised boardwalk for both pedestrians and cyclists that would cross Trout Creek in the southern
portion of the site, and link to existing bicycle trails at both ends. The boardwalk would allow visitors visual
access into the meadow and to the lake beyond, while minimizing the disturbance that large numbers of hikers
can have on meadow plants.

►

Constructing a Class I bike trail along Venice Drive.

►

Constructing a loop trail for both pedestrian and bicyclists through the wooded area north of Highland
Woods.

►

Constructing a river corridor barrier near the current river alignment to reduce wildlife disturbance.

►

Removing fill behind Harootunian Beach to recreate lagoon and wet meadow conditions.

►

Restoring sand ridges (“dunes”) at Cove East.

ALTERNATIVE 2. NEW CHANNEL – WEST MEADOW (MINIMUM RECREATION INFRASTRUCTURE)
Key elements specific to Alternative 2 include:
►

Excavating a new geomorphic bankfull capacity channel that re-establishes the existing meadow as an active
floodplain. Most of the new channel alignment would be located east of the existing channel. A hydraulic
structure would be constructed in the channel to facilitate the flow transition from the relatively low bed
elevation of the existing incised channel to the higher bed elevation of the new channel.

►

Creating a sinuous, single thread bankfull channel excavated east of the LWS and straightened reach that has
a sinuous planform, bankfull capacity, and active floodplain connection with the existing meadow surface.

►

Constructing a new river mouth with a reduced capacity and higher bed elevation west of the existing
location. This would provide the opportunity for a small area of beach restoration in the existing channel
location. Since this area is prime Tahoe yellow cress habitat, it is anticipated that Tahoe yellow cress would
expand in this beach restoration area.

►

Maintaining a low-flow channel in the same alignment, and providing hydraulic stress relief by excavating
portions of the meadow/terrace separating the split channel branches to create areas for high flow release.

Constructing a bulkhead at the sailing lagoon to cutoff its open connection with the marina and Lake Tahoe
and reconfiguring the relationship between the sailing lagoon and the Upper Truckee River so that the river

along Trout Creek, but on a larger scale and similar to the Upper Truckee River lagoon system prior to the
construction of the Tahoe Keys development. The new lagoon would be constructed just west of the Upper
Truckee River. At flow events greater than bankfull, water would overtop the river’s banks and begin to flow
into the lagoon. There would be no change to the dredged depth of the lagoon.

►

Developing an interpretive program and installing additional interpretive signage in appropriate locations
throughout the site. No new buildings, public restroom facilities, or additional buildings would be
constructed.

►

Reconfiguring the channel dimensions and raising the streambed by encouraging aggradation behind the
hydraulic structures would restore channel capacity.

►

Re-routing the trail providing public access to Cove East Beach to west of the sailing lagoon on a new levee
parallel to the marina channel. This would allow integration of the sailing lagoon into an Upper Truckee
River-lagoon complex.

►

Constructing view points (on-grade or elevated as observation platforms) on the eastern margin of the site at
the end of each of several streets where people currently access the site. The design intent of the view points
would be to discourage pedestrians and their pets from entering the site.

►

Maintaining the location of existing bicycle trails around the perimeter of the study area.

►

Constructing a river corridor barrier near the current river alignment to reduce wildlife disturbance.

►

Removing fill behind Harootunian Beach to recreate lagoon and wet meadow conditions.

►

Restoring sand ridges (“dunes”) at Cove East.

ALTERNATIVE 3. MIDDLE MARSH CORRIDOR (MODERATE RECREATION INFRASTRUCTURE)
Key elements specific to Alternative 3 include:
►

Creating a new geomorphic bankfull capacity pilot channel to connect the river with the existing network of
small channels in the middle of the marsh and re-establish an active floodplain on the existing meadow
surface. A hydraulic structure would be constructed in the existing channel to facilitate the flow transition
from the relatively low bed elevation of the existing incised channel to the higher bed elevation of the pilot

channel and existing meadow channels. No construction would occur within the main meadow’s channel
sections; the river flow paths would be dictated by natural processes.
►

Using the existing river mouth location, but reducing its capacity by narrowing with local cut and fill and
constructing a higher bed elevation with engineered grade controls that simulate the resistant horizontal layers
in the subsurface.

►

In the reach between U.S. 50 and the “Big Bend,” maintaining the low-flow channel in the same alignment,
and provide hydraulic stress relief by excavating portions of the meadow/terrace separating the split channel
branches to create areas for high flow release. Options for additional high flow conveyance under U.S. 50
could include bored overflow conduits.

►

Constructing a bulkhead at the sailing lagoon to cutoff its open connection with the marina and Lake Tahoe
and reconfiguring the relationship between the sailing lagoon and the Upper Truckee River so that the river
controls the hydrology of the lagoon. The new lagoonal system would be analogous to what currently exists
along Trout Creek, but on a larger scale and similar to the Upper Truckee lagoon system prior to the
construction of the Tahoe Keys development. Limited re-contouring would be used to adjust the contours and
edges of the lagoon.

►

Constructing a small self-service visitor and interpretive center just north of the cul-de-sac at the LWS. Public
restrooms would be included as part of the visitor’s center. A new parking lot would be located on a
Conservancy-owned parcel near the end of Venice Drive.

►

Developing an interpretive program and installing additional interpretive signage in appropriate locations
throughout the site.

►

Reconfiguring the channel dimensions and raising the streambed by encouraging aggradation behind the
hydraulic structures would restore channel capacity.

►

Re-routing the trail providing public access to Cove East Beach to west of the sailing lagoon on a new levee
parallel to the marina channel. This would allow integration of the sailing lagoon into an Upper Truckee
River-lagoon complex.

►

Constructing trails and boardwalks along the eastern perimeter of the site to help direct and control the
existing pedestrian access to Barton Meadow, and in particular to the interior of the site. Wet swales and low
mounds would also be used to discourage visitor access to the sensitive areas in the center of the marsh. The
function of boardwalks would be to raise people out of the wetter portions of the site where they currently
walk and damage wetland vegetation.

provided north across the wetland to the beach.

►

Maintaining existing bicycle trails around the perimeter of the study area.

►

Constructing a loop trail for both pedestrians and cyclists through the wooded area north of Highland Woods.

ALTERNATIVE 4. INSET FLOODPLAIN (MODERATE RECREATION INFRASTRUCTURE)
Alternative 4 is fundamentally different from Alternatives 1 through 3 in that the existing streambed elevation
would not be raised and no new channels would be excavated into the existing meadow/terrace surface. Key
elements specific to Alternative 4 include:
►

Excavating portions of the meadow surface along the corridor of the existing channel to create an inset
floodplain that would increase active floodplain area and flood storage for small magnitude events.

►

Using local cut and fill to reduce the width and capacity of the existing channel.

►

Creating a sinuous, single thread bankfull channel constructed along a similar alignment as the straightened
reach using local cut and fill.

►

Using the existing river mouth location, but reducing its capacity by narrowing it with local cut and fill.

►

Maintaining the low-flow channel in the same alignment, and providing hydraulic stress relief by excavating
portions of the meadow/terrace separating the split channel branches to create areas for high flow release.

►

Retaining the open connection between the sailing lagoon, the marina, and Lake Tahoe.

►

Constructing a small self-service visitor and interpretive center just north of the cul-de-sac at the LWS. Public
restrooms would be included as part of the visitor’s center. A new parking lot would be located on a
Conservancy-owned parcel near the end of Venice Drive.

►

Developing an interpretive program and installing additional interpretive signage in appropriate locations
throughout the site.

►

Constructing trails and boardwalks along the eastern perimeter of the site to help direct and control existing
pedestrian access to Barton Meadow, and in particular to the interior of the site. Wet swales and low mounds
would also be used to discourage visitor access to the sensitive areas in the center of the marsh. The function
of boardwalks would be to raise people out of the wetter portions of the site where they currently walk and
damage wetland vegetation.

ALTERNATIVE 5. NO PROJECT/NO ACTION
Under Alternative 5, no changes to the river or marsh would be implemented and existing conditions in the study
area would be projected into the future.

POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS
The following subject areas include potential environmental effects associated with the range of alternatives
identified above. These issues will be explored further during project scoping and during preparation of the draft
EIR/EIS:
Land Use. Land use impacts to be addressed in the EIR/EIS/EIS include changes to onsite uses, land use
compatibility, and community character. The EIR/EIS/EIS will also address consistency with the TRPA plan area
statement (PAS) requirements (PAS 100 and 102).
Hydrology, Geomorphology, and Water Quality. Alternatives 1-4 would restore a portion of the Upper Truckee
River with the intent to improve long-term water quality in the river and Lake Tahoe by reducing the reach’s
contribution of nutrients and suspended sediment to the river. Implementation of Alternatives 1-4 could create a
risk that short-term increases in sediment load during the construction period. Best Management Practices and
mitigation measures would be developed to address potential short-term impacts to water quality that are
identified in the EIR/EIS/EIS. Restoration of the river channel would change the hydrologic and geomorphic
processes of the river. The hydrologic analysis will focus primarily on assessing changes to flow patterns as
related to changes in channel form and function, support of restoration objectives, and avoidance of any increase
in flood hazard to developed land uses adjacent to the river. The geomorphic assessment will focus on potential
short- and long-term changes in sediment fate and transport and landscape-scale factors. The EIR/EIS/EIS will
also address long-term water quality monitoring needs.
Biological Resources (Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Vegetation and Wildlife). Alternatives 1-4 include
actions for enhancing or restoring native vegetation communities, protecting sensitive wildlife habitat areas from

October 2006

excessive public use, and enhancing terrestrial and aquatic habitat values. These actions would affect the
distribution, extent, and quality of sensitive and common biological resources on the project site. Each alternative
was designed to result in long-term benefits to biological resources; however, construction of Alternatives 1-4
would remove or disturb terrestrial and aquatic habitats in some locations. Each alternative would result in
changes in existing public access to and recreational uses of the project site, which would influence future patterns
of disturbance on biological resources. The EIR/EIS/EIS will evaluate the potential indirect, direct, and
cumulative effects of each alternative on: 1) existing vegetation communities, wildlife habitats, and aquatic
resources; 2) common and ecologically significant vegetation, wildlife, and aquatic resources; and 3) specialstatus plant, wildlife, and aquatic species, including TRPA Special Interest Species. The relationship of project
effects to TRPA thresholds for vegetation, wildlife, and fisheries will be evaluated.
Earth Resources: Geology and Soils, and Land Capability and Coverage. Alternatives 1-4 would involve
grading and excavating for reconfiguration of a portion of the Upper Truckee River and changing site topography
for restoration purposes, including filling portions of the existing, degraded channel. The EIR/EIS/EIS will
describe potential environmental effects related to land capability and coverage, soils and geology, topographic
alteration, seismic hazards, slope stability, and erosion potential. If soil export outside of the study area is
necessary, potential disposal sites will be identified and evaluated.
Scenic Resources. Alternatives 1-4 would result in the changes to natural elements that contribute to the scenic
quality of the study area (e.g., river channel, river mouth, lagoon, vegetation), as well as changes related to the
installation of recreation-related structures (e.g., trails, boardwalks, viewing points, visitor center). Visibility of
these changes from the appropriate shoreline travel route on the lake and from U.S. 50, a TRPA-designated scenic
travel route, will be determined. Potential impacts from construction and operation of the alternatives will be
evaluated from sensitive viewpoints in or near the study area. Scenic effects will be evaluated in terms of
visibility of the alternatives, alteration of the visual setting, sensitivity of viewpoints, and potential effects on
TRPA scenic thresholds.
Public Access and Recreation. Construction and operation of Alternatives 1-4 would result in changes in existing
public access to and recreational uses of the study area. The study area is surrounded by residential neighborhoods
of South Lake Tahoe. PAS 102 on west side of the study area includes a priority for public access to the lake at
Cove East Beach. PAS 100, which occupies the center and east side of the study area, emphasizes resources
conservation. The location of a boat take-out site on the river differs among the alternatives, so impacts to
paddling use of the river will be evaluated. The EIR/EIS/EIS will evaluate the changes to existing recreation areas
and uses, the change to TRPA persons-at-one-time (PAOTs) allocations in the project area, the effect on TRPA
recreation thresholds, trail connectivity, and river access and crossings.

Cultural Resources. The study area is located on undeveloped land. The EIR/EIS/EIS will analyze the potential
for cultural resources to be located on or near the site and the potential for disturbance of known and/or
undiscovered cultural resources due to implementation of the proposed alternatives. Also, the proposed action
includes consideration of Native American cultural uses of the study area and how restoration can be compatible
with and support those uses. The EIR/EIS/EIS process will include consultation with the Washoe Tribe and
evaluation in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.
Transportation, Parking and Circulation. Alternatives 1-4 would generate short-term, construction-related
traffic. Long-term traffic generated by the recreational components will also be discussed. The transportation
analysis will include identification of major roadways that may be affected by the proposed alternatives, traffic
volumes on those roadways, overall operating conditions, public transit routes that may be affected by the
proposed alternatives, and major pedestrian or bicycle routes that may be affected by the proposed alternatives.
Air Quality. Alternatives 1-4 would involve construction emissions and generation of fugitive dust, as well as
generate construction traffic in the area, contributing pollutants to the air basin. The EIR/EIS/EIS will include an
assessment of short-term (i.e., construction) air quality impacts and long-term (i.e., operational) regional air
pollutant emissions, including mobile, stationary, and area source emissions.
Noise. The EIR/EIS/EIS will assess potential short-term (i.e., construction) noise impacts, relative to sensitive
receptors and their potential exposure. Noise levels of specific construction equipment will be determined and
resultant noise levels at nearby receptors (at given distances from the source) will be calculated. Long-term (i.e.,
operational) noise impacts, including increased noise from mobile, stationary, and area sources, will be assessed.
Public Services and Utilities. The public services and utilities section of the EIR/EIS/EIS will evaluate impacts
on power, water treatment and distribution, wastewater collection, solid waste collection and disposal, police
services, fire protection services, schools, and fire fuel management.
Hazards and Hazardous Materials. The EIR/EIS/EIS will assess whether potential hazardous materials may be
located in the study area. The EIR/EIS/EIS will also address hazardous materials issues related to adjoining
properties.
Agricultural and Mineral Resources. The proposed alternatives are not expected to affect agricultural or mineral
resources in the study area. Existing resources will be verified and discussed in the EIR/EIS/EIS.
Socioeconomics. With the exception of recreation, discussed above, the proposed alternatives are not expected to
significantly affect socioeconomic factors associated with the study area. The EIR/EIS/EIS will consider potential
economic impacts related to implementation of the proposed alternatives.

Growth Inducement. The effects of the proposed alternatives on growth inducement will be addressed in the
EIR/EIS/EIS; however, the proposed alternatives are not expected to induce or result in the growth of population
in the region, cause an increase in demand for employment opportunities, or cause an increase in other public
needs.
Cumulative Effects. The EIR/EIS/EIS will identify and describe recently approved and reasonably anticipated
non-river related projects in the South Lake Tahoe area and vicinity of the Upper Truckee Marsh, other river
restoration projects being contemplated for upstream reaches of the Upper Truckee River, and region-wide
planning efforts currently underway (e.g., Pathway 2007, the total maximum daily load [TMDL] requirement
being developed for the Upper Truckee River). The EIR/EIS/EIS will evaluate the combined effects of these
activities with the proposed action.
TRPA Threshold Carrying Capacities: The EIR/EIS/EIS will include assessment of the proposed action’s
compliance with and contribution to the attainment of threshold carrying capacities adopted by TRPA.

INTENDED USES OF THE EIR/EIS/EIS
The Conservancy, Reclamation, and TRPA will use this EIR/EIS/EIS to consider the environmental effects,
mitigation measures, and alternatives, when reviewing the proposed action for approval. The EIR/EIS/EIS will
serve as the State’s CEQA compliance document, as Reclamation’s NEPA compliance document, and as TRPA’s
compliance document with respect to its Compact and Chapter 5 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances. State
responsible and trustee agencies and federal cooperating agencies may also use this EIR/EIS/EIS, as needed, for
subsequent discretionary actions.

PUBLIC SCOPING
Public scoping meetings are being conducted to provide you with the opportunity to learn more about the
proposed action and to express oral comments about the content of the EIR/EIS/EIS, in addition to your
opportunity to submit written comments. The scoping meetings will be held at the following times and locations:

Project Title:

Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project

Project Location:

The Upper Truckee River drains the largest watershed in the Lake Tahoe Basin. The
Upper Truckee Marsh is located on the south shore of Lake Tahoe where the river enters
the lake. The study area for the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project is
generally bounded by U.S. Highway 50 (U.S. 50) and the Highland Woods neighborhood
on the south, the Al Tahoe neighborhood on the east, and Tahoe Islands/Sky Meadows

and Tahoe Keys neighborhoods on the west (Exhibit 1). The study area is approximately
592 acres, and includes parcels owned by the California Tahoe Conservancy
(Conservancy), other public agencies, and private landowners (Exhibit 2). It includes the
downstream reaches of Trout Creek and the Upper Truckee River, adjacent wetland and
uplands habitats, and the Lower West Side (LWS) Wetlands Restoration Project site
(located in the northwest portion of the study area, just east of the Tahoe Keys Marina).
The Conservancy, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), and the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency
(TRPA) are preparing a joint EIR/EIS/EIS for the Upper Truckee Marsh Restoration Project (project). This joint
document will serve as an EIR prepared by the Conservancy pursuant to the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA); an EIS prepared by Reclamation pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and
the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations Implementing NEPA; and an EIS prepared by TRPA
pursuant to its Compact and Chapter 5 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances. This notice meets the CEQA and TRPA
noticing requirements for a Notice of Preparation (NOP). Reclamation has prepared a separate notice that meets
NEPA requirements for a Notice of Intent (NOI) for publication in the Federal Register.
We would like to know the views of interested persons, organizations, and agencies as to the scope and content of
the information to be included and analyzed in the EIR/EIS/EIS. Agencies should comment on the elements of the
environmental information that are relevant to their statutory responsibilities in connection with the proposed

SUMMARY
The Conservancy, Reclamation, and TRPA are pursuing a restoration project along the reach of the Upper
Truckee River that extends from U.S. 50 north to Lake Tahoe, including the adjacent meadow and wetland. The
primary purpose of the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project is to restore natural geomorphic

processes and ecological functions along this reach of river. The Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration
Project is identified in TRPA’s Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) as a project that is necessary to
restore and maintain environmental thresholds for the Lake Tahoe Basin. EIP projects are designed to achieve and
maintain environmental thresholds that protect Tahoe’s unique and valued resources.
An extensive evaluation and restoration planning process has been conducted to identify potentially feasible
approaches for restoration of the river and marsh. As a result of that process, the following five alternatives,
including four action alternatives and a No Project/No Action Alternative, are intended to be evaluated in the
EIR/EIS/EIS.
►

Alternative 1. Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)

►

Alternative 2. New Channel – West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure)

►

Alternative 3. Middle Marsh Corridor (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)

►

Alternative 4. Inset Floodplain (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)

►

Alternative 5. No Project/No Action

These alternatives are named for their approach to restoration of the Upper Truckee River, and the associated
level of recreation infrastructure, and are described in more detail below.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
BACKGROUND
The Upper Truckee River has been substantially altered by land practices during the past 150 years. Throughout
its watershed, the river has experienced ecosystem degradation typical of what has occurred elsewhere in the
Basin. The river has been modified from its original conditions by human activities, such as logging; livestock
grazing; roads; golf courses; an airport; and residential, commercial and industrial developments. These
conditions have resulted in increased sediment and nutrient loads discharging into Lake Tahoe from the river,
which contribute to the declining clarity of the lake. Human influences have also resulted in reduced habitat
quality for plant, wildlife, and fish species in the watershed. Restoration of natural processes and ecological
functions of the river is an important part of the response to the decline in lake clarity.
Restoration planning for the marsh began in the early 1990’s with studies conducted by the University of
California. In 1995, the Conservancy commissioned a restoration planning and design study, which identified a
tentatively preferred river restoration concept two years later. However, it was determined that river restoration
required use of the entire Upper Truckee Marsh, and at that time the east side of the marsh was not owned by the
Conservancy; therefore, this tentatively selected concept could not be pursued. In 1998, the Conservancy began
planning and design of an initial phase of wetland restoration on a 23-acre portion of a study area located on the
Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project

east side of the Upper Truckee River near Lake Tahoe (Exhibit 2). This is an area, called the Lower West Side
Wetland Restoration Project (LWS), where the marsh had been previously filled during the construction of the
adjacent Tahoe Keys. After careful investigations, planning, and design; extensive environmental review; and
community outreach, the Conservancy approved restoration of 12 acres of wetland through fill removal as the
LWS Project in 2001. Construction commenced in the summer of 2001 and was completed in the summer of
2003.
In 2000, the Conservancy purchased 311 acres of land in the center of the marsh from a private party, bringing
nearly the entire Truckee Marsh into public ownership. Currently, the majority of the study area is owned by the
Conservancy, including the marsh and meadows surrounding the lower reach of Trout Creek. Restoration
concepts encompassing the whole marsh and the lower reach of the river could be developed after the acquisition.
As part of this process, the Conservancy has also conducted public access and recreation use management
planning for the river, marsh, and beach.
Initially, the Conservancy defined project objectives and desired outcomes to direct the restoration planning
process. A comprehensive evaluation and documentation of the existing natural processes and functions in the
study area were conducted to begin the alternatives planning process. This evaluation enabled the identification of
potential restoration opportunities and constraints. Armed with detailed information about the river and marsh
processes and ecological functions, the Conservancy hosted a design charrette (i.e., interactive workshop) for
agencies and other stakeholders to identify the spectrum of potentially feasible restoration ideas to be considered
in the development of concept plan alternatives. Four alternative concept plans, all developed to be potentially
feasible, were formulated to represent a reasonable range of restoration approaches. The four concepts generated
by this extensive process became the four action alternatives being evaluated in the EIR/EIS/EIS. A preferred
alternative will be identified after public review of the four alternatives and public comments are received on the
Draft EIR/EIS/EIS.
To date, key stages of the Upper Truckee Marsh Restoration project have included the following:
►

Evaluating existing natural processes and functions of the Upper Truckee River and marsh in 2000 and 2001

►

Establishing project objectives and desired outcomes in 2002, and updating them in 2005.

►

Defining restoration opportunities and constraints in 2002 and 2003

►

Conducting a restoration design charette in 2003 to receive input from stakeholders on project priorities,
concerns and constraints, and design ideas.

►

Conducting hydraulic modeling studies to support the development and evaluation of project alternatives.

Further refinement and evaluation of the alternatives, and preparation of a Concept Plan Report (July 2006).

PURPOSE AND NEED
The need for the project originates from the environmental degradation that the Upper Truckee River has
historically experienced as a result of human alterations to the river and watershed. The purpose of the proposed
action is to restore natural geomorphic processes and ecological functions in this lowest reach of the Upper
Truckee River and the surrounding marsh to improve ecological values of the study area and help reduce the
river’s discharge of nutrients and sediment that diminish Lake Tahoe’s clarity.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The following basic objectives of the project were developed for the proposed action to meet the purpose and
need:
Objective 1.

Restore natural and self-sustaining river and floodplain processes and functions

Objective 2.

Protect, enhance, and restore naturally functioning habitats

Objective 3.

Restore and enhance fish and wildlife habitat quality

Objective 4.

Improve water quality through enhancement of natural physical and biological processes

Objective 5.

Protect and, where feasible, expand Tahoe yellow cress populations

Objective 6.

Provide public access, access to vistas, and environmental education at the Lower West Side and
Cove East Beach

Objective 7.

Avoid increasing flood hazard on adjacent private property

Objective 8.

Design with sensitivity to the site’s history and cultural heritage

Objective 9.

Design the wetland/urban interface to help provide habitat value and water quality benefits

Objective 10.

Implement a public health and safety program, including mosquito monitoring and control

SUMMARY OF ALTERNATIVES
Four “action” alternatives, and the No Project/No Action Alternative, will be evaluated at an equal level of detail in
the EIR/EIS/EIS. The four action alternatives are illustrated in Exhibits 3 through 6 and are described below. It is
important to note that many of the individual components in each alternative are modular and could be transferred to
other alternatives, or recombined after environmental review to formulate different variations of the alternatives.

All four action alternatives include a recreation and public access component. These ideas are expressed at three
levels of development intensity with respect to recreation-related infrastructure (“maximum”, “minimum”, and
“moderate”). At this point in project planning, there is no necessary connection between the recreation and public
access approach included in a particular alternative and the river restoration strategy of that alternative. The level
of public access and recreational facilities included in the alternative selected for implementation would need to
be compatible with that alternative’s river and marsh restoration strategy.

ALTERNATIVE 1. CHANNEL AGGRADATION AND NARROWING (MAXIMUM RECREATION
INFRASTRUCTURE)
Key elements specific to Alternative 1 include:
►

Raising the bed elevation of the existing channel closer to the existing meadow surface as a means of reestablishing an active floodplain, which would be achieved by placing a series of structures in the channel
designed to alter hydraulics and intentionally cause sediment aggradation of the bed. Local cut and fill would
be used to narrow the channel. Bar development in the aggrading channel would also contribute to channel
narrowing.

►

Creating a sinuous, single thread bankfull channel excavated through the LWS.

►

Using the existing river mouth location, but reducing its capacity by narrowing it with local cut and fill and/or
placement of bioengineered structures to encourage sediment deposition.

►

Reconfiguring two sections of split channel from River Station (RS) 500 to RS 2,600. The low flow channel
would continue to flow through the east branch of the split channel from RS 500 to RS 1,400, but unlike
existing conditions, would continue in the second east branch channel from RS 1,400 to RS 2,600. The west
branches of the split channels would reduce the flow volume and hydraulic stress in the east low-flow channel
by conveying a portion of the high flow.

►

Constructing a bulkhead at the sailing lagoon to cutoff its open connection with the marina and Lake Tahoe
and reconfiguring the relationship between the sailing lagoon and the Upper Truckee River so that the river
controls the hydrology of the lagoon. The new lagoonal system would be analogous to what currently exists
along Trout Creek, but on a larger scale and similar to the Upper Truckee lagoon system prior to the
construction of the Tahoe Keys development. The lagoon would be constructed just west of the Upper
Truckee River. At flow events greater than bankfull, water would overtop the river’s banks and begin to flow
into the lagoon. Local cut and fill would be used to re-contour the topography of the lagoon and decrease its
depth.

►

Constructing a full-service visitor and interpretive center on a Conservancy-owned parcel on high capability
land near the end of Venice Drive and a small self-service visitor and interpretive center along the existing
bike trail near Trout Creek Bridge. The full-service facility would be fully staffed and would likely require a
concessionaire to support its maintenance costs. It could have office space included, for instance, for the
Conservancy or an appropriate non-profit entity to rent. The full-service facility would contain public
restrooms. A new parking lot would be located adjacent to the full-service visitor and interpretive center near
the end of Venice Drive.

►

Developing an interpretive program and installing additional interpretive signage in appropriate locations
throughout the site.

►

Reconfiguring the channel dimensions and raising the streambed due to prompted channel aggradation from
the hydraulic structures, which would decrease channel capacity.

►

Re-routing the trail providing public access to Cove East Beach west of the sailing lagoon on a new levee
parallel to the marina channel. This would allow integration of the sailing lagoon into an Upper Truckee
River-lagoon complex.

►

Enhancing the existing trail alignment providing access to Cove East Beach by constructing a spur trail and
boardwalk to an observation platform near the river mouth. The platform would provide a view across the
river mouth and the meadow and lagoon to the east, as well as out across the lake. The boardwalk railings and
its height above the ground would help keep people off the sandy areas during periods of low lake level.

►

Constructing new trails and boardwalks along the eastern perimeter of the site to help direct and control
existing pedestrian access to Barton Meadow, and in particular to the interior of the site. Wet swales and low
mounds would be used to discourage visitor access to the sensitive areas in the center of the marsh. The
function of boardwalks would be to raise people out of the wetter portions of the site where they currently
walk and damage wetland vegetation.

►

Providing a raised boardwalk connection to the beach. An observation platform would be constructed at the
end of the boardwalk to provide an overlook of the lake, beach, and the wetland, while discouraging entry
onto the beach itself.

►

Providing a raised boardwalk for both pedestrians and cyclists that would cross Trout Creek in the southern
portion of the site, and link to existing bicycle trails at both ends. The boardwalk would allow visitors visual
access into the meadow and to the lake beyond, while minimizing the disturbance that large numbers of hikers
can have on meadow plants.

►

Constructing a Class I bike trail along Venice Drive.

►

Constructing a loop trail for both pedestrian and bicyclists through the wooded area north of Highland
Woods.

►

Constructing a river corridor barrier near the current river alignment to reduce wildlife disturbance.

►

Removing fill behind Harootunian Beach to recreate lagoon and wet meadow conditions.

►

Restoring sand ridges (“dunes”) at Cove East.

ALTERNATIVE 2. NEW CHANNEL – WEST MEADOW (MINIMUM RECREATION INFRASTRUCTURE)
Key elements specific to Alternative 2 include:
►

Excavating a new geomorphic bankfull capacity channel that re-establishes the existing meadow as an active
floodplain. Most of the new channel alignment would be located east of the existing channel. A hydraulic
structure would be constructed in the channel to facilitate the flow transition from the relatively low bed
elevation of the existing incised channel to the higher bed elevation of the new channel.

►

Creating a sinuous, single thread bankfull channel excavated east of the LWS and straightened reach that has
a sinuous planform, bankfull capacity, and active floodplain connection with the existing meadow surface.

►

Constructing a new river mouth with a reduced capacity and higher bed elevation west of the existing
location. This would provide the opportunity for a small area of beach restoration in the existing channel
location. Since this area is prime Tahoe yellow cress habitat, it is anticipated that Tahoe yellow cress would
expand in this beach restoration area.

►

Maintaining a low-flow channel in the same alignment, and providing hydraulic stress relief by excavating
portions of the meadow/terrace separating the split channel branches to create areas for high flow release.

►

Constructing a bulkhead at the sailing lagoon to cutoff its open connection with the marina and Lake Tahoe
and reconfiguring the relationship between the sailing lagoon and the Upper Truckee River so that the river
controls the hydrology of the lagoon. The new lagoonal system would be analogous to what currently exists
along Trout Creek, but on a larger scale and similar to the Upper Truckee River lagoon system prior to the
construction of the Tahoe Keys development. The new lagoon would be constructed just west of the Upper
Truckee River. At flow events greater than bankfull, water would overtop the river’s banks and begin to flow
into the lagoon. There would be no change to the dredged depth of the lagoon.

►

Developing an interpretive program and installing additional interpretive signage in appropriate locations
throughout the site. No new buildings, public restroom facilities, or additional buildings would be
constructed.

►

Reconfiguring the channel dimensions and raising the streambed by encouraging aggradation behind the
hydraulic structures would restore channel capacity.

►

Re-routing the trail providing public access to Cove East Beach to west of the sailing lagoon on a new levee
parallel to the marina channel. This would allow integration of the sailing lagoon into an Upper Truckee
River-lagoon complex.

►

Constructing view points (on-grade or elevated as observation platforms) on the eastern margin of the site at
the end of each of several streets where people currently access the site. The design intent of the view points
would be to discourage pedestrians and their pets from entering the site.

►

Maintaining the location of existing bicycle trails around the perimeter of the study area.

►

Constructing a river corridor barrier near the current river alignment to reduce wildlife disturbance.

►

Removing fill behind Harootunian Beach to recreate lagoon and wet meadow conditions.

►

Restoring sand ridges (“dunes”) at Cove East.

ALTERNATIVE 3. MIDDLE MARSH CORRIDOR (MODERATE RECREATION INFRASTRUCTURE)
Key elements specific to Alternative 3 include:
►

Creating a new geomorphic bankfull capacity pilot channel to connect the river with the existing network of
small channels in the middle of the marsh and re-establish an active floodplain on the existing meadow
surface. A hydraulic structure would be constructed in the existing channel to facilitate the flow transition
from the relatively low bed elevation of the existing incised channel to the higher bed elevation of the pilot

channel and existing meadow channels. No construction would occur within the main meadow’s channel
sections; the river flow paths would be dictated by natural processes.
►

Using the existing river mouth location, but reducing its capacity by narrowing with local cut and fill and
constructing a higher bed elevation with engineered grade controls that simulate the resistant horizontal layers
in the subsurface.

►

In the reach between U.S. 50 and the “Big Bend,” maintaining the low-flow channel in the same alignment,
and provide hydraulic stress relief by excavating portions of the meadow/terrace separating the split channel
branches to create areas for high flow release. Options for additional high flow conveyance under U.S. 50
could include bored overflow conduits.

►

Constructing a bulkhead at the sailing lagoon to cutoff its open connection with the marina and Lake Tahoe
and reconfiguring the relationship between the sailing lagoon and the Upper Truckee River so that the river
controls the hydrology of the lagoon. The new lagoonal system would be analogous to what currently exists
along Trout Creek, but on a larger scale and similar to the Upper Truckee lagoon system prior to the
construction of the Tahoe Keys development. Limited re-contouring would be used to adjust the contours and
edges of the lagoon.

►

Constructing a small self-service visitor and interpretive center just north of the cul-de-sac at the LWS. Public
restrooms would be included as part of the visitor’s center. A new parking lot would be located on a
Conservancy-owned parcel near the end of Venice Drive.

►

Developing an interpretive program and installing additional interpretive signage in appropriate locations
throughout the site.

►

Reconfiguring the channel dimensions and raising the streambed by encouraging aggradation behind the
hydraulic structures would restore channel capacity.

►

Re-routing the trail providing public access to Cove East Beach to west of the sailing lagoon on a new levee
parallel to the marina channel. This would allow integration of the sailing lagoon into an Upper Truckee
River-lagoon complex.

►

Constructing trails and boardwalks along the eastern perimeter of the site to help direct and control the
existing pedestrian access to Barton Meadow, and in particular to the interior of the site. Wet swales and low
mounds would also be used to discourage visitor access to the sensitive areas in the center of the marsh. The
function of boardwalks would be to raise people out of the wetter portions of the site where they currently
walk and damage wetland vegetation.

Limiting the eastern trail to the most frequently accessed central portion of the border, and no connection is
provided north across the wetland to the beach.

►

Maintaining existing bicycle trails around the perimeter of the study area.

►

Constructing a loop trail for both pedestrians and cyclists through the wooded area north of Highland Woods.

ALTERNATIVE 4. INSET FLOODPLAIN (MODERATE RECREATION INFRASTRUCTURE)
Alternative 4 is fundamentally different from Alternatives 1 through 3 in that the existing streambed elevation
would not be raised and no new channels would be excavated into the existing meadow/terrace surface. Key
elements specific to Alternative 4 include:
►

Excavating portions of the meadow surface along the corridor of the existing channel to create an inset
floodplain that would increase active floodplain area and flood storage for small magnitude events.

►

Using local cut and fill to reduce the width and capacity of the existing channel.

►

Creating a sinuous, single thread bankfull channel constructed along a similar alignment as the straightened
reach using local cut and fill.

►

Using the existing river mouth location, but reducing its capacity by narrowing it with local cut and fill.

►

Maintaining the low-flow channel in the same alignment, and providing hydraulic stress relief by excavating
portions of the meadow/terrace separating the split channel branches to create areas for high flow release.

►

Retaining the open connection between the sailing lagoon, the marina, and Lake Tahoe.

►

Constructing a small self-service visitor and interpretive center just north of the cul-de-sac at the LWS. Public
restrooms would be included as part of the visitor’s center. A new parking lot would be located on a
Conservancy-owned parcel near the end of Venice Drive.

►

Developing an interpretive program and installing additional interpretive signage in appropriate locations
throughout the site.

►

Constructing trails and boardwalks along the eastern perimeter of the site to help direct and control existing
pedestrian access to Barton Meadow, and in particular to the interior of the site. Wet swales and low mounds
would also be used to discourage visitor access to the sensitive areas in the center of the marsh. The function
of boardwalks would be to raise people out of the wetter portions of the site where they currently walk and
damage wetland vegetation.

Land Use. Land use impacts to be addressed in the EIR/EIS/EIS include changes to onsite uses, land use
compatibility, and community character. The EIR/EIS/EIS will also address consistency with the TRPA plan area
statement (PAS) requirements (PAS 100 and 102).
Hydrology, Geomorphology, and Water Quality. Alternatives 1-4 would restore a portion of the Upper Truckee
River with the intent to improve long-term water quality in the river and Lake Tahoe by reducing the reach’s
contribution of nutrients and suspended sediment to the river. Implementation of Alternatives 1-4 could create a
risk that short-term increases in sediment load during the construction period. Best Management Practices and
mitigation measures would be developed to address potential short-term impacts to water quality that are
identified in the EIR/EIS/EIS. Restoration of the river channel would change the hydrologic and geomorphic
processes of the river. The hydrologic analysis will focus primarily on assessing changes to flow patterns as
related to changes in channel form and function, support of restoration objectives, and avoidance of any increase
in flood hazard to developed land uses adjacent to the river. The geomorphic assessment will focus on potential
short- and long-term changes in sediment fate and transport and landscape-scale factors. The EIR/EIS/EIS will
also address long-term water quality monitoring needs.
Biological Resources (Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Vegetation and Wildlife). Alternatives 1-4 include
actions for enhancing or restoring native vegetation communities, protecting sensitive wildlife habitat areas from

excessive public use, and enhancing terrestrial and aquatic habitat values. These actions would affect the
distribution, extent, and quality of sensitive and common biological resources on the project site. Each alternative
was designed to result in long-term benefits to biological resources; however, construction of Alternatives 1-4
would remove or disturb terrestrial and aquatic habitats in some locations. Each alternative would result in
changes in existing public access to and recreational uses of the project site, which would influence future patterns
of disturbance on biological resources. The EIR/EIS/EIS will evaluate the potential indirect, direct, and
cumulative effects of each alternative on: 1) existing vegetation communities, wildlife habitats, and aquatic
resources; 2) common and ecologically significant vegetation, wildlife, and aquatic resources; and 3) specialstatus plant, wildlife, and aquatic species, including TRPA Special Interest Species. The relationship of project
effects to TRPA thresholds for vegetation, wildlife, and fisheries will be evaluated.
Earth Resources: Geology and Soils, and Land Capability and Coverage. Alternatives 1-4 would involve
grading and excavating for reconfiguration of a portion of the Upper Truckee River and changing site topography
for restoration purposes, including filling portions of the existing, degraded channel. The EIR/EIS/EIS will
describe potential environmental effects related to land capability and coverage, soils and geology, topographic
alteration, seismic hazards, slope stability, and erosion potential. If soil export outside of the study area is
necessary, potential disposal sites will be identified and evaluated.
Scenic Resources. Alternatives 1-4 would result in the changes to natural elements that contribute to the scenic
quality of the study area (e.g., river channel, river mouth, lagoon, vegetation), as well as changes related to the
installation of recreation-related structures (e.g., trails, boardwalks, viewing points, visitor center). Visibility of
these changes from the appropriate shoreline travel route on the lake and from U.S. 50, a TRPA-designated scenic
travel route, will be determined. Potential impacts from construction and operation of the alternatives will be
evaluated from sensitive viewpoints in or near the study area. Scenic effects will be evaluated in terms of
visibility of the alternatives, alteration of the visual setting, sensitivity of viewpoints, and potential effects on
TRPA scenic thresholds.
Public Access and Recreation. Construction and operation of Alternatives 1-4 would result in changes in existing
public access to and recreational uses of the study area. The study area is surrounded by residential neighborhoods
of South Lake Tahoe. PAS 102 on west side of the study area includes a priority for public access to the lake at
Cove East Beach. PAS 100, which occupies the center and east side of the study area, emphasizes resources
conservation. The location of a boat take-out site on the river differs among the alternatives, so impacts to
paddling use of the river will be evaluated. The EIR/EIS/EIS will evaluate the changes to existing recreation areas
and uses, the change to TRPA persons-at-one-time (PAOTs) allocations in the project area, the effect on TRPA
recreation thresholds, trail connectivity, and river access and crossings.

Cultural Resources. The study area is located on undeveloped land. The EIR/EIS/EIS will analyze the potential
for cultural resources to be located on or near the site and the potential for disturbance of known and/or
undiscovered cultural resources due to implementation of the proposed alternatives. Also, the proposed action
includes consideration of Native American cultural uses of the study area and how restoration can be compatible
with and support those uses. The EIR/EIS/EIS process will include consultation with the Washoe Tribe and
evaluation in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.
Transportation, Parking and Circulation. Alternatives 1-4 would generate short-term, construction-related
traffic. Long-term traffic generated by the recreational components will also be discussed. The transportation
analysis will include identification of major roadways that may be affected by the proposed alternatives, traffic
volumes on those roadways, overall operating conditions, public transit routes that may be affected by the
proposed alternatives, and major pedestrian or bicycle routes that may be affected by the proposed alternatives.
Air Quality. Alternatives 1-4 would involve construction emissions and generation of fugitive dust, as well as
generate construction traffic in the area, contributing pollutants to the air basin. The EIR/EIS/EIS will include an
assessment of short-term (i.e., construction) air quality impacts and long-term (i.e., operational) regional air
pollutant emissions, including mobile, stationary, and area source emissions.
Noise. The EIR/EIS/EIS will assess potential short-term (i.e., construction) noise impacts, relative to sensitive
receptors and their potential exposure. Noise levels of specific construction equipment will be determined and
resultant noise levels at nearby receptors (at given distances from the source) will be calculated. Long-term (i.e.,
operational) noise impacts, including increased noise from mobile, stationary, and area sources, will be assessed.
Public Services and Utilities. The public services and utilities section of the EIR/EIS/EIS will evaluate impacts
on power, water treatment and distribution, wastewater collection, solid waste collection and disposal, police
services, fire protection services, schools, and fire fuel management.
Hazards and Hazardous Materials. The EIR/EIS/EIS will assess whether potential hazardous materials may be
located in the study area. The EIR/EIS/EIS will also address hazardous materials issues related to adjoining
properties.
Agricultural and Mineral Resources. The proposed alternatives are not expected to affect agricultural or mineral
resources in the study area. Existing resources will be verified and discussed in the EIR/EIS/EIS.
Socioeconomics. With the exception of recreation, discussed above, the proposed alternatives are not expected to
significantly affect socioeconomic factors associated with the study area. The EIR/EIS/EIS will consider potential
economic impacts related to implementation of the proposed alternatives.

Growth Inducement. The effects of the proposed alternatives on growth inducement will be addressed in the
EIR/EIS/EIS; however, the proposed alternatives are not expected to induce or result in the growth of population
in the region, cause an increase in demand for employment opportunities, or cause an increase in other public
needs.
Cumulative Effects. The EIR/EIS/EIS will identify and describe recently approved and reasonably anticipated
non-river related projects in the South Lake Tahoe area and vicinity of the Upper Truckee Marsh, other river
restoration projects being contemplated for upstream reaches of the Upper Truckee River, and region-wide
planning efforts currently underway (e.g., Pathway 2007, the total maximum daily load [TMDL] requirement
being developed for the Upper Truckee River). The EIR/EIS/EIS will evaluate the combined effects of these
activities with the proposed action.
TRPA Threshold Carrying Capacities: The EIR/EIS/EIS will include assessment of the proposed action’s
compliance with and contribution to the attainment of threshold carrying capacities adopted by TRPA.

INTENDED USES OF THE EIR/EIS/EIS
The Conservancy, Reclamation, and TRPA will use this EIR/EIS/EIS to consider the environmental effects,
mitigation measures, and alternatives, when reviewing the proposed action for approval. The EIR/EIS/EIS will
serve as the State’s CEQA compliance document, as Reclamation’s NEPA compliance document, and as TRPA’s
compliance document with respect to its Compact and Chapter 5 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances. State
responsible and trustee agencies and federal cooperating agencies may also use this EIR/EIS/EIS, as needed, for
subsequent discretionary actions.

PUBLIC SCOPING
Public scoping meetings are being conducted to provide you with the opportunity to learn more about the
proposed action and to express oral comments about the content of the EIR/EIS/EIS, in addition to your
opportunity to submit written comments. The scoping meetings will be held at the following times and locations:

to eligible producing states and coastal
political subdivisions (CPSs) through a
grant program. The funds allocated to
each state are based on the proportion
of qualified OCS revenues offshore the
individual state to total qualified OCS
revenues from all states. In order to
receive funds, the states submit CIAP
narratives detailing how the funds will
be expended. Alabama, Alaska,
California, Louisiana, Mississippi, and
Texas are the only eligible states under
EPAct. Counties, parishes, or equivalent
units of government within those states
lying all or in part within the coastal
zone, as defined by section 304(1) of the
Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA)
1972, as amended, are the coastal
political subdivisions eligible for CIAP
funding, a total of 67 local jurisdictions.
To approve a plan, legislation requires
that the Secretary of the Interior must be
able to determine that the funds will be
used in accordance with EPAct criteria
and that projects will use the funds
according to the EPAct. To confirm
appropriate use of funds, MMS requires
affirmation of grantees meeting Federal,
state, and local laws and adequate
project descriptions. To accomplish
this, MMS is providing in its CIAP
Environmental Assessment a suggested
narrative format to be followed by each
applicant for a CIAP grant. This
narrative will assist MMS in its review
of applications to determine that
adequate and appropriate measures
were taken to meet the laws that affect
the proposed coastal projects. This
narrative will be submitted
electronically as part of the grant
application. At that time, applicants
will be obliged to fill out several OMBapproved standard forms as well. Most
of the eligible states and CPSs, as
experienced grant applicants, will be
familiar with this narrative request.
This information collection request
(ICR) addresses the narrative portion
only of the MMS CIAP grant program.
Frequency: On occasion.
Estimated Number and Description of
Respondents: Approximately 73 total
respondents. This includes 6 states and
67 boroughs, parishes, etc.
Estimated Reporting and
Recordkeeping ‘‘Hour’’ Burden: The
estimated annual ‘‘hour’’ burden for this
information collection is a total of
12,600 hours. In calculating the
burdens, we assumed that respondents
perform certain requirements in the
normal course of their activities. We
consider these to be usual and
customary and took that into account in
estimating the burden. There are
approximately six states and 67
parishes, boroughs, counties, etc.
Submissions are generally on an

occasion basis. The estimated annual
‘‘hour’’ burden for this information
collection is a total of 12,600 hours. We
expect each project narrative will take
42 hours to complete. We anticipate an
average of 300 projects per year. Based
on a cost factor of $50 per hour, we
estimate the total annual cost to
industry is $630,000 (42 hrs × 300
projects = 12,600 hrs × $50 per hour =
$630,000).
Estimated Reporting and
Recordkeeping ‘‘Non-Hour Cost’’
Burden: We have identified no
paperwork ‘‘non-hour cost’’ burdens
associated with the collection of
information.
Public Disclosure Statement: The PRA
(44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.) provides that an
agency may not conduct or sponsor a
collection of information unless it
displays a currently valid OMB control
number. Until OMB approves a
collection of information, you are not
obligated to respond.
Comments: Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of
the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.)
requires each agency ‘‘* * * to provide
notice * * * and otherwise consult
with members of the public and affected
agencies concerning each proposed
collection of information * * *’’
Agencies must specifically solicit
comments to: (a) Evaluate whether the
proposed collection of information is
necessary for the agency to perform its
duties, including whether the
information is useful; (b) evaluate the
accuracy of the agency’s estimate of the
burden of the proposed collection of
information; (c) enhance the quality,
usefulness, and clarity of the
information to be collected; and (d)
minimize the burden on the
respondents, including the use of
automated collection techniques or
other forms of information technology.
To comply with the public
consultation process according to
section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA (44
U.S.C. 3501, et seq.), we published a
Federal Register notice (71 FR 29666,

Reclamation (Reclamation), the TRPA,
and the California Tahoe Conservancy
(Conservancy), intend to prepare a joint
EIS/EIS/EIR. The EIS/EIS/EIR would
evaluate a joint Reclamation and TRPA
restoration project along the reach of the
Upper Truckee River that extends from
U.S. Highway 50 north to Lake Tahoe
and its adjacent wetland. The purpose
of the proposed action is to restore
natural geomorphic processes and
ecological functions in this lowest reach
of the Upper Truckee River and the
surrounding marsh to improve
ecological values of the study area and
help reduce the river’s discharge of
nutrients and sediment that diminish
Lake Tahoe’s clarity.
The Upper Truckee River and Marsh
Restoration Project is identified in
TRPA’s Environmental Improvement
Program (EIP) as a project that is
necessary to restore and maintain
environmental thresholds for the Lake
Tahoe Basin. EIP projects are designed
to achieve and maintain environmental
thresholds that protect Tahoe’s unique
and valued resources.
Two public scoping meetings will be
held to solicit comments from interested
parties to assist in determining the
scope of the environmental analysis,
including the alternatives to be
addressed, and to identify the
significant environmental issues related
to the proposed action.
DATES: The public scoping meeting
dates are:
• Tuesday, October 24, 2006, 12 to 2
p.m., South Lake Tahoe, California.
• Tuesday, October 24, 2006, 6 to 8
p.m., South Lake Tahoe, California.
In addition, the proposed project will
be an agenda item at a TRPA Governing
Board Meeting on Wednesday, October
25, 2006 in Stateline, Nevada (see
agenda item at http://www.trpa.org/
default.aspx?tabid=258).
All comments are requested to be
received by October 31, 2006.
ADDRESSES: Scoping meetings will be
held at the Inn By The Lake, Sierra

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

Background
The Upper Truckee River has been
substantially altered by land practices
during the past 150 years. Throughout
its watershed, the river has experienced
ecosystem degradation typical of what
has occurred elsewhere in the Basin.
The river has been modified from its
original conditions by human activities,
such as logging; livestock grazing; roads;
golf courses; an airport; and residential,
commercial and industrial
developments. These conditions have
resulted in increased sediment and
nutrient loads discharging into Lake
Tahoe from the river, which contribute
to the declining clarity of the lake.
Human influences have also resulted in
reduced habitat quality for plant,
wildlife, and fish species in the
watershed. Restoration of natural
processes and ecological functions of
the river is an important part of the
response to the decline in lake clarity.
Restoration planning for the marsh
began in the early 1990s with studies
conducted by the University of
California. In 1995, the Conservancy
commissioned a restoration planning
and design study, which identified a
tentatively preferred river restoration
concept 2 years later. However, it was
determined that river restoration
required use of the entire Upper
Truckee Marsh and, at that time the east
side of the marsh was not owned by the
Conservancy; therefore, this tentatively
selected concept could not be pursued.
In 1998, the Conservancy began
planning and design of an initial phase
of wetland restoration on a 23-acre
portion of a study area located on the
east side of the Upper Truckee River
near Lake Tahoe. This is an area, called
the Lower West Side Wetland
Restoration Project (LWS), where the
marsh had been previously filled during
the construction of the adjacent Tahoe
Keys. After careful investigations,
planning, and design; extensive
environmental review; and community
outreach, the Conservancy approved

PO 00000

Frm 00093

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

restoration of 12 acres of wetland
through fill removal as the LWS Project
in 2001. Construction commenced in
the summer of 2001 and was completed
in the summer of 2003. In 2000, the
Conservancy purchased 311 acres of
land in the center of the marsh from a
private party, bringing nearly the entire
Truckee Marsh into public ownership.
Currently, the majority of the study area
is owned by the Conservancy, including
the marsh and meadows surrounding
the lower reach of Trout Creek.
Restoration concepts encompassing the
whole marsh and the lower reach of the
river could be developed after the
acquisition. As part of this process, the
Conservancy has also conducted public
access and recreation use management
planning for the river, marsh, and
beach.
Initially, the Conservancy defined
project objectives and desired outcomes
to direct the restoration planning
process. A comprehensive evaluation
and documentation of the existing
natural processes and functions in the
study area were conducted to begin the
alternatives planning process. This
evaluation enabled the identification of
potential restoration opportunities and
constraints. Armed with detailed
information about the river and marsh
processes and ecological functions, the
Conservancy hosted a design charrette
(i.e., interactive workshop) for agencies
and other stakeholders to identify the
spectrum of potentially feasible
restoration ideas to be considered in the
development of concept plan
alternatives. Four alternative concept
plans, all developed to be potentially
feasible, were formulated to represent a
reasonable range of restoration
approaches. The four concepts
generated by this extensive process are
four action alternatives being evaluated
in the EIS/EIS/EIR. A preferred
alternative will be identified after public
review of the alternatives and public
comments are received on the Draft EIS/
EIS/EIR.
To date, key stages of the Upper
Truckee River and Wetland Restoration
project have included the following:
• Evaluating existing natural
processes and functions of the Upper
Truckee River and marsh in 2000 and
2001.
• Establishing project objectives and
desired outcomes in 2002, and updating
them in 2005.
• Defining restoration opportunities
and constraints in 2002 and 2003.
• Conducting a restoration design
charrette in 2003 to receive input from
stakeholders on project priorities,
concerns and constraints, and design
ideas.

barrier to reduce wildlife disturbance,
restoring sand dunes at Cove East, rerouting an existing recreational trail,
and developing several new recreational
components (i.e., full- and self-service
visitor centers, pedestrian and bicycle
trails, boardwalks, viewing platforms),
an interpretive program, and signage.
Alternative 2 would include
excavation of a new channel and fill of
a portion of the existing channel,
constructing a new river mouth,
changing the hydrologic connectivity of
the sailing lagoon, constructing a river
corridor barrier to reduce wildlife
disturbance, and restoring sand dunes at
Cove East, re-routing an existing
recreational trail, constructing
observation platforms, and developing
an interpretive program and signage.
Alternative 3 would include
excavation of a new channel and fill of
a portion of the existing channel,
reducing the capacity of the river
mouth, changing the hydrologic
connectivity of the sailing lagoon, rerouting an existing recreational trail,
developing several new recreational
components (i.e., self-service visitor
center, pedestrian and bicycle trails,
boardwalks, viewing platforms), and an
interpretive program and signage.
Alternative 4 would include
excavation of portions of the meadow
surface along the corridor of the existing
channel to create an inset floodplain,
reducing the capacity of the river
mouth, constructing a river corridor
barrier to reduce wildlife disturbance,
(i.e., self-service visitor center,
pedestrian and bicycle trails,
boardwalks, viewing platforms), and an
interpretive program and signage.
Under Alternative 5, existing
conditions on the project site would be
projected into the future.
Potential Federal involvement may
include the approval of the proposed
action and partial funding of the river
restoration component of the proposed
action. The EIS will be combined with
an EIR prepared by the Conservancy
pursuant to the CEQA and an EIS
prepared by the TRPA pursuant to its
Compact and Chapter 5 of the TRPA
Code of Ordinances.
Additional Information
The environmental review will be
conducted pursuant to NEPA, CEQA,
TRPA’s Compact and Chapter 5 of the
TRPA Code of Ordinances, the Federal
and State Endangered Species Acts, and
other applicable laws, to analyze the
potential environmental impacts of
implementing a range of feasible
alternatives. Public input on the range
of alternatives proposed for detailed

PO 00000

Frm 00094

consideration will be sought through the
public scoping process.
The EIS/EIS/EIR will assess potential
impacts to any Indian Trust Assets or
environmental justice issues. There are
no known Indian Trust Assets or
environmental justice issues associated
with the proposed action. Input about
concerns or issues related to Indian
Trust Assets are requested from
potentially affected federally recognized
Indian Tribes and individual Indians.
Our practice is to make comments,
including names, home addresses, home
phone numbers, and e-mail addresses of
respondents, available for public

documentable circumstances, this
information will be released. We will
always make submissions from
organizations or businesses, and from
individuals identifying themselves as
representatives or officials of
organizations or businesses, available
for public inspection in their entirety.

Project Summary

1.0 Project Summary
The California Tahoe Conservancy (Conservancy), U.S. Bureau of Reclamation
(Reclamation), and Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) are pursuing a
proposed restoration project along the reach of the Upper Truckee River that
extends from U.S. 50 north to Lake Tahoe, including the adjacent meadow and
wetland (Appendix Section B, Exhibits 1 and 2). The primary purpose of the
Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project is to restore natural
geomorphic processes and ecological functions along this reach of river. The
Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project is identified in TRPA’s
Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) as a project that is necessary to
restore and maintain environmental thresholds for the Lake Tahoe Basin (EIP
Project # 560). EIP projects are designed to achieve and maintain environmental
thresholds that protect Tahoe’s unique and valued resources.

Purpose and Need
The need for the project originates from the environmental degradation that the
Upper Truckee River has historically experienced as a result of human alterations
to the river and watershed. The purpose of the proposed action is to restore natural
geomorphic processes and ecological functions in this lowest reach of the Upper
Truckee River and the surrounding marsh to improve ecological values of the
restoration area and help reduce the river’s discharge of nutrients and sediment
that diminish Lake Tahoe’s clarity.

Project Objectives
The following basic objectives of the project were developed for the proposed
action to meet the purpose and need:
►

Objective 1: Restore natural and self-sustaining river and floodplain processes and
functions.

►

Objective 2: Protect, enhance, and restore naturally functioning habitats.

►

Objective 3: Restore and enhance fish and wildlife habitat quality.

►

►

Objective 4: Improve water quality through enhancement of natural physical and
biological processes.
Objective 5: Protect and, where feasible, expand Tahoe yellow cress populations.

Summary of Alternatives

2.0 Summary of Alternatives
An extensive evaluation and restoration planning process has been conducted to
identify potentially feasible approaches for restoration of the river and marsh. As
a result of that process, the following five alternatives, including four action
alternatives and a No-Project/No-Action Alternative, will be evaluated in the
project’s environmental document. The five alternatives are being evaluated in a
joint Environment Impact Report/Environmental Impact
Statement/Environmental Impact Statement (EIR/EIS/EIS) that complies with the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA), and Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) ordinances. The
alternatives are described and illustrated in the Notice of Preparation (NOP) of the
environmental document (see Appendix Section B). The five alternatives are
described below.
►

Alternative 1. Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation
Infrastructure)

►

Alternative 2. New Channel – West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure)

►

Alternative 3. Middle Marsh Corridor (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)

►

Alternative 4. Inset Floodplain (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)

►

Alternative 5. No Project/No Action

These alternatives are named for their approach to restoration of the Upper
Truckee River, and the associated level of recreation infrastructure. None of the
alternatives are designated as preferred at this time; rather, the lead agencies will
identify a preferred alternative after taking into consideration public comment on
this joint draft environmental impact report, environmental impact statement, and
environmental impact statement (DEIR/DEIS/DEIS). The preferred alternative
may be one of the five alternatives or a different combination of components from
these concept plans, but within the general scope of the range of alternatives.
Thus, at this stage of project planning, there is no necessary connection between
the recreation and public access approaches included in a particular alternative
and the river restoration strategy of that alternative.
In the EIR/EIS/EIS, each alternative will be evaluated at an equal level of detail.
(Please refer to the NOP in Appendix Section B for further information about the
alternatives.)

Summary of Alternatives

3.0 Scoping Process
3.1

General Description and Purpose of Scoping

Scoping is an initial and critically important component of the environmental
review process. Scoping is intended to assist in identifying the final range of
actions, alternatives, environmental resources, environmental issues, and
mitigation measures that will be analyzed in an environmental document. The
scoping process helps focus the environmental analysis on critical issues and
eliminate from detailed study those issues that are not critical to the decision at
hand.
Scoping is conducted as part of compliance with CEQA, NEPA, and TRPA Code
of Ordinances. Scoping can be conducted in various forms and may involve
numerous participants, but generally involves the solicitation of input from the
public and interested agencies to determine the scope, focus, and contents of an
environmental document.
3.1.1 CEQA Requirements
Scoping is a less formalized process under CEQA than under NEPA, but is
encouraged in the statute and State CEQA Guidelines. Scoping is recognized as a
means to help identify the range of actions, alternatives, environmental effects,
methods of assessment, and mitigation measures to be analyzed in depth in an
EIR, and eliminates from detailed study those issues that are found not to be
significant. Scoping is also an effective way to bring together and resolve the
concerns of interested federal, state, and local agencies; the proponent of the
action; and other interested persons, including project opponents.
Tools used to determine the scope of an EIR include early public and inter-agency
consultation, the NOP of an EIR, and scoping meetings with agencies and the
public. Of these tools, only the NOP is a mandatory requirement under CEQA for
the preparation of an EIR. Issuance of the NOP, similar to the Notice of Intent
(NOI) under NEPA, serves as the trigger for soliciting comments on the proposed
project. Scoping typically ends at the conclusion of a specified public comment
period, which is 30 days long for the CEQA process, although public involvement
continues throughout the project review and approval effort.
A scoping meeting is required if a project qualifies as being of statewide,
regional, or areawide significance, in compliance with Section 21083.9 of the
statute. The Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project qualifies for this
requirement. Notice of this scoping meeting is required to include specified
recipients, including responsible agencies, trustee agencies, and members of the
public who have requested notification. General public notice of a scoping
meeting is discretionary under CEQA; however, many lead agencies do conduct
Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project
Scoping Summary Report

December 2010

3.0

Scoping Process

public scoping meetings to obtain input about the scope and content of an EIR,
when they conduct the scoping meeting required by Section 21083.9 of CEQA.
The scoping meetings held for this project complied with these CEQA
requirements.
3.1.2 NEPA Requirements
NEPA requires a formal scoping process for the preparation of an EIS. Under
NEPA, scoping is the process by which a lead agency for EIS preparation solicits
input on the nature and extent of issues and impacts to be addressed in the EIS
and the methods by which they will be evaluated. NEPA specifically requires the
lead agency to consult with federal agencies having jurisdiction by law and/or
special expertise on the proposed action and/or alternatives and to solicit
information from the public during EIS preparation.
Section 1501.7 of the Council on Environmental Quality’s NEPA regulations
require the lead agency’s scoping process to:
►

►

►

►

invite affected federal, state, and local agencies, Indian tribes, project proponents,
and other interested persons to participate in the EIS process;
determine the potential significant environmental issues to be analyzed in depth in
the EIS;
identify and eliminate issues determined to be insignificant or addressed in other
documents;
allocate assignments among the lead agency and any cooperating agencies regarding
preparation of the EIS, including impact analysis and identification of mitigation
measures;

►

identify related environmental documents being prepared

►

identify other environmental review and consultation requirements; and

►

indicate the timing of the preparation of the environmental document and the lead
agency’s tentative planning and decision-making schedule.

Scoping should occur as early as possible after the lead agency decides to prepare
an EIS. The NEPA lead agency is required to publish a NOI in the Federal
Register announcing its intent to prepare an EIS. Although not specifically
required by NEPA, the lead agency may also hold scoping meetings. Scoping
must occur after the NOI is issued, but may occur earlier, as long as appropriate
public notice is provided and enough project information is available to allow the
public and relevant agencies to participate effectively.
While publication of the NOI serves as the trigger for starting the scoping process,
there is no equivalent activity to mark its conclusion until public release of the
Draft EIS. To encourage submission of comments and information early in the
environmental review process, NEPA lead agency often identifies a date by which
December 2010
8

Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project
Scoping Summary Report

3.0

Scoping Process

scoping comments should be received. For the Upper Truckee River and Marsh
Restoration Project, the NOI identified October 31, 2006 as the date by which
scoping comments were requested to be received. The scoping period was later
extended to April 30, 2007 (see Appendix Section B). Often, the NEPA lead
agency prepares a scoping report to summarize the issues raised during the
scoping process and to publicize any decisions that have been made during the
scoping process. This report can serve as closure to the scoping process and an
assurance that the NEPA lead agency will consider comments received during
that process.
3.1.3 TRPA Requirements
TRPA is required to consult with and obtain the comments of any Federal, State
or local agency that has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to
environmental impacts associated with the project. While TRPA rules and
ordinances do not require the release of an NOP or mandate conducting formal
public scoping meetings, TRPA typically releases an NOP early in the
environmental review process and holds scoping meetings before the Advisory
Planning Commission (APC) and Governing Board (GB) to provide opportunity
for APC and GB members, agencies, and member of the public to provide input
on the project.

3.2 Public Outreach Efforts for the Upper Truckee
River and Marsh Restoration Project
Several outreach efforts have been undertaken to inform stakeholders about the
Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project, including public meetings
during early study phases and development of the project alternatives, as well as
the scoping process. The environmental document scoping process supplements
this early public input process. The public comment time period of the scoping
process has been from the release of the initial scoping-related public notice (NOP
release on October 5, 2006) to the conclusion of the last scoping public comment
period on April 30, 2007. The outreach efforts made to encourage public and
agency input during this scoping period are described below.
3.2.1 Informational Notices
Notice of Intent

Reclamation published the NOI in the Federal Register on October 19, 2006. The
NOI provides a summary of the proposed project and project background,
describes the proposed alternatives, presents information on the scoping meetings,
provides Conservancy, Reclamation, and TRPA contacts. Information about how
to obtain copies of the NOI was made available to scoping meeting attendees, and
an electronic version of the document was posted on the project website (see
below). The NOI, as published in the Federal Register, is included as Appendix
Section A.

Scoping Process

Notice of Preparation

The Conservancy and TRPA filed the NOP with the California and Nevada State
Clearinghouses and released it publicly on October 4, 2006. The NOP identified
November 2, 2006 as the closing date for submitting scoping comments. A
continuation was filed on March 13, 2007, to extend the closing date for scoping
comments to April 30, 2007. The NOP provides notice of the scoping meetings,
presents an overview of the proposed project and alternatives, statement of the
purpose of and need and objectives for the project, summarizes the proposed
alternatives, lists the issues anticipated to be addressed in the EIR/EIS/EIS, and
provides contact information. In addition to State Clearinghouse distribution to
potentially interested state agencies in both California and Nevada, copies of the
NOP were mailed to property owners (within 300 feet of the study area
boundaries) and other parties known to have an interest in the restoration project.
The NOP is included in Appendix Section B.
Upper Truckee Update

The Conservancy has distributed three editions of a newsletter for the project, The
Upper Truckee Update. To-date, project newsletters have included information
about the project’s history and background, project objectives, and the proposed
alternatives and an overview of the alternatives development process. The
newsletters also described the environmental review process, solicited for public
input and noticed the two public scoping meetings that were held in the afternoon
and evening of October 24, 2006.
The first and second editions were mailed to property owners near the study area,
agencies, organizations and the general public in October 2002 and October 2006,
respectively. The second edition was also made available at the public scoping
meetings, the Conservancy office’s front desk, and Upper Truckee Marsh public
access points. The third edition has been made available at the Conservancy’s front
desk and Upper Truckee Marsh public access points. All newsletters are available
on the project website (see below) and are included in Appendix Section C.
Newspaper Advertisement

The Conservancy placed a newspaper advertisement in the Tahoe Daily Tribune,
the primary newspaper in the area of the restoration project on October 20, 2006.
The advertisement announced the lead agencies’ intention to prepare an
EIR/EIS/EIS, the places and times of the scoping meetings and the TRPA GB
Meeting, Conservancy and TRPA contact information, and the availability of
information on the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration website.
Appendix Section D contains a copy of this notice.
Website

During the scoping process, the Conservancy maintained a project website for the
Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project (which was at
http://www.uppertruckeemarsh.com) that contained project history and
background, information about the study area, project objectives, alternatives
descriptions, project schedule, contact information, and an electronic submittal

form for the public to request being added to the project’s mailing list. Scoping
meeting information was posted on the website on October 4, 2006, the day on
which the NOP was published.
3.2.2 Scoping Meetings
Two public scoping meetings were held in the afternoon and evening of October
24, 2006 to provide opportunities for interested parties to learn about the proposed
project and alternatives and to provide input regarding the alternatives and scope
of the environmental document. The project was also presented as an information
item to TRPA’s APC and GB at the October 11 and October 25, 2006 meetings.
In addition to receiving comments from APC and GB members, the public was
also asked to provide input on the project at these two meetings.
During the October 24 public scoping meetings, comment cards1 were made
available to participants, and maps describing the alternatives were displayed and
discussed. Each meeting included a presentation describing the project
background and objectives, the proposed alternatives, the environmental review
process and tentative schedule, the project website URL, and public participation
opportunities. Scoping and TRPA meeting locations, dates, and times were as

Federal Register / Vol. 71, No. 202 / Thursday, October 19, 2006 / Notices
to eligible producing states and coastal
political subdivisions (CPSs) through a
grant program. The funds allocated to
each state are based on the proportion
of qualified OCS revenues offshore the
individual state to total qualified OCS
revenues from all states. In order to
receive funds, the states submit CIAP
narratives detailing how the funds will
be expended. Alabama, Alaska,
California, Louisiana, Mississippi, and
Texas are the only eligible states under
EPAct. Counties, parishes, or equivalent
units of government within those states
lying all or in part within the coastal
zone, as defined by section 304(1) of the
Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA)
1972, as amended, are the coastal
political subdivisions eligible for CIAP
funding, a total of 67 local jurisdictions.
To approve a plan, legislation requires
that the Secretary of the Interior must be
able to determine that the funds will be
used in accordance with EPAct criteria
and that projects will use the funds
according to the EPAct. To confirm
appropriate use of funds, MMS requires
affirmation of grantees meeting Federal,
state, and local laws and adequate
project descriptions. To accomplish
this, MMS is providing in its CIAP
Environmental Assessment a suggested
narrative format to be followed by each
applicant for a CIAP grant. This
narrative will assist MMS in its review
of applications to determine that
adequate and appropriate measures
were taken to meet the laws that affect
the proposed coastal projects. This
narrative will be submitted
electronically as part of the grant
application. At that time, applicants
will be obliged to fill out several OMBapproved standard forms as well. Most
of the eligible states and CPSs, as
experienced grant applicants, will be
familiar with this narrative request.
This information collection request
(ICR) addresses the narrative portion
only of the MMS CIAP grant program.
Frequency: On occasion.
Estimated Number and Description of
Respondents: Approximately 73 total
respondents. This includes 6 states and
67 boroughs, parishes, etc.
Estimated Reporting and
Recordkeeping ‘‘Hour’’ Burden: The
estimated annual ‘‘hour’’ burden for this
information collection is a total of
12,600 hours. In calculating the
burdens, we assumed that respondents
perform certain requirements in the
normal course of their activities. We
consider these to be usual and
customary and took that into account in
estimating the burden. There are
approximately six states and 67
parishes, boroughs, counties, etc.
Submissions are generally on an

occasion basis. The estimated annual
‘‘hour’’ burden for this information
collection is a total of 12,600 hours. We
expect each project narrative will take
42 hours to complete. We anticipate an
average of 300 projects per year. Based
on a cost factor of $50 per hour, we
estimate the total annual cost to
industry is $630,000 (42 hrs × 300
projects = 12,600 hrs × $50 per hour =
$630,000).
Estimated Reporting and
Recordkeeping ‘‘Non-Hour Cost’’
Burden: We have identified no
paperwork ‘‘non-hour cost’’ burdens
associated with the collection of
information.
Public Disclosure Statement: The PRA
(44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.) provides that an
agency may not conduct or sponsor a
collection of information unless it
displays a currently valid OMB control
number. Until OMB approves a
collection of information, you are not
obligated to respond.
Comments: Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of
the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.)
requires each agency ‘‘* * * to provide
notice * * * and otherwise consult
with members of the public and affected
agencies concerning each proposed
collection of information * * *’’
Agencies must specifically solicit
comments to: (a) Evaluate whether the
proposed collection of information is
necessary for the agency to perform its
duties, including whether the
information is useful; (b) evaluate the
accuracy of the agency’s estimate of the
burden of the proposed collection of
information; (c) enhance the quality,
usefulness, and clarity of the
information to be collected; and (d)
minimize the burden on the
respondents, including the use of
automated collection techniques or
other forms of information technology.
To comply with the public
consultation process according to
section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA (44
U.S.C. 3501, et seq.), we published a
Federal Register notice (71 FR 29666,
May 23, 2006) outlining the collection
of information and announcing that we
would submit this ICR to OMB for
approval. The notice provided the
required 60-day comment period. We
have received no comments in response
to this effort.
If you wish to comment in response
to this notice, you may send your
comments to the offices listed under the
ADDRESSES section of this notice. OMB
has up to 60 days to approve or
disapprove the information collection
but may respond after 30 days.
Therefore, to ensure maximum
consideration, OMB should receive

Public Comment Procedures: MMS’s
practice is to make comments, including
names and addresses of respondents,
available for public review. If you wish
your name and/or address to be
withheld, you must state this
prominently at the beginning of your
comment. MMS will honor the request
to the extent allowable by the law;
however, anonymous comments will
not be considered. There may be
circumstances in which we would
withhold from the record a respondent’s
identity, as allowable by the law. If you
wish us to withhold your name and/or
address, you must state this
prominently at the beginning of your
comment. In addition, you must present
a rationale for withholding this
information. This rationale must
demonstrate that disclosure ‘‘would
constitute an unwarranted invasion of
privacy.’’ Unsupported assertions will
not meet this burden. In the absence of
exceptional, documentable
circumstances, this information will be
released. All submissions from
organizations or businesses, and from
individuals identifying themselves as
representatives or officials of
organizations or businesses, will be
made available for public inspection in
their entirety.

Reclamation (Reclamation), the TRPA,
and the California Tahoe Conservancy
(Conservancy), intend to prepare a joint
EIS/EIS/EIR. The EIS/EIS/EIR would
evaluate a joint Reclamation and TRPA
restoration project along the reach of the
Upper Truckee River that extends from
U.S. Highway 50 north to Lake Tahoe
and its adjacent wetland. The purpose
of the proposed action is to restore
natural geomorphic processes and
ecological functions in this lowest reach
of the Upper Truckee River and the
surrounding marsh to improve
ecological values of the study area and
help reduce the river’s discharge of
nutrients and sediment that diminish
Lake Tahoe’s clarity.
The Upper Truckee River and Marsh
Restoration Project is identified in
TRPA’s Environmental Improvement
Program (EIP) as a project that is
necessary to restore and maintain
environmental thresholds for the Lake
Tahoe Basin. EIP projects are designed
to achieve and maintain environmental
thresholds that protect Tahoe’s unique
and valued resources.
Two public scoping meetings will be
held to solicit comments from interested
parties to assist in determining the
scope of the environmental analysis,
including the alternatives to be
addressed, and to identify the
significant environmental issues related
to the proposed action.
DATES: The public scoping meeting
dates are:
• Tuesday, October 24, 2006, 12 to 2
p.m., South Lake Tahoe, California.
• Tuesday, October 24, 2006, 6 to 8
p.m., South Lake Tahoe, California.
In addition, the proposed project will
be an agenda item at a TRPA Governing
Board Meeting on Wednesday, October
25, 2006 in Stateline, Nevada (see

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

Background
The Upper Truckee River has been
substantially altered by land practices
during the past 150 years. Throughout
its watershed, the river has experienced
ecosystem degradation typical of what
has occurred elsewhere in the Basin.
The river has been modified from its
original conditions by human activities,
such as logging; livestock grazing; roads;
golf courses; an airport; and residential,
commercial and industrial
developments. These conditions have
resulted in increased sediment and
nutrient loads discharging into Lake
Tahoe from the river, which contribute
to the declining clarity of the lake.
Human influences have also resulted in
reduced habitat quality for plant,
wildlife, and fish species in the
watershed. Restoration of natural
processes and ecological functions of
the river is an important part of the
response to the decline in lake clarity.
Restoration planning for the marsh
began in the early 1990s with studies
conducted by the University of
California. In 1995, the Conservancy
commissioned a restoration planning
and design study, which identified a
tentatively preferred river restoration
concept 2 years later. However, it was
determined that river restoration
required use of the entire Upper
Truckee Marsh and, at that time the east
side of the marsh was not owned by the
Conservancy; therefore, this tentatively
selected concept could not be pursued.
In 1998, the Conservancy began
planning and design of an initial phase
of wetland restoration on a 23-acre
portion of a study area located on the
east side of the Upper Truckee River
near Lake Tahoe. This is an area, called
the Lower West Side Wetland
Restoration Project (LWS), where the
marsh had been previously filled during
the construction of the adjacent Tahoe
Keys. After careful investigations,
planning, and design; extensive
environmental review; and community
outreach, the Conservancy approved

PO 00000

Frm 00093

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

restoration of 12 acres of wetland
through fill removal as the LWS Project
in 2001. Construction commenced in
the summer of 2001 and was completed
in the summer of 2003. In 2000, the
Conservancy purchased 311 acres of
land in the center of the marsh from a
private party, bringing nearly the entire
Truckee Marsh into public ownership.
Currently, the majority of the study area
is owned by the Conservancy, including
the marsh and meadows surrounding
the lower reach of Trout Creek.
Restoration concepts encompassing the
whole marsh and the lower reach of the
river could be developed after the
acquisition. As part of this process, the
Conservancy has also conducted public
access and recreation use management
planning for the river, marsh, and
beach.
Initially, the Conservancy defined
project objectives and desired outcomes
to direct the restoration planning
process. A comprehensive evaluation
and documentation of the existing
natural processes and functions in the
study area were conducted to begin the
alternatives planning process. This
evaluation enabled the identification of
potential restoration opportunities and
constraints. Armed with detailed
information about the river and marsh
processes and ecological functions, the
Conservancy hosted a design charrette
(i.e., interactive workshop) for agencies
and other stakeholders to identify the
spectrum of potentially feasible
restoration ideas to be considered in the
development of concept plan
alternatives. Four alternative concept
plans, all developed to be potentially
feasible, were formulated to represent a
reasonable range of restoration
approaches. The four concepts
generated by this extensive process are
four action alternatives being evaluated
in the EIS/EIS/EIR. A preferred
alternative will be identified after public
review of the alternatives and public
comments are received on the Draft EIS/
EIS/EIR.
To date, key stages of the Upper
Truckee River and Wetland Restoration
project have included the following:
• Evaluating existing natural
processes and functions of the Upper
Truckee River and marsh in 2000 and
2001.
• Establishing project objectives and
desired outcomes in 2002, and updating
them in 2005.
• Defining restoration opportunities
and constraints in 2002 and 2003.
• Conducting a restoration design
charrette in 2003 to receive input from
stakeholders on project priorities,
concerns and constraints, and design
ideas.

barrier to reduce wildlife disturbance,
restoring sand dunes at Cove East, rerouting an existing recreational trail,
and developing several new recreational
components (i.e., full- and self-service
visitor centers, pedestrian and bicycle
trails, boardwalks, viewing platforms),
an interpretive program, and signage.
Alternative 2 would include
excavation of a new channel and fill of
a portion of the existing channel,
constructing a new river mouth,
changing the hydrologic connectivity of
the sailing lagoon, constructing a river
corridor barrier to reduce wildlife
disturbance, and restoring sand dunes at
Cove East, re-routing an existing
recreational trail, constructing
observation platforms, and developing
an interpretive program and signage.
Alternative 3 would include
excavation of a new channel and fill of
a portion of the existing channel,
reducing the capacity of the river
mouth, changing the hydrologic
connectivity of the sailing lagoon, rerouting an existing recreational trail,
developing several new recreational
components (i.e., self-service visitor
center, pedestrian and bicycle trails,
boardwalks, viewing platforms), and an
interpretive program and signage.
Alternative 4 would include
excavation of portions of the meadow
surface along the corridor of the existing
channel to create an inset floodplain,
reducing the capacity of the river
mouth, constructing a river corridor
barrier to reduce wildlife disturbance,
(i.e., self-service visitor center,
pedestrian and bicycle trails,
boardwalks, viewing platforms), and an
interpretive program and signage.
Under Alternative 5, existing
conditions on the project site would be
projected into the future.
Potential Federal involvement may
include the approval of the proposed
action and partial funding of the river
restoration component of the proposed
action. The EIS will be combined with
an EIR prepared by the Conservancy
pursuant to the CEQA and an EIS
prepared by the TRPA pursuant to its
Compact and Chapter 5 of the TRPA
Code of Ordinances.
Additional Information
The environmental review will be
conducted pursuant to NEPA, CEQA,
TRPA’s Compact and Chapter 5 of the
TRPA Code of Ordinances, the Federal
and State Endangered Species Acts, and
other applicable laws, to analyze the
potential environmental impacts of
implementing a range of feasible
alternatives. Public input on the range
of alternatives proposed for detailed

PO 00000

Frm 00094

Project Title:

Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project

Project Location:

The Upper Truckee River drains the largest watershed in the Lake Tahoe Basin. The
Upper Truckee Marsh is located on the south shore of Lake Tahoe where the river enters
the lake. The study area for the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project is
generally bounded by U.S. Highway 50 (U.S. 50) and the Highland Woods neighborhood
on the south, the Al Tahoe neighborhood on the east, and Tahoe Islands/Sky Meadows

and Tahoe Keys neighborhoods on the west (Exhibit 1). The study area is approximately
592 acres, and includes parcels owned by the California Tahoe Conservancy
(Conservancy), other public agencies, and private landowners (Exhibit 2). It includes the
downstream reaches of Trout Creek and the Upper Truckee River, adjacent wetland and
uplands habitats, and the Lower West Side (LWS) Wetlands Restoration Project site
(located in the northwest portion of the study area, just east of the Tahoe Keys Marina).
The Conservancy, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), and the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency
(TRPA) are preparing a joint EIR/EIS/EIS for the Upper Truckee Marsh Restoration Project (project). This joint
document will serve as an EIR prepared by the Conservancy pursuant to the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA); an EIS prepared by Reclamation pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and
the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations Implementing NEPA; and an EIS prepared by TRPA
pursuant to its Compact and Chapter 5 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances. This notice meets the CEQA and TRPA
noticing requirements for a Notice of Preparation (NOP). Reclamation has prepared a separate notice that meets

processes and ecological functions along this reach of river. The Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration
Project is identified in TRPA’s Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) as a project that is necessary to
restore and maintain environmental thresholds for the Lake Tahoe Basin. EIP projects are designed to achieve and
maintain environmental thresholds that protect Tahoe’s unique and valued resources.
An extensive evaluation and restoration planning process has been conducted to identify potentially feasible
approaches for restoration of the river and marsh. As a result of that process, the following five alternatives,
including four action alternatives and a No Project/No Action Alternative, are intended to be evaluated in the
EIR/EIS/EIS.
►

Alternative 1. Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)

►

Alternative 2. New Channel – West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure)

►

Alternative 3. Middle Marsh Corridor (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)

►

Alternative 4. Inset Floodplain (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)

►

Alternative 5. No Project/No Action

These alternatives are named for their approach to restoration of the Upper Truckee River, and the associated
level of recreation infrastructure, and are described in more detail below.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
BACKGROUND
The Upper Truckee River has been substantially altered by land practices during the past 150 years. Throughout
its watershed, the river has experienced ecosystem degradation typical of what has occurred elsewhere in the
Basin. The river has been modified from its original conditions by human activities, such as logging; livestock
grazing; roads; golf courses; an airport; and residential, commercial and industrial developments. These
conditions have resulted in increased sediment and nutrient loads discharging into Lake Tahoe from the river,
which contribute to the declining clarity of the lake. Human influences have also resulted in reduced habitat
quality for plant, wildlife, and fish species in the watershed. Restoration of natural processes and ecological
functions of the river is an important part of the response to the decline in lake clarity.
Restoration planning for the marsh began in the early 1990’s with studies conducted by the University of
California. In 1995, the Conservancy commissioned a restoration planning and design study, which identified a
tentatively preferred river restoration concept two years later. However, it was determined that river restoration
required use of the entire Upper Truckee Marsh, and at that time the east side of the marsh was not owned by the
Conservancy; therefore, this tentatively selected concept could not be pursued. In 1998, the Conservancy began
planning and design of an initial phase of wetland restoration on a 23-acre portion of a study area located on the

east side of the Upper Truckee River near Lake Tahoe (Exhibit 2). This is an area, called the Lower West Side
Wetland Restoration Project (LWS), where the marsh had been previously filled during the construction of the
adjacent Tahoe Keys. After careful investigations, planning, and design; extensive environmental review; and
community outreach, the Conservancy approved restoration of 12 acres of wetland through fill removal as the
LWS Project in 2001. Construction commenced in the summer of 2001 and was completed in the summer of
2003.
In 2000, the Conservancy purchased 311 acres of land in the center of the marsh from a private party, bringing
nearly the entire Truckee Marsh into public ownership. Currently, the majority of the study area is owned by the
Conservancy, including the marsh and meadows surrounding the lower reach of Trout Creek. Restoration
concepts encompassing the whole marsh and the lower reach of the river could be developed after the acquisition.
As part of this process, the Conservancy has also conducted public access and recreation use management
planning for the river, marsh, and beach.
Initially, the Conservancy defined project objectives and desired outcomes to direct the restoration planning
process. A comprehensive evaluation and documentation of the existing natural processes and functions in the
study area were conducted to begin the alternatives planning process. This evaluation enabled the identification of
potential restoration opportunities and constraints. Armed with detailed information about the river and marsh
processes and ecological functions, the Conservancy hosted a design charrette (i.e., interactive workshop) for
agencies and other stakeholders to identify the spectrum of potentially feasible restoration ideas to be considered
in the development of concept plan alternatives. Four alternative concept plans, all developed to be potentially
feasible, were formulated to represent a reasonable range of restoration approaches. The four concepts generated
by this extensive process became the four action alternatives being evaluated in the EIR/EIS/EIS. A preferred
alternative will be identified after public review of the four alternatives and public comments are received on the
Draft EIR/EIS/EIS.
To date, key stages of the Upper Truckee Marsh Restoration project have included the following:
►

Evaluating existing natural processes and functions of the Upper Truckee River and marsh in 2000 and 2001

►

Establishing project objectives and desired outcomes in 2002, and updating them in 2005.

►

Defining restoration opportunities and constraints in 2002 and 2003

►

Conducting a restoration design charette in 2003 to receive input from stakeholders on project priorities,
concerns and constraints, and design ideas.

►

Conducting hydraulic modeling studies to support the development and evaluation of project alternatives.

Further refinement and evaluation of the alternatives, and preparation of a Concept Plan Report (July 2006).

PURPOSE AND NEED
The need for the project originates from the environmental degradation that the Upper Truckee River has
historically experienced as a result of human alterations to the river and watershed. The purpose of the proposed
action is to restore natural geomorphic processes and ecological functions in this lowest reach of the Upper
Truckee River and the surrounding marsh to improve ecological values of the study area and help reduce the
river’s discharge of nutrients and sediment that diminish Lake Tahoe’s clarity.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The following basic objectives of the project were developed for the proposed action to meet the purpose and
need:
Objective 1.

Restore natural and self-sustaining river and floodplain processes and functions

Objective 2.

Protect, enhance, and restore naturally functioning habitats

Objective 3.

Restore and enhance fish and wildlife habitat quality

Objective 4.

Improve water quality through enhancement of natural physical and biological processes

Objective 5.

Protect and, where feasible, expand Tahoe yellow cress populations

Objective 6.

Provide public access, access to vistas, and environmental education at the Lower West Side and
Cove East Beach

Objective 7.

Avoid increasing flood hazard on adjacent private property

Objective 8.

Design with sensitivity to the site’s history and cultural heritage

Objective 9.

Design the wetland/urban interface to help provide habitat value and water quality benefits

Objective 10.

Implement a public health and safety program, including mosquito monitoring and control

SUMMARY OF ALTERNATIVES
Four “action” alternatives, and the No Project/No Action Alternative, will be evaluated at an equal level of detail in
the EIR/EIS/EIS. The four action alternatives are illustrated in Exhibits 3 through 6 and are described below. It is
important to note that many of the individual components in each alternative are modular and could be transferred to
other alternatives, or recombined after environmental review to formulate different variations of the alternatives.

All four action alternatives include a recreation and public access component. These ideas are expressed at three
levels of development intensity with respect to recreation-related infrastructure (“maximum”, “minimum”, and
“moderate”). At this point in project planning, there is no necessary connection between the recreation and public
access approach included in a particular alternative and the river restoration strategy of that alternative. The level
of public access and recreational facilities included in the alternative selected for implementation would need to
be compatible with that alternative’s river and marsh restoration strategy.

ALTERNATIVE 1. CHANNEL AGGRADATION AND NARROWING (MAXIMUM RECREATION
INFRASTRUCTURE)
Key elements specific to Alternative 1 include:
►

Raising the bed elevation of the existing channel closer to the existing meadow surface as a means of reestablishing an active floodplain, which would be achieved by placing a series of structures in the channel
designed to alter hydraulics and intentionally cause sediment aggradation of the bed. Local cut and fill would
be used to narrow the channel. Bar development in the aggrading channel would also contribute to channel
narrowing.

►

Creating a sinuous, single thread bankfull channel excavated through the LWS.

►

Using the existing river mouth location, but reducing its capacity by narrowing it with local cut and fill and/or
placement of bioengineered structures to encourage sediment deposition.

►

Reconfiguring two sections of split channel from River Station (RS) 500 to RS 2,600. The low flow channel
would continue to flow through the east branch of the split channel from RS 500 to RS 1,400, but unlike
existing conditions, would continue in the second east branch channel from RS 1,400 to RS 2,600. The west
branches of the split channels would reduce the flow volume and hydraulic stress in the east low-flow channel
by conveying a portion of the high flow.

►

Constructing a bulkhead at the sailing lagoon to cutoff its open connection with the marina and Lake Tahoe
and reconfiguring the relationship between the sailing lagoon and the Upper Truckee River so that the river
controls the hydrology of the lagoon. The new lagoonal system would be analogous to what currently exists
along Trout Creek, but on a larger scale and similar to the Upper Truckee lagoon system prior to the
construction of the Tahoe Keys development. The lagoon would be constructed just west of the Upper
Truckee River. At flow events greater than bankfull, water would overtop the river’s banks and begin to flow
into the lagoon. Local cut and fill would be used to re-contour the topography of the lagoon and decrease its
depth.

►

Constructing a full-service visitor and interpretive center on a Conservancy-owned parcel on high capability
land near the end of Venice Drive and a small self-service visitor and interpretive center along the existing
bike trail near Trout Creek Bridge. The full-service facility would be fully staffed and would likely require a
concessionaire to support its maintenance costs. It could have office space included, for instance, for the
Conservancy or an appropriate non-profit entity to rent. The full-service facility would contain public
restrooms. A new parking lot would be located adjacent to the full-service visitor and interpretive center near
the end of Venice Drive.

►

Developing an interpretive program and installing additional interpretive signage in appropriate locations
throughout the site.

►

Reconfiguring the channel dimensions and raising the streambed due to prompted channel aggradation from
the hydraulic structures, which would decrease channel capacity.

►

Re-routing the trail providing public access to Cove East Beach west of the sailing lagoon on a new levee
parallel to the marina channel. This would allow integration of the sailing lagoon into an Upper Truckee
River-lagoon complex.

►

Enhancing the existing trail alignment providing access to Cove East Beach by constructing a spur trail and
boardwalk to an observation platform near the river mouth. The platform would provide a view across the
river mouth and the meadow and lagoon to the east, as well as out across the lake. The boardwalk railings and
its height above the ground would help keep people off the sandy areas during periods of low lake level.

►

Constructing new trails and boardwalks along the eastern perimeter of the site to help direct and control
existing pedestrian access to Barton Meadow, and in particular to the interior of the site. Wet swales and low
mounds would be used to discourage visitor access to the sensitive areas in the center of the marsh. The
function of boardwalks would be to raise people out of the wetter portions of the site where they currently
walk and damage wetland vegetation.

►

Providing a raised boardwalk connection to the beach. An observation platform would be constructed at the
end of the boardwalk to provide an overlook of the lake, beach, and the wetland, while discouraging entry
onto the beach itself.

►

Providing a raised boardwalk for both pedestrians and cyclists that would cross Trout Creek in the southern
portion of the site, and link to existing bicycle trails at both ends. The boardwalk would allow visitors visual
access into the meadow and to the lake beyond, while minimizing the disturbance that large numbers of hikers
can have on meadow plants.

►

Constructing a Class I bike trail along Venice Drive.

►

Constructing a loop trail for both pedestrian and bicyclists through the wooded area north of Highland
Woods.

►

Constructing a river corridor barrier near the current river alignment to reduce wildlife disturbance.

►

Removing fill behind Harootunian Beach to recreate lagoon and wet meadow conditions.

►

Restoring sand ridges (“dunes”) at Cove East.

ALTERNATIVE 2. NEW CHANNEL – WEST MEADOW (MINIMUM RECREATION INFRASTRUCTURE)
Key elements specific to Alternative 2 include:
►

Excavating a new geomorphic bankfull capacity channel that re-establishes the existing meadow as an active
floodplain. Most of the new channel alignment would be located east of the existing channel. A hydraulic
structure would be constructed in the channel to facilitate the flow transition from the relatively low bed
elevation of the existing incised channel to the higher bed elevation of the new channel.

►

Creating a sinuous, single thread bankfull channel excavated east of the LWS and straightened reach that has
a sinuous planform, bankfull capacity, and active floodplain connection with the existing meadow surface.

►

Constructing a new river mouth with a reduced capacity and higher bed elevation west of the existing
location. This would provide the opportunity for a small area of beach restoration in the existing channel
location. Since this area is prime Tahoe yellow cress habitat, it is anticipated that Tahoe yellow cress would
expand in this beach restoration area.

►

Maintaining a low-flow channel in the same alignment, and providing hydraulic stress relief by excavating
portions of the meadow/terrace separating the split channel branches to create areas for high flow release.

►

Constructing a bulkhead at the sailing lagoon to cutoff its open connection with the marina and Lake Tahoe
and reconfiguring the relationship between the sailing lagoon and the Upper Truckee River so that the river
controls the hydrology of the lagoon. The new lagoonal system would be analogous to what currently exists
along Trout Creek, but on a larger scale and similar to the Upper Truckee River lagoon system prior to the
construction of the Tahoe Keys development. The new lagoon would be constructed just west of the Upper
Truckee River. At flow events greater than bankfull, water would overtop the river’s banks and begin to flow
into the lagoon. There would be no change to the dredged depth of the lagoon.

►

Developing an interpretive program and installing additional interpretive signage in appropriate locations
throughout the site. No new buildings, public restroom facilities, or additional buildings would be
constructed.

►

Reconfiguring the channel dimensions and raising the streambed by encouraging aggradation behind the
hydraulic structures would restore channel capacity.

►

Re-routing the trail providing public access to Cove East Beach to west of the sailing lagoon on a new levee
parallel to the marina channel. This would allow integration of the sailing lagoon into an Upper Truckee
River-lagoon complex.

►

Constructing view points (on-grade or elevated as observation platforms) on the eastern margin of the site at
the end of each of several streets where people currently access the site. The design intent of the view points
would be to discourage pedestrians and their pets from entering the site.

►

Maintaining the location of existing bicycle trails around the perimeter of the study area.

►

Constructing a river corridor barrier near the current river alignment to reduce wildlife disturbance.

►

Removing fill behind Harootunian Beach to recreate lagoon and wet meadow conditions.

►

Restoring sand ridges (“dunes”) at Cove East.

ALTERNATIVE 3. MIDDLE MARSH CORRIDOR (MODERATE RECREATION INFRASTRUCTURE)
Key elements specific to Alternative 3 include:
►

Creating a new geomorphic bankfull capacity pilot channel to connect the river with the existing network of
small channels in the middle of the marsh and re-establish an active floodplain on the existing meadow
surface. A hydraulic structure would be constructed in the existing channel to facilitate the flow transition
from the relatively low bed elevation of the existing incised channel to the higher bed elevation of the pilot

channel and existing meadow channels. No construction would occur within the main meadow’s channel
sections; the river flow paths would be dictated by natural processes.
►

Using the existing river mouth location, but reducing its capacity by narrowing with local cut and fill and
constructing a higher bed elevation with engineered grade controls that simulate the resistant horizontal layers
in the subsurface.

►

In the reach between U.S. 50 and the “Big Bend,” maintaining the low-flow channel in the same alignment,
and provide hydraulic stress relief by excavating portions of the meadow/terrace separating the split channel
branches to create areas for high flow release. Options for additional high flow conveyance under U.S. 50
could include bored overflow conduits.

►

Constructing a bulkhead at the sailing lagoon to cutoff its open connection with the marina and Lake Tahoe
and reconfiguring the relationship between the sailing lagoon and the Upper Truckee River so that the river
controls the hydrology of the lagoon. The new lagoonal system would be analogous to what currently exists
along Trout Creek, but on a larger scale and similar to the Upper Truckee lagoon system prior to the
construction of the Tahoe Keys development. Limited re-contouring would be used to adjust the contours and
edges of the lagoon.

►

Constructing a small self-service visitor and interpretive center just north of the cul-de-sac at the LWS. Public
restrooms would be included as part of the visitor’s center. A new parking lot would be located on a
Conservancy-owned parcel near the end of Venice Drive.

►

Developing an interpretive program and installing additional interpretive signage in appropriate locations
throughout the site.

►

Reconfiguring the channel dimensions and raising the streambed by encouraging aggradation behind the
hydraulic structures would restore channel capacity.

►

Re-routing the trail providing public access to Cove East Beach to west of the sailing lagoon on a new levee
parallel to the marina channel. This would allow integration of the sailing lagoon into an Upper Truckee
River-lagoon complex.

►

Constructing trails and boardwalks along the eastern perimeter of the site to help direct and control the
existing pedestrian access to Barton Meadow, and in particular to the interior of the site. Wet swales and low
mounds would also be used to discourage visitor access to the sensitive areas in the center of the marsh. The
function of boardwalks would be to raise people out of the wetter portions of the site where they currently
walk and damage wetland vegetation.

Limiting the eastern trail to the most frequently accessed central portion of the border, and no connection is
provided north across the wetland to the beach.

►

Maintaining existing bicycle trails around the perimeter of the study area.

►

Constructing a loop trail for both pedestrians and cyclists through the wooded area north of Highland Woods.

ALTERNATIVE 4. INSET FLOODPLAIN (MODERATE RECREATION INFRASTRUCTURE)
Alternative 4 is fundamentally different from Alternatives 1 through 3 in that the existing streambed elevation
would not be raised and no new channels would be excavated into the existing meadow/terrace surface. Key
elements specific to Alternative 4 include:
►

Excavating portions of the meadow surface along the corridor of the existing channel to create an inset
floodplain that would increase active floodplain area and flood storage for small magnitude events.

►

Using local cut and fill to reduce the width and capacity of the existing channel.

►

Creating a sinuous, single thread bankfull channel constructed along a similar alignment as the straightened
reach using local cut and fill.

►

Using the existing river mouth location, but reducing its capacity by narrowing it with local cut and fill.

►

Maintaining the low-flow channel in the same alignment, and providing hydraulic stress relief by excavating
portions of the meadow/terrace separating the split channel branches to create areas for high flow release.

►

Retaining the open connection between the sailing lagoon, the marina, and Lake Tahoe.

►

Constructing a small self-service visitor and interpretive center just north of the cul-de-sac at the LWS. Public
restrooms would be included as part of the visitor’s center. A new parking lot would be located on a
Conservancy-owned parcel near the end of Venice Drive.

►

Developing an interpretive program and installing additional interpretive signage in appropriate locations
throughout the site.

►

Constructing trails and boardwalks along the eastern perimeter of the site to help direct and control existing
pedestrian access to Barton Meadow, and in particular to the interior of the site. Wet swales and low mounds
would also be used to discourage visitor access to the sensitive areas in the center of the marsh. The function
of boardwalks would be to raise people out of the wetter portions of the site where they currently walk and
damage wetland vegetation.

ALTERNATIVE 5. NO PROJECT/NO ACTION
Under Alternative 5, no changes to the river or marsh would be implemented and existing conditions in the study
area would be projected into the future.

POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS
The following subject areas include potential environmental effects associated with the range of alternatives
identified above. These issues will be explored further during project scoping and during preparation of the draft
EIR/EIS:
Land Use. Land use impacts to be addressed in the EIR/EIS/EIS include changes to onsite uses, land use
compatibility, and community character. The EIR/EIS/EIS will also address consistency with the TRPA plan area
statement (PAS) requirements (PAS 100 and 102).
Hydrology, Geomorphology, and Water Quality. Alternatives 1-4 would restore a portion of the Upper Truckee
River with the intent to improve long-term water quality in the river and Lake Tahoe by reducing the reach’s
contribution of nutrients and suspended sediment to the river. Implementation of Alternatives 1-4 could create a
risk that short-term increases in sediment load during the construction period. Best Management Practices and
mitigation measures would be developed to address potential short-term impacts to water quality that are
identified in the EIR/EIS/EIS. Restoration of the river channel would change the hydrologic and geomorphic
processes of the river. The hydrologic analysis will focus primarily on assessing changes to flow patterns as
related to changes in channel form and function, support of restoration objectives, and avoidance of any increase
in flood hazard to developed land uses adjacent to the river. The geomorphic assessment will focus on potential
short- and long-term changes in sediment fate and transport and landscape-scale factors. The EIR/EIS/EIS will
also address long-term water quality monitoring needs.
Biological Resources (Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Vegetation and Wildlife). Alternatives 1-4 include
actions for enhancing or restoring native vegetation communities, protecting sensitive wildlife habitat areas from

October 2006

18

excessive public use, and enhancing terrestrial and aquatic habitat values. These actions would affect the
distribution, extent, and quality of sensitive and common biological resources on the project site. Each alternative
was designed to result in long-term benefits to biological resources; however, construction of Alternatives 1-4
would remove or disturb terrestrial and aquatic habitats in some locations. Each alternative would result in
changes in existing public access to and recreational uses of the project site, which would influence future patterns
of disturbance on biological resources. The EIR/EIS/EIS will evaluate the potential indirect, direct, and
cumulative effects of each alternative on: 1) existing vegetation communities, wildlife habitats, and aquatic
resources; 2) common and ecologically significant vegetation, wildlife, and aquatic resources; and 3) specialstatus plant, wildlife, and aquatic species, including TRPA Special Interest Species. The relationship of project
effects to TRPA thresholds for vegetation, wildlife, and fisheries will be evaluated.
Earth Resources: Geology and Soils, and Land Capability and Coverage. Alternatives 1-4 would involve
grading and excavating for reconfiguration of a portion of the Upper Truckee River and changing site topography
for restoration purposes, including filling portions of the existing, degraded channel. The EIR/EIS/EIS will
describe potential environmental effects related to land capability and coverage, soils and geology, topographic
alteration, seismic hazards, slope stability, and erosion potential. If soil export outside of the study area is
necessary, potential disposal sites will be identified and evaluated.
Scenic Resources. Alternatives 1-4 would result in the changes to natural elements that contribute to the scenic
quality of the study area (e.g., river channel, river mouth, lagoon, vegetation), as well as changes related to the
installation of recreation-related structures (e.g., trails, boardwalks, viewing points, visitor center). Visibility of
these changes from the appropriate shoreline travel route on the lake and from U.S. 50, a TRPA-designated scenic
travel route, will be determined. Potential impacts from construction and operation of the alternatives will be
evaluated from sensitive viewpoints in or near the study area. Scenic effects will be evaluated in terms of
visibility of the alternatives, alteration of the visual setting, sensitivity of viewpoints, and potential effects on
TRPA scenic thresholds.
Public Access and Recreation. Construction and operation of Alternatives 1-4 would result in changes in existing
public access to and recreational uses of the study area. The study area is surrounded by residential neighborhoods
of South Lake Tahoe. PAS 102 on west side of the study area includes a priority for public access to the lake at
Cove East Beach. PAS 100, which occupies the center and east side of the study area, emphasizes resources
conservation. The location of a boat take-out site on the river differs among the alternatives, so impacts to
paddling use of the river will be evaluated. The EIR/EIS/EIS will evaluate the changes to existing recreation areas
and uses, the change to TRPA persons-at-one-time (PAOTs) allocations in the project area, the effect on TRPA
recreation thresholds, trail connectivity, and river access and crossings.

Cultural Resources. The study area is located on undeveloped land. The EIR/EIS/EIS will analyze the potential
for cultural resources to be located on or near the site and the potential for disturbance of known and/or
undiscovered cultural resources due to implementation of the proposed alternatives. Also, the proposed action
includes consideration of Native American cultural uses of the study area and how restoration can be compatible
with and support those uses. The EIR/EIS/EIS process will include consultation with the Washoe Tribe and
evaluation in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.
Transportation, Parking and Circulation. Alternatives 1-4 would generate short-term, construction-related
traffic. Long-term traffic generated by the recreational components will also be discussed. The transportation
analysis will include identification of major roadways that may be affected by the proposed alternatives, traffic
volumes on those roadways, overall operating conditions, public transit routes that may be affected by the
proposed alternatives, and major pedestrian or bicycle routes that may be affected by the proposed alternatives.
Air Quality. Alternatives 1-4 would involve construction emissions and generation of fugitive dust, as well as
generate construction traffic in the area, contributing pollutants to the air basin. The EIR/EIS/EIS will include an
assessment of short-term (i.e., construction) air quality impacts and long-term (i.e., operational) regional air
pollutant emissions, including mobile, stationary, and area source emissions.
Noise. The EIR/EIS/EIS will assess potential short-term (i.e., construction) noise impacts, relative to sensitive
receptors and their potential exposure. Noise levels of specific construction equipment will be determined and
resultant noise levels at nearby receptors (at given distances from the source) will be calculated. Long-term (i.e.,
operational) noise impacts, including increased noise from mobile, stationary, and area sources, will be assessed.
Public Services and Utilities. The public services and utilities section of the EIR/EIS/EIS will evaluate impacts
on power, water treatment and distribution, wastewater collection, solid waste collection and disposal, police
services, fire protection services, schools, and fire fuel management.
Hazards and Hazardous Materials. The EIR/EIS/EIS will assess whether potential hazardous materials may be
located in the study area. The EIR/EIS/EIS will also address hazardous materials issues related to adjoining
properties.
Agricultural and Mineral Resources. The proposed alternatives are not expected to affect agricultural or mineral
resources in the study area. Existing resources will be verified and discussed in the EIR/EIS/EIS.
Socioeconomics. With the exception of recreation, discussed above, the proposed alternatives are not expected to
significantly affect socioeconomic factors associated with the study area. The EIR/EIS/EIS will consider potential
economic impacts related to implementation of the proposed alternatives.

Growth Inducement. The effects of the proposed alternatives on growth inducement will be addressed in the
EIR/EIS/EIS; however, the proposed alternatives are not expected to induce or result in the growth of population
in the region, cause an increase in demand for employment opportunities, or cause an increase in other public
needs.
Cumulative Effects. The EIR/EIS/EIS will identify and describe recently approved and reasonably anticipated
non-river related projects in the South Lake Tahoe area and vicinity of the Upper Truckee Marsh, other river
restoration projects being contemplated for upstream reaches of the Upper Truckee River, and region-wide
planning efforts currently underway (e.g., Pathway 2007, the total maximum daily load [TMDL] requirement
being developed for the Upper Truckee River). The EIR/EIS/EIS will evaluate the combined effects of these
activities with the proposed action.
TRPA Threshold Carrying Capacities: The EIR/EIS/EIS will include assessment of the proposed action’s
compliance with and contribution to the attainment of threshold carrying capacities adopted by TRPA.

INTENDED USES OF THE EIR/EIS/EIS
The Conservancy, Reclamation, and TRPA will use this EIR/EIS/EIS to consider the environmental effects,
mitigation measures, and alternatives, when reviewing the proposed action for approval. The EIR/EIS/EIS will
serve as the State’s CEQA compliance document, as Reclamation’s NEPA compliance document, and as TRPA’s
compliance document with respect to its Compact and Chapter 5 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances. State
responsible and trustee agencies and federal cooperating agencies may also use this EIR/EIS/EIS, as needed, for
subsequent discretionary actions.

PUBLIC SCOPING
Public scoping meetings are being conducted to provide you with the opportunity to learn more about the
proposed action and to express oral comments about the content of the EIR/EIS/EIS, in addition to your
opportunity to submit written comments. The scoping meetings will be held at the following times and locations:

Project Title:

Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project

Project Location:

The Upper Truckee River drains the largest watershed in the Lake Tahoe Basin. The
Upper Truckee Marsh is located on the south shore of Lake Tahoe where the river enters
the lake. The study area for the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project is
generally bounded by U.S. Highway 50 (U.S. 50) and the Highland Woods neighborhood
on the south, the Al Tahoe neighborhood on the east, and Tahoe Islands/Sky Meadows

and Tahoe Keys neighborhoods on the west (Exhibit 1). The study area is approximately
592 acres, and includes parcels owned by the California Tahoe Conservancy
(Conservancy), other public agencies, and private landowners (Exhibit 2). It includes the
downstream reaches of Trout Creek and the Upper Truckee River, adjacent wetland and
uplands habitats, and the Lower West Side (LWS) Wetlands Restoration Project site
(located in the northwest portion of the study area, just east of the Tahoe Keys Marina).
The Conservancy, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), and the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency
(TRPA) are preparing a joint EIR/EIS/EIS for the Upper Truckee Marsh Restoration Project (project). This joint
document will serve as an EIR prepared by the Conservancy pursuant to the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA); an EIS prepared by Reclamation pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and
the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations Implementing NEPA; and an EIS prepared by TRPA
pursuant to its Compact and Chapter 5 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances. This notice meets the CEQA and TRPA
noticing requirements for a Notice of Preparation (NOP). Reclamation has prepared a separate notice that meets
NEPA requirements for a Notice of Intent (NOI) for publication in the Federal Register.

SUMMARY
The Conservancy, Reclamation, and TRPA are pursuing a restoration project along the reach of the Upper
Truckee River that extends from U.S. 50 north to Lake Tahoe, including the adjacent meadow and wetland. The
primary purpose of the Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project is to restore natural geomorphic

processes and ecological functions along this reach of river. The Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration
Project is identified in TRPA’s Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) as a project that is necessary to
restore and maintain environmental thresholds for the Lake Tahoe Basin. EIP projects are designed to achieve and
maintain environmental thresholds that protect Tahoe’s unique and valued resources.
An extensive evaluation and restoration planning process has been conducted to identify potentially feasible
approaches for restoration of the river and marsh. As a result of that process, the following five alternatives,
including four action alternatives and a No Project/No Action Alternative, are intended to be evaluated in the
EIR/EIS/EIS.
►

Alternative 1. Channel Aggradation and Narrowing (Maximum Recreation Infrastructure)

►

Alternative 2. New Channel – West Meadow (Minimum Recreation Infrastructure)

►

Alternative 3. Middle Marsh Corridor (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)

►

Alternative 4. Inset Floodplain (Moderate Recreation Infrastructure)

►

Alternative 5. No Project/No Action

These alternatives are named for their approach to restoration of the Upper Truckee River, and the associated
level of recreation infrastructure, and are described in more detail below.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
BACKGROUND
The Upper Truckee River has been substantially altered by land practices during the past 150 years. Throughout
its watershed, the river has experienced ecosystem degradation typical of what has occurred elsewhere in the
Basin. The river has been modified from its original conditions by human activities, such as logging; livestock
grazing; roads; golf courses; an airport; and residential, commercial and industrial developments. These
conditions have resulted in increased sediment and nutrient loads discharging into Lake Tahoe from the river,
which contribute to the declining clarity of the lake. Human influences have also resulted in reduced habitat
quality for plant, wildlife, and fish species in the watershed. Restoration of natural processes and ecological
functions of the river is an important part of the response to the decline in lake clarity.
Restoration planning for the marsh began in the early 1990’s with studies conducted by the University of
California. In 1995, the Conservancy commissioned a restoration planning and design study, which identified a
tentatively preferred river restoration concept two years later. However, it was determined that river restoration
required use of the entire Upper Truckee Marsh, and at that time the east side of the marsh was not owned by the
Conservancy; therefore, this tentatively selected concept could not be pursued. In 1998, the Conservancy began
planning and design of an initial phase of wetland restoration on a 23-acre portion of a study area located on the
Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project

east side of the Upper Truckee River near Lake Tahoe (Exhibit 2). This is an area, called the Lower West Side
Wetland Restoration Project (LWS), where the marsh had been previously filled during the construction of the
adjacent Tahoe Keys. After careful investigations, planning, and design; extensive environmental review; and
community outreach, the Conservancy approved restoration of 12 acres of wetland through fill removal as the
LWS Project in 2001. Construction commenced in the summer of 2001 and was completed in the summer of
2003.
In 2000, the Conservancy purchased 311 acres of land in the center of the marsh from a private party, bringing
nearly the entire Truckee Marsh into public ownership. Currently, the majority of the study area is owned by the
Conservancy, including the marsh and meadows surrounding the lower reach of Trout Creek. Restoration
concepts encompassing the whole marsh and the lower reach of the river could be developed after the acquisition.
As part of this process, the Conservancy has also conducted public access and recreation use management
planning for the river, marsh, and beach.
Initially, the Conservancy defined project objectives and desired outcomes to direct the restoration planning
process. A comprehensive evaluation and documentation of the existing natural processes and functions in the
study area were conducted to begin the alternatives planning process. This evaluation enabled the identification of
potential restoration opportunities and constraints. Armed with detailed information about the river and marsh
processes and ecological functions, the Conservancy hosted a design charrette (i.e., interactive workshop) for
agencies and other stakeholders to identify the spectrum of potentially feasible restoration ideas to be considered
in the development of concept plan alternatives. Four alternative concept plans, all developed to be potentially
feasible, were formulated to represent a reasonable range of restoration approaches. The four concepts generated
by this extensive process became the four action alternatives being evaluated in the EIR/EIS/EIS. A preferred
alternative will be identified after public review of the four alternatives and public comments are received on the
Draft EIR/EIS/EIS.
To date, key stages of the Upper Truckee Marsh Restoration project have included the following:
►

Evaluating existing natural processes and functions of the Upper Truckee River and marsh in 2000 and 2001

►

Establishing project objectives and desired outcomes in 2002, and updating them in 2005.

►

Defining restoration opportunities and constraints in 2002 and 2003

►

Conducting a restoration design charette in 2003 to receive input from stakeholders on project priorities,
concerns and constraints, and design ideas.

►

Conducting hydraulic modeling studies to support the development and evaluation of project alternatives.

Initial development and comparative evaluation of four conceptual restoration alternatives in 2004 and 2005.

►

Regulatory agency review of alternative concepts for key issues and regulatory requirements in 2005.

Further refinement and evaluation of the alternatives, and preparation of a Concept Plan Report (July 2006).

PURPOSE AND NEED
The need for the project originates from the environmental degradation that the Upper Truckee River has
historically experienced as a result of human alterations to the river and watershed. The purpose of the proposed
action is to restore natural geomorphic processes and ecological functions in this lowest reach of the Upper
Truckee River and the surrounding marsh to improve ecological values of the study area and help reduce the
river’s discharge of nutrients and sediment that diminish Lake Tahoe’s clarity.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The following basic objectives of the project were developed for the proposed action to meet the purpose and
need:
Objective 1.

Restore natural and self-sustaining river and floodplain processes and functions

Objective 2.

Protect, enhance, and restore naturally functioning habitats

Objective 3.

Restore and enhance fish and wildlife habitat quality

Objective 4.

Improve water quality through enhancement of natural physical and biological processes

Objective 5.

Protect and, where feasible, expand Tahoe yellow cress populations

Objective 6.

Provide public access, access to vistas, and environmental education at the Lower West Side and
Cove East Beach

Objective 7.

Avoid increasing flood hazard on adjacent private property

Objective 8.

Design with sensitivity to the site’s history and cultural heritage

Objective 9.

Design the wetland/urban interface to help provide habitat value and water quality benefits

Objective 10.

Implement a public health and safety program, including mosquito monitoring and control

SUMMARY OF ALTERNATIVES
Four “action” alternatives, and the No Project/No Action Alternative, will be evaluated at an equal level of detail in
the EIR/EIS/EIS. The four action alternatives are illustrated in Exhibits 3 through 6 and are described below. It is
important to note that many of the individual components in each alternative are modular and could be transferred to
other alternatives, or recombined after environmental review to formulate different variations of the alternatives.

All four action alternatives include a recreation and public access component. These ideas are expressed at three
levels of development intensity with respect to recreation-related infrastructure (“maximum”, “minimum”, and
“moderate”). At this point in project planning, there is no necessary connection between the recreation and public
access approach included in a particular alternative and the river restoration strategy of that alternative. The level
of public access and recreational facilities included in the alternative selected for implementation would need to
be compatible with that alternative’s river and marsh restoration strategy.

ALTERNATIVE 1. CHANNEL AGGRADATION AND NARROWING (MAXIMUM RECREATION
INFRASTRUCTURE)
Key elements specific to Alternative 1 include:
►

Raising the bed elevation of the existing channel closer to the existing meadow surface as a means of reestablishing an active floodplain, which would be achieved by placing a series of structures in the channel
designed to alter hydraulics and intentionally cause sediment aggradation of the bed. Local cut and fill would
be used to narrow the channel. Bar development in the aggrading channel would also contribute to channel
narrowing.

►

Creating a sinuous, single thread bankfull channel excavated through the LWS.

►

Using the existing river mouth location, but reducing its capacity by narrowing it with local cut and fill and/or
placement of bioengineered structures to encourage sediment deposition.

►

Reconfiguring two sections of split channel from River Station (RS) 500 to RS 2,600. The low flow channel
would continue to flow through the east branch of the split channel from RS 500 to RS 1,400, but unlike
existing conditions, would continue in the second east branch channel from RS 1,400 to RS 2,600. The west
branches of the split channels would reduce the flow volume and hydraulic stress in the east low-flow channel
by conveying a portion of the high flow.

►

Constructing a bulkhead at the sailing lagoon to cutoff its open connection with the marina and Lake Tahoe
and reconfiguring the relationship between the sailing lagoon and the Upper Truckee River so that the river
controls the hydrology of the lagoon. The new lagoonal system would be analogous to what currently exists
along Trout Creek, but on a larger scale and similar to the Upper Truckee lagoon system prior to the
construction of the Tahoe Keys development. The lagoon would be constructed just west of the Upper
Truckee River. At flow events greater than bankfull, water would overtop the river’s banks and begin to flow
into the lagoon. Local cut and fill would be used to re-contour the topography of the lagoon and decrease its
depth.

►

Constructing a full-service visitor and interpretive center on a Conservancy-owned parcel on high capability
land near the end of Venice Drive and a small self-service visitor and interpretive center along the existing
bike trail near Trout Creek Bridge. The full-service facility would be fully staffed and would likely require a
concessionaire to support its maintenance costs. It could have office space included, for instance, for the
Conservancy or an appropriate non-profit entity to rent. The full-service facility would contain public
restrooms. A new parking lot would be located adjacent to the full-service visitor and interpretive center near
the end of Venice Drive.

►

Developing an interpretive program and installing additional interpretive signage in appropriate locations
throughout the site.

►

Reconfiguring the channel dimensions and raising the streambed due to prompted channel aggradation from
the hydraulic structures, which would decrease channel capacity.

►

Re-routing the trail providing public access to Cove East Beach west of the sailing lagoon on a new levee
parallel to the marina channel. This would allow integration of the sailing lagoon into an Upper Truckee
River-lagoon complex.

►

Enhancing the existing trail alignment providing access to Cove East Beach by constructing a spur trail and
boardwalk to an observation platform near the river mouth. The platform would provide a view across the
river mouth and the meadow and lagoon to the east, as well as out across the lake. The boardwalk railings and
its height above the ground would help keep people off the sandy areas during periods of low lake level.

►

Constructing new trails and boardwalks along the eastern perimeter of the site to help direct and control
existing pedestrian access to Barton Meadow, and in particular to the interior of the site. Wet swales and low
mounds would be used to discourage visitor access to the sensitive areas in the center of the marsh. The
function of boardwalks would be to raise people out of the wetter portions of the site where they currently
walk and damage wetland vegetation.

►

Providing a raised boardwalk connection to the beach. An observation platform would be constructed at the
end of the boardwalk to provide an overlook of the lake, beach, and the wetland, while discouraging entry
onto the beach itself.

►

Providing a raised boardwalk for both pedestrians and cyclists that would cross Trout Creek in the southern
portion of the site, and link to existing bicycle trails at both ends. The boardwalk would allow visitors visual
access into the meadow and to the lake beyond, while minimizing the disturbance that large numbers of hikers
can have on meadow plants.

►

Constructing a Class I bike trail along Venice Drive.

►

Constructing a loop trail for both pedestrian and bicyclists through the wooded area north of Highland
Woods.

►

Constructing a river corridor barrier near the current river alignment to reduce wildlife disturbance.

►

Removing fill behind Harootunian Beach to recreate lagoon and wet meadow conditions.

►

Restoring sand ridges (“dunes”) at Cove East.

ALTERNATIVE 2. NEW CHANNEL – WEST MEADOW (MINIMUM RECREATION INFRASTRUCTURE)
Key elements specific to Alternative 2 include:
►

Excavating a new geomorphic bankfull capacity channel that re-establishes the existing meadow as an active
floodplain. Most of the new channel alignment would be located east of the existing channel. A hydraulic
structure would be constructed in the channel to facilitate the flow transition from the relatively low bed
elevation of the existing incised channel to the higher bed elevation of the new channel.

►

Creating a sinuous, single thread bankfull channel excavated east of the LWS and straightened reach that has
a sinuous planform, bankfull capacity, and active floodplain connection with the existing meadow surface.

►

Constructing a new river mouth with a reduced capacity and higher bed elevation west of the existing
location. This would provide the opportunity for a small area of beach restoration in the existing channel
location. Since this area is prime Tahoe yellow cress habitat, it is anticipated that Tahoe yellow cress would
expand in this beach restoration area.

►

Maintaining a low-flow channel in the same alignment, and providing hydraulic stress relief by excavating
portions of the meadow/terrace separating the split channel branches to create areas for high flow release.

Constructing a bulkhead at the sailing lagoon to cutoff its open connection with the marina and Lake Tahoe
and reconfiguring the relationship between the sailing lagoon and the Upper Truckee River so that the river

along Trout Creek, but on a larger scale and similar to the Upper Truckee River lagoon system prior to the
construction of the Tahoe Keys development. The new lagoon would be constructed just west of the Upper
Truckee River. At flow events greater than bankfull, water would overtop the river’s banks and begin to flow
into the lagoon. There would be no change to the dredged depth of the lagoon.

►

Developing an interpretive program and installing additional interpretive signage in appropriate locations
throughout the site. No new buildings, public restroom facilities, or additional buildings would be
constructed.

►

Reconfiguring the channel dimensions and raising the streambed by encouraging aggradation behind the
hydraulic structures would restore channel capacity.

►

Re-routing the trail providing public access to Cove East Beach to west of the sailing lagoon on a new levee
parallel to the marina channel. This would allow integration of the sailing lagoon into an Upper Truckee
River-lagoon complex.

►

Constructing view points (on-grade or elevated as observation platforms) on the eastern margin of the site at
the end of each of several streets where people currently access the site. The design intent of the view points
would be to discourage pedestrians and their pets from entering the site.

►

Maintaining the location of existing bicycle trails around the perimeter of the study area.

►

Constructing a river corridor barrier near the current river alignment to reduce wildlife disturbance.

►

Removing fill behind Harootunian Beach to recreate lagoon and wet meadow conditions.

►

Restoring sand ridges (“dunes”) at Cove East.

ALTERNATIVE 3. MIDDLE MARSH CORRIDOR (MODERATE RECREATION INFRASTRUCTURE)
Key elements specific to Alternative 3 include:
►

Creating a new geomorphic bankfull capacity pilot channel to connect the river with the existing network of
small channels in the middle of the marsh and re-establish an active floodplain on the existing meadow
surface. A hydraulic structure would be constructed in the existing channel to facilitate the flow transition
from the relatively low bed elevation of the existing incised channel to the higher bed elevation of the pilot

channel and existing meadow channels. No construction would occur within the main meadow’s channel
sections; the river flow paths would be dictated by natural processes.
►

Using the existing river mouth location, but reducing its capacity by narrowing with local cut and fill and
constructing a higher bed elevation with engineered grade controls that simulate the resistant horizontal layers
in the subsurface.

►

In the reach between U.S. 50 and the “Big Bend,” maintaining the low-flow channel in the same alignment,
and provide hydraulic stress relief by excavating portions of the meadow/terrace separating the split channel
branches to create areas for high flow release. Options for additional high flow conveyance under U.S. 50
could include bored overflow conduits.

►

Constructing a bulkhead at the sailing lagoon to cutoff its open connection with the marina and Lake Tahoe
and reconfiguring the relationship between the sailing lagoon and the Upper Truckee River so that the river
controls the hydrology of the lagoon. The new lagoonal system would be analogous to what currently exists
along Trout Creek, but on a larger scale and similar to the Upper Truckee lagoon system prior to the
construction of the Tahoe Keys development. Limited re-contouring would be used to adjust the contours and
edges of the lagoon.

►

Constructing a small self-service visitor and interpretive center just north of the cul-de-sac at the LWS. Public
restrooms would be included as part of the visitor’s center. A new parking lot would be located on a
Conservancy-owned parcel near the end of Venice Drive.

►

Developing an interpretive program and installing additional interpretive signage in appropriate locations
throughout the site.

►

Reconfiguring the channel dimensions and raising the streambed by encouraging aggradation behind the
hydraulic structures would restore channel capacity.

►

Re-routing the trail providing public access to Cove East Beach to west of the sailing lagoon on a new levee
parallel to the marina channel. This would allow integration of the sailing lagoon into an Upper Truckee
River-lagoon complex.

►

Constructing trails and boardwalks along the eastern perimeter of the site to help direct and control the
existing pedestrian access to Barton Meadow, and in particular to the interior of the site. Wet swales and low
mounds would also be used to discourage visitor access to the sensitive areas in the center of the marsh. The
function of boardwalks would be to raise people out of the wetter portions of the site where they currently
walk and damage wetland vegetation.

provided north across the wetland to the beach.

►

Maintaining existing bicycle trails around the perimeter of the study area.

►

Constructing a loop trail for both pedestrians and cyclists through the wooded area north of Highland Woods.

ALTERNATIVE 4. INSET FLOODPLAIN (MODERATE RECREATION INFRASTRUCTURE)
Alternative 4 is fundamentally different from Alternatives 1 through 3 in that the existing streambed elevation
would not be raised and no new channels would be excavated into the existing meadow/terrace surface. Key
elements specific to Alternative 4 include:
►

Excavating portions of the meadow surface along the corridor of the existing channel to create an inset
floodplain that would increase active floodplain area and flood storage for small magnitude events.

►

Using local cut and fill to reduce the width and capacity of the existing channel.

►

Creating a sinuous, single thread bankfull channel constructed along a similar alignment as the straightened
reach using local cut and fill.

►

Using the existing river mouth location, but reducing its capacity by narrowing it with local cut and fill.

►

Maintaining the low-flow channel in the same alignment, and providing hydraulic stress relief by excavating
portions of the meadow/terrace separating the split channel branches to create areas for high flow release.

►

Retaining the open connection between the sailing lagoon, the marina, and Lake Tahoe.

►

Constructing a small self-service visitor and interpretive center just north of the cul-de-sac at the LWS. Public
restrooms would be included as part of the visitor’s center. A new parking lot would be located on a
Conservancy-owned parcel near the end of Venice Drive.

►

Developing an interpretive program and installing additional interpretive signage in appropriate locations
throughout the site.

►

Constructing trails and boardwalks along the eastern perimeter of the site to help direct and control existing
pedestrian access to Barton Meadow, and in particular to the interior of the site. Wet swales and low mounds
would also be used to discourage visitor access to the sensitive areas in the center of the marsh. The function
of boardwalks would be to raise people out of the wetter portions of the site where they currently walk and
damage wetland vegetation.

ALTERNATIVE 5. NO PROJECT/NO ACTION
Under Alternative 5, no changes to the river or marsh would be implemented and existing conditions in the study
area would be projected into the future.

POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS
The following subject areas include potential environmental effects associated with the range of alternatives
identified above. These issues will be explored further during project scoping and during preparation of the draft
EIR/EIS:
Land Use. Land use impacts to be addressed in the EIR/EIS/EIS include changes to onsite uses, land use
compatibility, and community character. The EIR/EIS/EIS will also address consistency with the TRPA plan area
statement (PAS) requirements (PAS 100 and 102).
Hydrology, Geomorphology, and Water Quality. Alternatives 1-4 would restore a portion of the Upper Truckee
River with the intent to improve long-term water quality in the river and Lake Tahoe by reducing the reach’s
contribution of nutrients and suspended sediment to the river. Implementation of Alternatives 1-4 could create a
risk that short-term increases in sediment load during the construction period. Best Management Practices and
mitigation measures would be developed to address potential short-term impacts to water quality that are
identified in the EIR/EIS/EIS. Restoration of the river channel would change the hydrologic and geomorphic
processes of the river. The hydrologic analysis will focus primarily on assessing changes to flow patterns as
related to changes in channel form and function, support of restoration objectives, and avoidance of any increase
in flood hazard to developed land uses adjacent to the river. The geomorphic assessment will focus on potential
short- and long-term changes in sediment fate and transport and landscape-scale factors. The EIR/EIS/EIS will
also address long-term water quality monitoring needs.
Biological Resources (Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Vegetation and Wildlife). Alternatives 1-4 include
actions for enhancing or restoring native vegetation communities, protecting sensitive wildlife habitat areas from

October 2006

excessive public use, and enhancing terrestrial and aquatic habitat values. These actions would affect the
distribution, extent, and quality of sensitive and common biological resources on the project site. Each alternative
was designed to result in long-term benefits to biological resources; however, construction of Alternatives 1-4
would remove or disturb terrestrial and aquatic habitats in some locations. Each alternative would result in
changes in existing public access to and recreational uses of the project site, which would influence future patterns
of disturbance on biological resources. The EIR/EIS/EIS will evaluate the potential indirect, direct, and
cumulative effects of each alternative on: 1) existing vegetation communities, wildlife habitats, and aquatic
resources; 2) common and ecologically significant vegetation, wildlife, and aquatic resources; and 3) specialstatus plant, wildlife, and aquatic species, including TRPA Special Interest Species. The relationship of project
effects to TRPA thresholds for vegetation, wildlife, and fisheries will be evaluated.
Earth Resources: Geology and Soils, and Land Capability and Coverage. Alternatives 1-4 would involve
grading and excavating for reconfiguration of a portion of the Upper Truckee River and changing site topography
for restoration purposes, including filling portions of the existing, degraded channel. The EIR/EIS/EIS will
describe potential environmental effects related to land capability and coverage, soils and geology, topographic
alteration, seismic hazards, slope stability, and erosion potential. If soil export outside of the study area is
necessary, potential disposal sites will be identified and evaluated.
Scenic Resources. Alternatives 1-4 would result in the changes to natural elements that contribute to the scenic
quality of the study area (e.g., river channel, river mouth, lagoon, vegetation), as well as changes related to the
installation of recreation-related structures (e.g., trails, boardwalks, viewing points, visitor center). Visibility of
these changes from the appropriate shoreline travel route on the lake and from U.S. 50, a TRPA-designated scenic
travel route, will be determined. Potential impacts from construction and operation of the alternatives will be
evaluated from sensitive viewpoints in or near the study area. Scenic effects will be evaluated in terms of
visibility of the alternatives, alteration of the visual setting, sensitivity of viewpoints, and potential effects on
TRPA scenic thresholds.
Public Access and Recreation. Construction and operation of Alternatives 1-4 would result in changes in existing
public access to and recreational uses of the study area. The study area is surrounded by residential neighborhoods
of South Lake Tahoe. PAS 102 on west side of the study area includes a priority for public access to the lake at
Cove East Beach. PAS 100, which occupies the center and east side of the study area, emphasizes resources
conservation. The location of a boat take-out site on the river differs among the alternatives, so impacts to
paddling use of the river will be evaluated. The EIR/EIS/EIS will evaluate the changes to existing recreation areas
and uses, the change to TRPA persons-at-one-time (PAOTs) allocations in the project area, the effect on TRPA
recreation thresholds, trail connectivity, and river access and crossings.

Cultural Resources. The study area is located on undeveloped land. The EIR/EIS/EIS will analyze the potential
for cultural resources to be located on or near the site and the potential for disturbance of known and/or
undiscovered cultural resources due to implementation of the proposed alternatives. Also, the proposed action
includes consideration of Native American cultural uses of the study area and how restoration can be compatible
with and support those uses. The EIR/EIS/EIS process will include consultation with the Washoe Tribe and
evaluation in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.
Transportation, Parking and Circulation. Alternatives 1-4 would generate short-term, construction-related
traffic. Long-term traffic generated by the recreational components will also be discussed. The transportation
analysis will include identification of major roadways that may be affected by the proposed alternatives, traffic
volumes on those roadways, overall operating conditions, public transit routes that may be affected by the
proposed alternatives, and major pedestrian or bicycle routes that may be affected by the proposed alternatives.
Air Quality. Alternatives 1-4 would involve construction emissions and generation of fugitive dust, as well as
generate construction traffic in the area, contributing pollutants to the air basin. The EIR/EIS/EIS will include an
assessment of short-term (i.e., construction) air quality impacts and long-term (i.e., operational) regional air
pollutant emissions, including mobile, stationary, and area source emissions.
Noise. The EIR/EIS/EIS will assess potential short-term (i.e., construction) noise impacts, relative to sensitive
receptors and their potential exposure. Noise levels of specific construction equipment will be determined and
resultant noise levels at nearby receptors (at given distances from the source) will be calculated. Long-term (i.e.,
operational) noise impacts, including increased noise from mobile, stationary, and area sources, will be assessed.
Public Services and Utilities. The public services and utilities section of the EIR/EIS/EIS will evaluate impacts
on power, water treatment and distribution, wastewater collection, solid waste collection and disposal, police
services, fire protection services, schools, and fire fuel management.
Hazards and Hazardous Materials. The EIR/EIS/EIS will assess whether potential hazardous materials may be
located in the study area. The EIR/EIS/EIS will also address hazardous materials issues related to adjoining
properties.
Agricultural and Mineral Resources. The proposed alternatives are not expected to affect agricultural or mineral
resources in the study area. Existing resources will be verified and discussed in the EIR/EIS/EIS.
Socioeconomics. With the exception of recreation, discussed above, the proposed alternatives are not expected to
significantly affect socioeconomic factors associated with the study area. The EIR/EIS/EIS will consider potential
economic impacts related to implementation of the proposed alternatives.

Growth Inducement. The effects of the proposed alternatives on growth inducement will be addressed in the
EIR/EIS/EIS; however, the proposed alternatives are not expected to induce or result in the growth of population
in the region, cause an increase in demand for employment opportunities, or cause an increase in other public
needs.
Cumulative Effects. The EIR/EIS/EIS will identify and describe recently approved and reasonably anticipated
non-river related projects in the South Lake Tahoe area and vicinity of the Upper Truckee Marsh, other river
restoration projects being contemplated for upstream reaches of the Upper Truckee River, and region-wide
planning efforts currently underway (e.g., Pathway 2007, the total maximum daily load [TMDL] requirement
being developed for the Upper Truckee River). The EIR/EIS/EIS will evaluate the combined effects of these
activities with the proposed action.
TRPA Threshold Carrying Capacities: The EIR/EIS/EIS will include assessment of the proposed action’s
compliance with and contribution to the attainment of threshold carrying capacities adopted by TRPA.

INTENDED USES OF THE EIR/EIS/EIS
The Conservancy, Reclamation, and TRPA will use this EIR/EIS/EIS to consider the environmental effects,
mitigation measures, and alternatives, when reviewing the proposed action for approval. The EIR/EIS/EIS will
serve as the State’s CEQA compliance document, as Reclamation’s NEPA compliance document, and as TRPA’s
compliance document with respect to its Compact and Chapter 5 of the TRPA Code of Ordinances. State
responsible and trustee agencies and federal cooperating agencies may also use this EIR/EIS/EIS, as needed, for
subsequent discretionary actions.

PUBLIC SCOPING
Public scoping meetings are being conducted to provide you with the opportunity to learn more about the
proposed action and to express oral comments about the content of the EIR/EIS/EIS, in addition to your
opportunity to submit written comments. The scoping meetings will be held at the following times and locations:

TRUCKEE UPDATE

UPPER TRUCKEE RIVER AND
MARSH RESTORATION PROJECT

This newsletter is the second in a series of periodic
issues that will guide you through the *California
Tahoe Conservancy’s process of restoring the
Upper Truckee Marsh, one of the largest wetlands
remaining in the Sierra Nevada Range.

The Conservancy hopes this outreach effort will
keep you informed so you are better able to provide
input and participate in this restoration project with
us. The success of this project will be enhanced
by your contributions.

Project Objectives:
¾
¾

The Upper Truckee River has been severely
impacted by human development. The river was
put in a ditch to allow for construction of the Tahoe
Keys. This has resulted in an eroding river, lowered
groundwater and a dry, non-functional meadow.

¾

The Conservancy will begin the environmental
review process to restore the river with the first of
several public meetings (see back page for dates,
time and location). The project objectives (listed in
the box to the right) will guide you through the
proposed alternatives for river restoration.

The Tahoe Basin contains a rich diversity of fish,
wildlife, and native plants. Flycatchers, warblers,
mallards, and other waterfowl feed in the basin's
marshes and meadows. Ospreys nest on lakeside
snags; bald eagles roost in winter forest. Rainbow,
brook, and brown trout dart about in the basin's
streams. Hundreds of brick-red kokanee salmon run
up Taylor Creek to spawn, and huge Mackinaw swim
in the depths of Lake Tahoe itself.

Through its land acquisition, planning, site improvement, and management activities, the California Tahoe Conservancy plays a major role in the basinwide effort to restore and sustain the equilibrium
between the natural and the human environment and between public and private uses at Lake Tahoe.

DRAFT RESTORATION ALTERNATIVES
The Upper Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project team
has assembled a set of four draft alternatives for the
restoration of the Upper Truckee River and Marsh. These
alternatives draw on years of work by the Conservancy in
developing an understanding of the site, on recent compilation
of existing information regarding the physical and ecological
processes at work on the site, the results of the restoration
design session held in June 2003 and numerous meetings with
members of the public.
The Upper Truckee Marsh is located along the south shore of
Lake Tahoe. The study area is approximately 592 acres and
includes parcels owned by the California Tahoe Conservancy
and other public and private entities. The study area includes
the mouths of Trout Creek and the Upper Truckee River,
wetland and upland habitats, and a restored wetland area
known as Lower West Side. The Lower West Side project site
is located in the 24-acre Cove East, the western portion of the
study area, just east of Tahoe Keys Marina. This area was the
first component of the Upper Truckee River and Marsh
Restoration Project to be implemented. During the summers
of 2001 and 2002, approximately 11 acres of former wetland,
which was filled during Tahoe Keys construction, was
excavated and wetland restoration was initiated.
Among the considerations that guided the process of
assembling these alternatives were the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Each alternative is conceived of as a “full-spectrum”
alternative; each is intended to address, to varying degrees,
all project objectives.
Many of the individual concepts shown in each alternative
are modular and could be transferred to other alternatives.
Draft alternatives were assembled to embody a diverse
range of concepts for particular components of the plan.
Each alternative is intended to be a feasible alternative that
the Conservancy could realistically construct.
Alternatives were developed within the bounds set by the
various critical constraints identified and mapped earlier in
the planning process.

Common Elements
C

Each of the four alternatives has common river restoration
elements. These include: 1) reestablishing an active floodplain
connection for the river, 2) replacement of the straightened
channel adjacent to the Lower West Side with a new, sinuous
channel with a bankfull capacity, 3) reducing the size of the
river mouth to limit backwater effects from Lake Tahoe, and
4) the development of treatments to control the accelerated
bank erosion downstream of the bridge. Three of the four
alternatives also propose re-establishing a river-overflow
lagoon at Cove East.

•

•

Alternative 3 - Create a new channel in the middle of the
marsh. A new channel would be excavated to connect the
remnant channels in the middle of the marsh to the Lower
West Side. Two channels would be constructed through
the Lower West Side, with the west channel flowing into
and out of a redesigned lagoon (“Sailing Lagoon”) west of
the river mouth.
Alternative 4 - Different from the other alternatives in that
the existing meadow surface would not be reestablished as
the active floodplain. Instead, portions of the meadow
surface would be excavated along the corridor of the
existing channel to create an inset floodplain.
Alternative 5 – No project / No action

Reestablish an Active Floodplain

New Sinuous Channel in Straightened Reach

The overall objective of river restoration in all four
alternatives is to decrease channel capacity and reestablish the
channel’s connection to an active floodplain. This will
increase the frequency and duration of overbank flows and
allow the deposition of suspended sediment onto the meadow.
These restored river processes will enhance plant
communities, aquatic and terrestrial habitat, water quality, and
the ecological value of the site.

The incision and excess capacity of the straightened channel
have converted the meadow from an active floodplain to an
area that is infrequently inundated. The straightened channel
also has poor diversity of flow velocity and often lacks
sufficient suitable habitat to support healthy aquatic life. All
four alternatives replace the existing straightened reach near
the LWS with a new channel that has a sinuous planform,
bankfull capacity, and active floodplain connection with the
existing meadow surface. The alternatives mostly differ in
their alignment of the new channel. The key restoration
actions for each alternative are:

The Upper Truckee River between the Highway 50 Bridge and
the straightened reach is incised and over-widened. Because
of this channel degradation, the river can convey, on average,
800 to 1,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) in the channel before
water begins to overtop the banks and flow out onto the
meadow. A reduction in channel capacity would increase the
frequency of overbank flow, resulting in a beneficial increase
in local groundwater levels and deposition of suspended
sediment on the floodplain. Deposition removes the
microscopic sediment particles that diminish lake clarity and
allows nutrients, such as phosphorous and nitrogen, to be
utilized by the wetland plants that are then in turn used by
wildlife. All four alternatives propose actions for reducing the
channel capacity and reestablishing an active floodplain.
Each alternative replaces the existing straightened channel by
reducing the width of the channel and decreasing the distance
between the channel’s streambed and floodplain surface.
These objectives are accomplished differently in each
alternative.
•
•

Alternative 1 - Raise the bottom of the stream in the
existing channel closer to the existing meadow surface.
Alternative 2 – Excavate a new channel that flows out of its
banks every other year or so and reestablishes the existing
meadow as a naturally functioning floodplain. Most of the
new channel alignment would be located east of the
existing channel

•
•
•
•

Alternative 1 – Construct a single channel through
the Lower West Side.
Alternative 2 – Construct a channel east of the LWS
and straightened reach.
Alternative 3 – Construct two smaller and shallower
channels that overflow frequently to the east and
through the Lower West Side.
Alternative 4 – Construct a single channel that flows

out of the stream bank every 2.5 years along a similar
alignment as the straightened reach using local cut and fill.

Recreation and Access
Overlain on the four river restoration concepts shown in the
alternative plans are a range of ideas for managing public
access to and recreational use of the site. These ideas are
expressed at three levels of intensity of development of
recreation-related infrastructure:
• Alternative 1 displays a potential “maximum” level
of infrastructure development
• Alternative 2 shows a “minimum” level of
infrastructure development
• Alternatives 3 and 4 offer two variations of a
“moderate” level, with infrastructure development
falling between the two extremes

In most cases, there is no necessary connection between the
recreation and public access approach included in a particular
alternative and the river restoration ideas in that alternative.
Many of the recreation and access elements, and the different
intensities of infrastructure development could be
implemented with any of the four river restoration ideas. All
ideas for recreation infrastructure development were
conceived within the context of existing land use regulations
and Conservancy purposes in acquiring the property. Land
east of the existing alignment of the Upper Truckee River is to
be used as wildlife habitat, and even the maximum recreation
alternative recognizes this. However, visitors are currently
accessing this area and any future plan must contain
provisions to direct and manage existing use. Cove East Beach
and adjacent lands west of the current river alignment are
presently much more heavily used by the public, and this use
would continue in any future restoration scenario.

Getting Involved
The planning process provides two key opportunities for the
public to become involved in the development of the project.
Public "scoping" takes place at the beginning of the process
when the planning effort is announced. During scoping the
public is asked to raise questions and concerns to help the
design team identify the major issues to be addressed in the
environmental review document. With the release of the draft
document the public is provided the opportunity to examine
the project alternatives and present comments. The comments
are then analyzed and may be used to revise portions of the
draft document and guide the development of the preferred
alternative.

Truckee planning process, to view maps of the alternatives,

River has historically experienced as a result of
human alterations to the river and watershed.
The purpose of the proposed action is to restore
natural geomorphic processes and ecological
functions in this lowest reach of the Upper Truckee
River and the surrounding marsh to improve
ecological values of the study area and help reduce
the river’s discharge of nutrients and sediment that
diminish Lake Tahoe’s clarity.

Recreation/Public Access
Recreational/public access components are
‘modular’ and could be transferred between
alternatives, or recombined after environmental
review to formulate different variations of the
alternatives.
The level of public access and recreational facilities
included in the alternative selected for
implementation would need to be compatible with
that alternative’s river and marsh restoration
strategy.

Description of Major Points, Decisions or Actions:
Encouraged recreation.

What about the Tahoe Keys Corporation yard?
Rick: The Tahoe Keys Property Owners Association (TKPOA) has a 99
year lease for the yard. Restoration would involve cooperation of
TKPOA. Discussions are in the works.
Supports relocating corporation yard. Complaints from public to
RWQCB. Encourages Rick to work with TKPOA to find new location.

Lauri Kemper
Rick Robinson
Lauri Kemper

Shane Romsos,
TRPA

Rick: Actively looking for new location for corporation yard.
Encourages TRPA to find a better site for corporation yard.
Lahontan staff is involved in the project.
Lahontan staff is involved in design of restoration, quantitative load
reductions. Hoping EIS will discuss quantification of impacts/changes
during construction, turbidity. Need a certain level of detail.
Looking forward to Lahontan staff involvement
The project should consider: Non-native species issues related to the
lagoon and other areas. Also, coordination with other projects [on UTR].
Rick: Coordinating with other agencies working on other reaches.
Feasibility of reconnecting water supply to Pope Marsh?
Rick: Would require an active pumping system, probably not feasible to
reconnect. TKPOA has looked into this to some degree. Maintenance of
such a system = high cost. Not part of this project.
Encourage potential for building this into alternatives to help Pope
Marsh.
Environmental document should consider bald eagle thresholds.

Description of Major Points, Decisions or Actions:
Oxbows near airport. Asks about current UTM diagrams.
Rick: Conceptual/representative graphics – schematics for the
environmental process.
EIR/EIS/EIS including flooding projections?
Rick: Yes, including WQ benefits and existing housing in 100 year
floodplain. Mentioned flooding objective.
Hurricane Katrina actually resulted in some benefits to wetlands.
Rick: Breaches in levees can benefit wetland systems, lead to sediment
accumulation. Flat areas in systems collect sediment. Currently: No
sediment collection.

Shane Romsos
Virginia
Mahacek

Hoping for modeling of existing deposition and change due to project
Chapter 5 of the watershed assessment identifies this area as an
ecologically significant threshold marsh system.
Shane asked about Pope Marsh. Discusses in the Process & Functions
study [for the UTM], difficult to reconnect. Pope Marsh is groundwater
supported. New studies would be needed for Pope.
Lauri mentioned evaluation of WQ performance. Dependent on
Concepts modeling timing, including simulation of No Project/No
Action. Concepts modeling may provide info for alternatives; may not.
The Marsh is difficult to model.
Alan mentioned the airport reach and sinuosity. The valley [where the
airport reach is located] seems flat but the Marsh is the flattest spot. Near
the airport: an alluvial valley stream reach. The Marsh is a transition
area; marsh/delta area. Difficult to model behavior in this reach.
Somewhat represented by single-channel modeling but not exactly.
Current UTM graphics: Actual channel will not be highly sinuous.

Alan Tolhurst

Lauri Kemper

When you engineer changes in the stream, the stream will take its own
course at that point?
Virginia: Yes. Alt 1 nudges the stream. Alt 2, construction/future
dynamics. Alt 3, facilitating the channel taking over marsh. Different
levels of predictability and long-term needs. We will model. But
modeling has limitations. Need to consider natural dynamics. The barrier
beach is part of the process and design.
Benefit of Alt 3 = using the naturally functioning marsh there today.
Well protected due to less disturbance. More concerned about
alternatives [that place the channel] at the edge [of the site].
Virginia: It’s a trade off: Predictability and engineering.

Description of Major Points, Decisions or Actions:
Things have to happen in the next few years. Boardwalks – design
implications?
Virginia: We’ll need to investigate how realistic some changes are
(boardwalking, boat takeout locations).
Public Comments
Great project. The environmental benefits should be outstanding.
The Sierra Club’s mission is to explore, enjoy and protect natural
resources. Major mission: enjoyment participating in recreation, public
outings. Encourage creating a system where the public can enjoy the
area, not create rogue trails that will destroy source.
Looking at public process and public access. Should look at what’s good
for local access but this is also a national resource. Public access may be
limited to serve environmental benefits.

Description of Major Points, Decisions or Actions:
Board Comment
Expressed surprise at the inclusion of recreation since the purpose of the
project is to restore water quality.
Rick: Trails to be on the periphery of the site. Mentions the presence of
special-status plants and that recreation management is necessary for
success of restoration project.
Which alternative is going to have the most immediate and maximum
effect on (improving) water quality? Will each alternative have the same
impacts?
Rick: They will have a range of benefits and impacts.
Commends CTC for having the alternatives and studying their impacts to
choose the preferred alternatives.
Requests study of:
Total nutrient load and total solids load compared to No Project.
Until you know the net effects of changing the channel configuration – is
there any merit to the idea of delaying the recreational improvements
until you know the impact of what the recreational impacts would be?
Rick: Doing it separately would be more costly.
There might be some variables that are unanticipated in regards to the
impact of recreation.

Kim Bettis,

Recommends that there be an educational component to the recreational
portion of the project.


Jim Galloway

Mentions failure of Rosewood Creek.
Asks that there be consideration for the amount of disturbance required
to implement each alternative. Make sure the disturbance does not
outweigh the gain (in regards to construction).

Public Comment
Please overlay streets on the web maps so people can get more easily
oriented.
How will this affect the meadow south of the bridge?
A: Rick indicated that this project would not directly address the issues
of the meadow south of the bridge, because it is outside the
Conservancy’s property. One of the alternatives will consider increasing
the capacity of culverts under U. S. 50, so there may be an indirect
influence. This will be studied in the environmental document.

Each of the alternatives need to show high water lines for flood analysis.
Potential for flood hazard is an important issue for the City.
A: Virginia summarized the modeling to be conducted, including the
100-year event.
How far upstream is the river incised? He heard it extends to the airport.
A: The U. S. 50 bridge provides a grade control. Incision and widening
problems occur in different reaches well upstream of the marsh, all the
way up to the golf course.
A suggestion would be to investigate the energy of flows up and down
the river to assess the potential for upstream and downstream impacts.
Would the Conservancy acquire property where the meadow would be
flooded?
A: The Conservancy is not proposing to increase flood hazard such that
private properties would experience increased flooding, so there would
be no damage. New property acquisition is not proposed.
Where is the split channel that will be restored? The banks of Trout
Creek fall into the stream. Will there be future plans for restoration of
Trout Creek?
A: The split channel is immediately downstream of U.S. 50. Regarding
Trout Creek, the section of the stream downstream of U.S. 50 is part of
the project study area. The creek is relatively stable, so substantial direct
restoration needs are not anticipated at this time. However, a Resource
Management Plan will be prepared as part of the project that would
include specific actions to manage the site’s natural resources, such as
resources of Trout Creek, including site specific restoration, if conditions
warrant.
The concept of flooding the meadow has been known for some time and
there are concerns by the neighbors that there has not been much notice,
and there may be walkways throughout the site. Is the public sufficiently
aware? Meeting the minimum requirements isn’t effective sometimes.
He suggests a posted sign at the access points of the property.
Can we schedule a briefing to the City Council?
A: Yes, we can do that and present the alternative.
Will there be an opportunity in spring and summer to provide input?
How will the recreation facilities and site maintenance be maintained?
Who will be responsible?
A: The Conservancy will be responsible and will use stat
What is the official name of the marsh? Is this the same place where
“Clean Tahoe” comes to help with maintenance?
A: Yes, the Conservancy does now contract with “Clean Tahoe” to help
with trash pick-up.

We were not notified in the Highlands Woods neighborhood. She
supports the restoration of the meadows, but is concerned and disturbed
about laying walkways in the meadow that would increase recreation
access.
A: The alternatives have a range of recreation levels and the
environmental document will address impacts to the neighbors. The
natural sensitivities will also be carefully studied.
The mailout approach did not work for this meeting. The mail list must
be flawed.
He suggested using an email distribution approach to get word out to the
neighbors.
When the water from an incised channel comes in from upsteam, where
would it break out of the channel for flooding the meadow? Does the
U.S. 50 bridge cause problems upstream? John supported filling in the
old channel and building a new channel of the appropriate size and
design.
John remarks that the method of restoration proposed under Alternative
4 is not as supported by research as much as the restoration methods
proposed for the other alternatives.

Unknown

A: Virginia provided a summary of the overbanking concepts and how
the designs would avoid flood hazard to developed properties.
Will there be enough water from upstream to overbank at this location,
considering other restoration projects farther up the river (i.e., with
upstream projects taking water out of the river, too).

Ron Rettus

A: The environmental document will examine this in the cumulative
analysis.
Is there something in the modeling that says the flooding will not get any
worse? Will we look at the creek that comes into the river from the side,
near Colorado Court, to be sure we do not worsen the flooding hazard?

Dawn
Armstrong

A: The study will look at both the regulatory floodplain and flooding
based on existing physical conditions. The Conservancy surveyed high
water marks in the 1997 flood to help validate the models.
Will the meadow be wetter so people will not be out in the meadow
much anyway?
A: Rick summarized the recreation approach for the recreation and
access facilities to be focused on the west side of the river (Cove East)
and generally to protect the interior of the main marsh meadow.

Harootunian

Bill Ottman

The willows and lodgepole pine are reestablishing on the site already,
since the cattle has been removed, and there may be very dense willow
in spots, like behind Carrows. This will interfere with access.
A: The Conservancy has been considering the future vegetation
conditions for a long time. The environmental document will consider
ways to manage the resources and support native vegetation. Willows
along the river may be very thick.
He is concerned about recreation and would like to have more raised
trails on the project site. He is concerned recreation is being pushed into
the background.
A: Rick summarized his discussion with the Park and Recreation
Commission, including consideration of a bicycle trail along the beach
and whether this is feasible or not.

Public Comment
I have seen a severe amount of down cutting by the river. Which
alternative brings the bed back up?
A: Rick answered that all alternatives are designed to reconnect the river
with its floodplain. Three alternatives would explore different
alternatives to raise the river up to the floodplain. One alternative would
lower the elevation of land along the river corridor to create an inset
floodplain.
What is the sailing lagoon’s function now and what do we have in mind?
Wasn’t it just dredged out?

A: A 1930 aerial photograph shows a lagoon where the sailing lagoon is
located, but it is not clear how much modification had occurred.
John observed very high water coming down Trout Creek this last year.
Jerome is a member of the Parks and Recreation Commission. This is a
tremendously important project and it needs to receive as much
importance as any project on the South Shore. There appears to be four
themes: stream restoration and protection of sensitive areas are two
where the Conservancy has done very well. Controlled and intelligent
recreation and long-term site management are another two themes, and
the Conservancy does not have as much experience in these. The City
wants to have a boardwalk behind the beach and will push for that
feature. We need to deal with these issues with great detail and
attention.
Does the project involve restoration of Trout Creek?
A: We are looking at the whole site, but we are not proposing to do too
much on Trout Creek because it is in relatively good shape.
She would like to see the best possible restoration of all the public land,
including habitat and water quality function.
The City is interested in a bicycle path crossing directly along the beach
crossing the mouths of Trout Creek and the Upper Truckee River.
A: This was not in our original set of alternatives, because of regulatory
restrictions related to the sensitive resources of the site, including Tahoe
yellow cress, bald eagle, and waterfowl. Also, the hydrological
dynamics would make the construction difficult to avoid flood flows and
cope with changing beach conditions.
She helps keeps the meadow clean, and has a dog that she cleans up
after. Will dogs be excluded from the marsh? Are there too many
people out there now? Can cross-country skiing be harmful?
A: The capacity of the site is an important question and sometimes
public use is harmful. Sensitive resources have been lost in the past, but
informed and respectful use can be compatible with the natural
resources. We hope a balance can be achieved.
Sensitive places are not allowed to be walked upon directly and
boardwalks are the way they are protected.
An elevated boardwalk, above the habitat on the ground and above the
flood, could control public access and direct it to less sensitive locations.
This should be examined.
Are there no cost constraints on what is designed?
A: Yes, cost will be considered. The EIR will not incorporated costs, but
the Conservancy’s consideration of a preferred alternative will consider
cost.
The cost to the lake is what is of greatest concern.

Eric Larson

Will the inset floodplain limit the area within which the river may
meander? The interest is to recreate the most natural conditions as
possible. Maintain natural conditions in the center, and restrict the
public use to the edges.
A: Yes, but it will meander within a larger floodplain area than it does
now.
Were the alternatives informed by upstream disturbance? Have we
considered the conditions of the river upstream.
A: The work has considered watershed conditions, but is not proposing
changes to the river upstream of the U. S. 50 bridge. The bridge
provides a significant constriction of flow. We will look at cumulative
effects of projects upstream in the watershed. Sediment transport
estimates will consider upstream restoration projects. Other influences,
like tree removal and the resulting changes in transportation rates, will
be considered, as well.

As a full time resident of the Al Tahoe community (866 Stanford Av), I would not want to see The
Meadow turned into a tourist attraction. Although there are ample Vacation Rentals in the area, Al
Tahoe is a family oriented neighborhood with children playing and folks walking the streets and the

our yards and driveways. Please leave The Meadow to it's natural beauty and peace.

SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, CA 96150
WE ARE HOME OWNERS ADJACENT TO THE MEADOW AND WORK IN THE COMMUNITY.
MIKE ELAM,

Thanks for allowing us the opportunity to comment on the scope of work proposed for the South
Upper Truckee. What follows is our list of concerns and suggestions:
- It is our opinion that the river's current flow pattern is meandering and sinuous and relatively
natural, therefore it should be left fundamentally undisturbed without additional human tampering
and engineering.
- Some minimal recreational additions would be helpful, in order to minimize the impact of human
activity, such as boardwalks, and/or foot and bike trails. However, as the area is so close to the
lake, an improved recreational infrastructure would most likely bring more human use and therefore
impact.
- Our other concern is our property. If the river is redesigned to flood onto our property with
increased regularity, which appears to be the intent, then what, if any, protective measures are
proposed by TRPA or CTC for the Tahoe Island Subdivision.
Thanks.

Dear Mrs. Grandfield - As an owner of one of the 3 parcels of privately owned land involved in this
Truckee marsh issue, I would like to know why I wasn't notified about anything. There is no one
authorized to speak for me, and as I just found out yesterday, I didn't make todays deadline to
voice my concerns. Please respond at your earliest convenience. Thank you.

Hi Jacqui,
My husband is dropping off a copy of this letter to your office today along with a map of some ideas
for the Upper Truckee Marsh project. I wanted to send this also via email just in case the hard
copy doesnt get to you today, considering it must be received today (April 30th).
Thanks for considering our ideas!

Proposed meadow changes
Dear Tahoe Conservancy,
I was recently disturbed to find that there are proposed changes in the
works for the Upper Truckee meadow. I have lived in Tahoe since I was
a baby and have always loved living with nature. Few would disagree
that Tahoe is one of the most beautiful places on earth and the Upper
Truckee meadow is one of Tahoe's gems. Unfortunately, the dynamics in
Tahoe seem to be changing. Tahoe is well on its way to becoming a
"look, but don't touch" landmark. I fear that before long, locals will
not have access to enjoy the wonders that make up Tahoe, unless they
can afford to buy a multi-million dollar home with private access to
our meadows, streams and beaches or else rent a condo from our
Vale-like Heavenly Village.
I have enjoyed the Upper Truckee meadow for most of my life. After
college, I moved into the Al Tahoe neighborhood so that I might have
access to take my dogs on a nature walk where we can enjoy all the

spectacular wildlife this meadow attracts. Along with my fellow
neighbors, I help pick up after careless tourists and maintain the
meadow's natural state. As a dog behaviorist and trainer, I seek to
educate people about the importance of being responsible, picking up
after their pets and how to enjoy nature without being harmful. I walk
down to the beach with my dogs almost everyday, where my dogs can romp
in the lake without disturbing anything. Being there nearly everyday
means that I can help to keep an eye on our valuable resource and be
alert for any potential problems.
Please don't change this beautiful meadow. We locals care for it very
deeply. It is the main reason I live in this area. The Ledbedders
sold the land with good intentions that it might be a haven for the
neighbors who so enjoy it. Walk ways and viewing areas would only
serve to drive away locals and attract more visitors, who do not care
about the long term effects of their visit. Please don't turn one more
jewel of Tahoe into a tourist-only attraction.
Your concerned citizen,
-Tammy Cowen________________________________________________________________________

The Meadow
As a full time resident of the Al Tahoe community (866 Stanford) I request that The Meadow be left
as a place of natural beauty and peace. Although ample Vacation Rentals are sprinkled about, Al
Tahoe is family oriented with children playing and many people walking the streets and Meadow.
We do not need speeding, lost tourists endangering the population and parking in our driveways
and yards. Please keep The Meadow natural, and available to the locals who have been The
Meadows caretaker for years---we pick up after ourselves and only leave our footprints.

Upper Truckee Wetlands Project

Dear Conservancy and TRPA,
I understand a decision is being made tomorrow regarding the fate of
the Upper Truckee wetlands. A few of the neighbors in the area received
a document listing the changes proposed to the meadow.

I have lived in the Al Tahoe neighborhood for 10 years but have gone
to the meadow daily for almost 20 years. In fact, I moved to this
neighborhood for the express purpose of living near the meadow. I walk
my dogs there from the Sacramento side all the way to the beach, and
along the shore of the lake to the mouth of the Truckee. As we walk, I
clean up garbage (including my LEASHED dogs' waste), ask others to
clean up after themselves, and generally act as a steward of the
meadow. I love sitting at the beach watching the birds, the lake and
the animals there. Several times I have called the police to report
various troubles from fires to parties to snow mobiles zooming around.
Your plan of walkways, vistas, and closed access to the beach invites
trouble. Law abiding citizens will be banned from the beaches, your
eyes and ears in the neighborhood will be closed, and you will increase
traffic on our dilapidated streets. Please leave the meadow alone. It
is beautiful as it is. Do not restrict access to the locals. We love
the meadow and take care of it daily....we are your eyes and ears.
Please respect the intent of the Ledbetters in selling the land to
you....they wanted the local neighbors to have access just as we did
when they owned it. PLEASE LEAVE THE MEADOW AS IT IS and spend your
monies on buying more land to stave off the incredible building going
on. You money is better spent in that way.
Sincerely,
Cindy Cowen

Upper Truckee River Wetlands
I have lived near the corner of Sonoma and El Dorado Avenues for almost 20 years. And for even
longer than that, I have enjoyed year-round recreational activities in the Upper Truckee River
Wetlands, aka the meadow. Daily, I walk the dog (yes, on a leash and, yes, I clean up after her),
sometimes I walk with friends, sometimes I hang out at the beach, and in the winter, I cross country
ski. There are very few days in the year that I don’t make it out to the meadow.

My neighbors and I like to think of ourselves as stewards of this meadow. We call authorities when
inappropriate behaviors occur (like snowmobiles zooming around, for example). We pick up other
people’s trash. We take great pride in its beauty, whether it be full of wildflowers or a new foot of
snow. It is our meadow.

I understand that there are plans to build wooden walkways, vista stations, and bike trails at the
beach. I just don’t understand why. The meadow is gorgeous just as it is. There was a song by
Judy Collins back in the ‘60’s that mentions “paving paradise” and “putting in a parking lot.” I think
this is rather similar – planking paradise and putting in walkways. It’s simply not necessary.

Please leave the meadow alone. It is already perfect.

Thanks for your consideration.

Meadow adjacent to the Al Tahoe community
To the configuration members of the Barton Meadow plan:
Jacqui Grandfield
Norma Santiago
Katy Lovell
For almost a century the residents of Al Tahoe have used a system of informal trails along the
boarder that generally follows the Eldorado and Argonaut Streets. These trails currently blend in
with the edge habitat of the meadow.
Now the California Conservancy wants to stop all foot traffic along these trails and put in
intermittent viewing platforms that will become an attractive nuisance that will attract undesirable
auto traffic to the neighborhood streets and subsequent parking on very narrow streets. Viewing
platforms will attract beer parties, invite kids to climb on them, and block off access to the informal
trail systems.
If the goal is to keep people and their dogs out of the more sensitive areas then put in a Forest
Service type fence on the meadow side of these trails. This fence would be 4 feet high and
constructed of rustic wood with an open wire mesh, see through barrier, that would stop foot and
dog traffic. The fence would not be straight but rather meandering approximately 50 feet on the
meadow side of the trails. The leash law has not worked but a fence would.
We strongly object to the very formal and restrictive platforms and doing away with the century old
informal trail systems. Attendance of meetings, have shown us that the Conservancy wants the
entire meadow for wild life, but we urge you to save some of it for these grand fathered in, self
maintained hiking trails that surround Al Tahoe.

Results of Special-Status Plant Survey for the Upper Truckee River and Marsh
Restoration Project

Dear Mr. Robinson:
This letter report provides the methods and results of a special-status plant survey of the Upper
Truckee River and Marsh Restoration Project site. This survey was conducted in support of review of
the project under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and to provide baseline information
on the occurrence of special-status plants on the project site. The study area for this survey is
approximately 592 acres in size, and includes parcels owned by the California Tahoe Conservancy
(Conservancy), other public agencies, and private landowners (Exhibit 1). It includes the downstream
reaches of Trout Creek and the Upper Truckee River, adjacent wetland and uplands habitats, and the
Lower West Side (LWS) Wetlands Restoration Project site located in the northwest portion of the study
area, just east of the Tahoe Keys Marina. The special-status plant survey excluded areas of Barton
Beach and Cove East Beach where populations of Tahoe Yellow Cress (Rorippa subumbellata) are
known to occur and are the subject of an ongoing adaptive management plan (EDAW 2006).
The purpose of this special-status plant survey was to identify occurrences of additional special-status
plants that occur in the study area and could potentially be disturbed as a result of implementation of
the proposed restoration activities. In summary, a single population of American mannagrass (Glyceria
grandis), a CNPS List 2 was identified near the outlet of Trout Creek in the study area. The methods
and results of the survey are discussed in detail below.
METHODS
Pre-field Investigation
Before conducting the field survey, EDAW botanists conducted database searches and research to
compile a target list of plant species that are considered special-status species or are otherwise
considered sensitive by local resource agencies with potential to occur in the study area.
Special-status plants are defined as plants that are legally protected or that are otherwise considered
sensitive by federal, state or local resource conservation agencies and organizations. Special-status
plant taxa are species, subspecies or varieties that fall into one or more of the following categories:
►

officially listed by the state of California or the federal government as Endangered, Threatened or
Rare;

►

a candidate for state or federal listing as Endangered, Threatened or Rare;

Rick Robinson
California Tahoe Conservancy

►

taxa which meet the criteria for listing, even if not currently included on any list, as described in
Section 15380 of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines;

►

designated as a sensitive, special interest, or threshold species by TRPA;

►

designated as sensitive by the USFS Regional Forester in Region 5; and

►

taxa considered by the CNPS to be “rare, threatened or endangered in California” (Lists 1B and 2).

The CNPS Inventory includes five lists for categorizing plant species of concern, which are summarized
below. The plants listed on CNPS lists 1A, 1B, and 2 meet the definitions of Section 1901, Chapter 10
of the Native Plant Protection Act (NPPA) or Sections 2062 and 2067 (California Endangered Species
Act [CESA]) of the California Department of Fish and Game Code and may quality for state listing.
Therefore, they are considered rare plants pursuant to Section 15380 of CEQA. DFG recommends and
local government agencies may require that they be fully considered during preparation of
environmental documents pursuant to CEQA. Some of the plants constituting CNPS Lists 3 and 4 meet
the definitions of Section 1901, Chapter 10 or Sections 2062 and 2067 of the DFG Code and are
eligible for state listing, and many are also listed as sensitive species by the USFS. The CNPS lists are
categorized as follows:
►
►
►
►
►

List 1A - Plants presumed extinct in California;
List 1B - Plants rare, threatened, or endangered in California and elsewhere;
List 2 - Plants rare, threatened, or endangered in California but more common elsewhere;
List 3 - Plants about which we need more information - a review list
List 4 - Plants of limited distribution - a watch list

The primary sources of information in generating the target list of special-status plant species included
the California Native Plant Society’s (CNPS) Electronic Inventory of Rare and Endangered Vascular
Plants (CNPS 2007), the California Department of Fish and Game (DFG) California Natural Diversity
Database (CNDDB 2007), the TRPA threshold list of sensitive species, and the U.S. Forest Service,
Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit’s (LTBMU) list of sensitive species. The South Lake Tahoe,
Meeks Bay, Emerald Bay, Echo Lake, Freel Peak, and Woodsford U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5minute quadrangles were included in the CNPS and CNDDB database searches. In addition to these
sources, information was obtained by reviewing previously prepared environmental reports for the
project including, Upper Truckee River and Wetland Restoration Project: Processes and Functions of
the Upper Truckee Marsh (EDAW and ENTRIX 2003) and Upper Truckee River and Wetland
Restoration Final Concept Plan (EDAW 2006), and by consulting with a US Forest Service botanist
(Gross pers. comm.).
Table 1 contains information on all special-status plant species with potential to occur in the vicinity of
the project site. Based on a review of existing documentation, habitat types present, and the elevation
of the project site, twenty-four of these special-status plant species have potential to occur or are known
from the study area. The other twenty species identified in Table 1 are unlikely to occur because
suitable habitat for these species is not present in the study area. In preparation for the field surveys, a
survey package including photographs or line drawings of each of the target special-status plant
species was prepared to familiarize the field botanists conducting the surveys with the characteristics of
these species.
Field Surveys
EDAW botanists scheduled surveys to coincide with the blooming periods of the target plant species.
Field surveys on the project site were conducted by EDAW botanists Mark Bibbo and Richard

Dwerlkotte on July 24, 25, 26, and 27, 2007, for a total of 57 person-hours. Field surveys were
conducted by walking meandering transects throughout the entire study area. The protocol for the
special-status plant surveys followed DFG’s “Guidelines for Assessing the Effects of Proposed
Development on Rare, Threatened, and Endangered Plants and Plant Communities” (DFG 2000b) and
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (USFWS) Guidelines for Conducting and Reporting Botanical
Inventories for Federally Listed, Proposed, and Candidate Plants (USFWS 2000), which involve using
systematic field techniques in all habitats in the study area to ensure thorough coverage of potential
impact areas. All plants encountered during the surveys were identified to the highest taxonomic level
necessary for a rare plant determination. Nomenclature used follows the Jepson Manual Higher Plants
of California (Hickman 1993).
The locations of all special-status plants encountered were mapped by hand as either points or
polygons onto aerial photographs of the study area (scale 1” = 400’). In addition, GIS coordinates were
recorded for each location while in the field. These location points and polygons were later digitized
onto a GIS overlay to produce a map of the distribution of special-status plants in the study area. Notes
on habitat, topography, aspect, phenology, and associated species of the special-status plant species
identified were recorded on California Native Species Field Survey Forms to be submitted to the
CNDDB upon completion of the plant survey.
RESULTS
The Upper Truckee Marsh study area consists of a continuum of plant associations, ranging from
predominantly forested areas on the highest elevations of the site to wet meadow and riparian areas to
lagoon and sandy barrier beach at the northern end of the marsh near the shore of Lake Tahoe. The
distribution and extent of these plant communities on the project site is shown in Exhibit 2. Detailed
description of these plant communities can be found in the aforementioned report Upper Truckee River
and Wetland Restoration Project: Processes and Functions of the Upper Truckee Marsh (EDAW and
ENTRIX 2003).
A comprehensive list of all plant species observed during the survey is included in Table 2. One
special-status plant species (American mannagrass, Glyceria grandis) was documented within the
study area during the survey. A CNDDB data form for this occurrence is provided in Appendix A and is
cross-referenced to the location mapped in Exhibit 2. Representative photographs of American
mannagrass are provided in Appendix B. A description of American mannagrass is provided below.
The known locations of Tahoe Yellow Cress within the study area were visited, however, further
documentation of these populations is not provided as part of this report. The Barton Beach and Cove
East populations have previously been well documented and will be assessed again this year as part of
an annual multi-agency monitoring effort of known occurrences of Tahoe Yellow Cress around the lake
(EDAW 2006).
RESULTS BY SPECIES
American mannagrass
American manna grass (Glyceria grandis), is a rhizomatous grass that is on the California Native Plant
Society list 2.3 (rare, threatened, or endangered in California but common elsewhere). Outside of
California the species is much more common and is found from Alaska to Newfoundland in the north
(including all of the northwestern, midwestern, mid-Atlantic, and northeastern states), in the mountains
of Arizona and New Mexico in the southwest, and north of North Carolina and Tennessee in the
southeastern United States. In California it is known from Fresno, Humboldt, Mendocino, Mono, Placer,

and Tuolumne counties. There are no previously documented occurrences of American manna grass in
El Dorado County.
American manna grass grows in riparian habitats, on streambanks, lake-margins, meadows, and in
bogs and fens. It grows to a height of 3 feet tall and has a 7 to 15 inch long ovoid inflorescence bearing
small spikelets. The grass flowers between June and August. It is similar in overall appearance to fowl
mannagrass (Glyceria elata), which is much more common in California. It differs from fowl mannagrass
in having acute glumes with long veins, more evenly dark florets, flatter lemma apices, and paleal keel
tips that do not point towards each other. It can also be confused with pale fake mannagrass
(Torreyochloa pallida). It differs from this species in its closed leaf sheaths and 1-veined glumes (see
photos in Appendix B).
In the study area, American mannagrass was found in only one location growing on a low mud bench
within one of the active distributary channels of Trout Creek just above the surface water. Associated
species on the mud bench were pale fake mannagrass (Torreyochloa pallida), beaked sedge (Carex
utriculata), Baltic rush (Juncus balticus), fringed willow herb (Epilobium ciliatum), and wild mint (Mentha
arvense). Approximately 35 flowering stems were observed in a 10 square foot area. Nearby
mannagrass species, thought to be fowl mannagrass (Glyceria elata), had a very different appearance
characterized by much greener lemmas and inflorescence, a slightly smaller inflorescence, and smaller,
more rounded glumes.
If you have any questions regarding the methods and results of this special-status plant survey or
require additional information, please do not hesitate to call us at (916) 414-5800.

PHOTO VIEWPOINTS
This appendix includes a complete index of the viewpoints from which photographs were taken for the project.
Because of the large number of photographs and the similarities between many of them, a representative set of
photographs was selected for inclusion in Section 3.14, “Scenic Resources.” The selected set of photographs in
the scenic resources section is representative of the existing views of the study area. Photographs are identified by
letters or numbers. The numbered viewpoints shown below are shown in the scenic resources section and follow
the same numbering sequence used in that section. Lettered viewpoints shown below are in addition to those
included in Section 3.14, “Scenic Resources.” Exhibit 1 provides an overview of the locations of the photo
viewpoints.

APPENDIX E
Alternative Cost Estimates

INITIAL COST ANALYSIS
In 2006, estimated costs for each Alternative were developed using standard cost estimating practices for civil
engineering and environmental restoration projects. This information was created for the Concept Plan Report
prepared for the project in 2006 and represents the alternatives at this stage in some instances features have been
added or deleted and therefore do not represent the most current alternatives. The purpose of this section was
simply to provide a relative representation of the costs of the various alternatives. A summary of the results are
presented in the following table. Table 1 provides estimated costs based on estimated quantities and information
available at that time. They were developed for planning purposes only and based on best available information.
In order to evaluate the four alternatives, general assumptions were made and applied similarly to each alternative.
These included typical cross-sections of new channel, typical cross-sections of existing channel to be filled,
spacing of habitat improvement features, construction access road width and length, etc. Unit costs were derived
using a combination of actual costs from LWS and Trout Creek Restoration projects, cost publications like
RSMeans Site Work and Landscape Cost Data, data provided by resource agencies like Washington State
Department of Fish and Wildlife and Alaska Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the design teams extensive
knowledge of the site and professional experience. Design and permitting costs were included as 40% of
construction.
Based on total cost, Alternative 3 is least expensive, followed by Alternative 2, 1, and 4. Total costs range from
$5.9M for Alternative 3 to $19.7M for Alternative 4. This large range is due primarily to the differences in
earthwork volumes and level of recreation infrastructure. If only site work, contractor costs, design and permitting
costs are considered, since the three levels of recreation infrastructure, maximum, moderate and minimum, could
be easily applied to any of the 4 alternatives, the only change in the resulting ranking is that Alternative 1 and 2
are switched.
