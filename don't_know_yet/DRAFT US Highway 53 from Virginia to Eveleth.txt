There are four corridors currently being considered.  The Minnesota Natural Heritage Information System has been queried to determine if any rare plant or animal species, native plant communities, or other significant natural features are known to occur within an approximate one-mile radius of the corridor options.   Within all four corridors, there are no High or Outstanding Sites of Biodiversity Significance defined, nor do they intersect with DNR old-growth or Scientific Natural Areas (SNAs).  However we offer the following considerations for the corridors currently being proposed: West Corridor (WC):  1. Public Waters: a. Two basins: Lake Manganika. (PWI # 62-726P), and Long Lake (PWI # 69-653P). b. Three Public Watercourses would need to be crossed with this alignment:  Elbow Creek, the outlet from Lake Manganika and Long Lake Creek. It is not known if there would be impacts to Lake Manganika or Long Lake.  However, regardless of road near the lake, a Public Waters Work permit would be required for the crossings of the three streams.  2. Rare Features: a. Our files show an eagles nest on Lake Manganika.  The most recent entry (2005) lists the nest as inactive. We do not know if the nest has been active since then. 3. Natural areas: a. This corridor has the least altered terrain and as such, this corridor is more likely to have adverse impacts to area wildlife than the other options. 4. Mineral Resources and Mine Development: a. This corridor would have little or no impact on ferrous mineral resources or future taconite mine development. Central Corridor (CC):  1. Public Waters: none 2. Rare Features: none known 3. Natural areas: none.  This corridor is 100% altered terrain. 4. Mineral Resources and Mine Development: a. This corridor would route the highway through mined out portions of United Taconite's pit, and allow for the continued operation of this mine and continued taconite development progressing to the north. Ambient air quality may be an issue with this alternative.  MNDOT would have to work with United Taconite on a design that would ensure that mining equipment could move over the highway or under the highway in a manner that was safe for the public and provide United Taconite with needed mine equipment movement. North East Corridors (NEC-A and NEC-B): 1. Public Waters: a. Lake Virginia (PWI # 62-663P) b. Unnamed Tributary to (PWI # 62-663P).   It is not known if there would be impacts to Lake Virginia.  However, regardless of design at the lake, a Public Waters Work permit would be required for the crossing of the stream. 2. Rare Features: a. Our files show that Peregrine Falcons were utilizing the old Rouchleau Mine cliffs in the 1990’s.  We do not know if they continue to utilize this area.   Should this corridor more forward, we would need to survey the area in the spring to verify its use or non-use as a nesting site for the falcons. 3. Recreational Use: a. The NE corridors contain the new Iron Range Off Highway Vehicle Recreational Area (IROHVRA). b. The relocation of TH 53 and the mine expansion will impact several snowmobile trails connecting Virginia, Eveleth and Gilbert (specifically the Eveleth-Virginia Spur Trail).  During the planning process we recommend simultaneously exploring and developing multi-use opportunities including OHV connections to the three towns and IROHVRA.  Let us know if we can assist in this. 4. Mineral Resources and Mine Development: a. The area of corridors NEC-A and NEC-B contains known underground mine workings, and known areas of ground subsidence and caving due to underground mining. (Corridor NEC-B is aligned along a ¼ mile stretch of subsidence into U/G mine workings.) The full extent of underground mining in this area is not known. (Not all mines were mapped, and not all maps are accessible.) Given the recent history of HWY 169 in Chisholm, safety and cost factors related to potential highway subsidence into underground mine workings should eliminate consideration of any northeast corridor. b. The area surrounding corridors NEC-A and NEC-B contains known mineral resources and magnetic taconite reserves, and will be used for future mine development. Any highway route chosen in this area would necessitate future re-alignment, or would preclude development of valuable state and private minerals. The encumbrance of state owned and private minerals would require compensation to the owners.  In addition, mine stockpiles and tailings basins would be impacted by any route chosen within this area. Complex ownership issues arise regarding personal property within stockpiles and tailings basins. Encumbrance of these resources would require compensation to the owners. This highway is being realigned due to current mine expansion. It should not be routed through areas of valuable mineral resources and future mine expansions.

The project proposes four different relocation alternatives due to the expansion of the United Taconite iron mine.  Three alternatives NE C-A, NE C-B and CC are relatively short (1.6 to 3 miles) route the highway south and east of the City of Virginia.  Alternative WC is 11.5 miles long and extends along TH 37 west of TH 53, then north near the Canadian National Railroad until it reaches County Road 7 and reconnecting with TH 53 at the southwest end of Virginia.  The Bois Forte THPO has no record of cultural or religious properties within the proposed APE of any alternative, but recommends cultural resource inventories be undertaken no matter which of the routes is chosen. Due to the presence of sites adjacent to or within the APE’s of the proposed routes the THPO wishes to continue consultation under 36 CFR Part 800.2(c). Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this project.

This information has been reviewed according to the responsibilities given the State Historic Preservation Officer by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, and implementing federal regulations found at 36 CFR Part 800. For archaeology, we reviewed the detailed information and site photos assembled during survey and evaluation of the Rouchleau Shops (21 SL 1135). Based on the information provided, we agree that site 21 SL 1135, the Rouchleau Shops, are not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. Many historic and architectural properties were evaluated for National Register eligibility. The survey report and forms were well done and complete. However, only two sites were recommended as eligible: the West 51h Avenue South Boulevard (SL-VGC-152) and the Range Paper Company (SL-VGC-150). Based on the information provided, we agree that the West 51h Avenue South Boulevard, including the period lamp posts, is eligible for the National Register. However, we do not concur that the Range Paper Company is eligible. In our opinion, the physical integrity of this building has been significantly compromised by covering the original masonry of the office portion (the building's primary facade) with vinyl siding. Covering the second story office windows, replacement of windows on the first floor, and the relocation of the main entrance have also negatively affected the building. In its current condition, the building does not retain sufficient historical integrity to support National Register eligibility. We look forward to completing consultation on this project, when road relocation plans are more fully developed. Meanwhile, if you have any questions regarding our review, please call me at (651) 259-3456. Sincerely, f / ~~~ ~~14#?'Mary Ann ei e ann, Manager G'Overn ent Pr grams and Compliance / cc: Carole Zellie, Landscape Research LLC Minnesota Histoncal Society. 345 Kellogg Boulevard West.

Temporary dewatering of the Rouchleau mine pit may be undertaken to allow for the construction of a causeway through the pit with fill below the current water line. Three alternative pipeline routes have been identified, designated as the West Two Rivers Option, the Minntac Tailings Basin Cell 2 Option, and the Enterprise Pit Option (see enclosed map). All options involve a temporary water pipe to be placed on top of the ground surface. The pipe will be in place approximately three to six months. It will be placed primarily within the right-ofway of existing roads, railroad, and power line routes. Ground disturbance will occur only for crossing of existing driveways and roads that intersect TH 169, US 53 and at a few locations within the mines (Minntac and ArcelorMittal) where the pipeline crosses haul or access roads. There are no known archaeological sites along the pipeline routes and because the pipe will be located on top of the ground or placed below existing roads, there is little potential for disturbing any unknown sites.

One of the alternatives being considered crosses into a portion of School Trust land (Section 16) of which much of this parcel has been master planned by the DNR to be used as an off highway vehicle recreation area. However, the portion of Section 16 west of Landfill Road is not included in the 2010 Iron Range Off-Highway Vehicle Recreational Area Master Plan for recreational use (Figure 3 of the master plan amendment 20 I 0). It states: • On page 15; refers to area west of Landfill Road as "auxiliary mining lands"-suggesting lands are subject to future mining • Page 16 continues this idea; says that taconite reserves "will remain available for future mining without encumbrance from the ... OHVRA" • Figures 3 & 8 (taken together) show an "unused area" west of Landfill Road and illustrate that Landfill Road follows along the edge of the Biwabik Iron Formation • The rest of the OHVRA site is described as: "The Virginia site, or project area, will be developed exclusively for trail riding for all classes of Off-highway Vehicles (OHV s ), All-terrain Vehicles (ATVs), Off-Highway Motorcycles (OHMs), and Off-road Vehicles (ORVs); ORVs include larger vehicles such as 4x4 trucks and jeeps." Based on the 2010 OHVRA Master Plan showing the portion Section 16 west of Landfill Road, FHW A would interpret that this area has no existing or intended recreational use. Your concurrence with this interpretation is requested as this interpretation is important to determination of impacts to be included in the EIS. If the area west of Landfill Road, as described above, has no existing or planned recreational use, the Federal Highway Administration would intend to declare the OHVRA a multiple use facility in the eyes of Section 4(f). Therefore, the portion of the OHVRA west oflandfill road would not be considered a Section 4(f) property in the assessment of impacts for this US Highway 53 EIS. January 3, 2013 Philip Forst, Environmental Specialist Federal Highway Administration 380 Jackson St., Galtier Plaza, Suite 500 St. Paul, MN 55101-4802 Re: Iron Range Off-Highway Vehicle Recreational Area Section 4(f) Designation Dear Mr. Forst: Your letter on the above mentioned matter, dated November 14, 2012 has been given to me for a response. Your assessment of Off-Highway Vehicle use of the land in Section 16 lying west of the St. Louis County landfill road is essentially correct, no use is planned for that part of section 16.  With the concerns the City of Virginia had expressed with motorized use close to the open pit where the City water supply is drawn from, we decided to keep all activity east of the landfill road. With that said, the OHV site has also agreed to work with the local snowmobile club and provide access to the City of Virginia. Currently the snowmobile trail from the east range comes through the Gilbert site, crossing on the existing OHV bridge over the DM&IR tracks, continuing on the OHV trail into the City of Gilbert. Three years ago when we worked with MNDOT to install an underpass under highway 135 in Gilbert that structure was sized to accommodate snowmobile groomers as well as off-highway vehicles.  The thought being with the moving of highway 53, the snowmobile connection between Eveleth and Virginia would be lost and they would be able to reestablish that trail by going through the OHV site.  So my concern with the proposed highway 53 alignment is trying to ensure that project does not hamper or prevent us from making that winter trail connection.  If the bridge or road over Rouchleau Pit has a pedestrian path that could accommodate snowmobiles and a trail groomer then I don’t see any major issues with the proposal. We had hoped to route the snowmobile trail further north but with ISPAT’s current in pit dumping that is no longer an option.  Second option was to put something adjacent to the Mesabi Trail but with this mining expansion that will no longer be an option.  Therefore if the new highway alignment could accommodate this trail the system could remain intact with this new connection. If you have any questions please let me know and thank you for the opportunity to review and comment on your alternatives. Ron Potter Project Manager 500 Lafayette Road St. Paul, MN 55155 cc Courtland Nelson Laura Preus Debra Moynihan -MnDOT United States Department of the Interior FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE Twin Cities Field Office 4101 American Blvd E.

In particular, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MN/DOT) is planning to abandon and remove a one-mile segment of the four-lane US53 that is subject to an expiring lease and reroute the trunk highway under one of two proposed alternatives near Virginia, Minnesota. Alternative M-1 would realign the highway through the existing Auburn Pit operated by United Taconite. Alternative E-2 would follow MN135 to the northeast before cutting northwest through a disturbed forested and across the abandoned Rouchleau Pit east ofVirginia, Minnesota. Canada Lynx (Lynx canadensis), which is federally threatened, has been documented within I 0 miles of the project area and designated Critical Habitat for the species is within five miles. Construction related impacts are expected to occur, however they are all within disturbed areas outside of Critical Habitat where Canada Lynx are less likely to occur. Given that the original highway is removed and the new highway segment maintains the same speed limit and remains outside of Critical Habitat, we do not foresee increased risks to Canada Lynx. We concur with your determination that the funded activities may affect, but are not likely to adversely affect Canada Lynx in the action area, as indicated in the materials provided by you. This concludes consultation under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, as amended.

This designation would have resulted in the OHVRA area west of Landfill Road not to be designated as a Section 4(f) resource. MnDNR’s response via a letter dated January 3, 2013, concurred with FHWA’s assessment the OHVRA (west of Landfill Road) as a multiple-use portion of the facility.  The alternatives under consideration have been refined since 2012.  This refinement has resulted in additional impacts to the OHVRA that must be considered in the NEPA process. The OHVRA east of Landfill Road, a recreational resource, is subject to Section 4(f) of the United States Department of Transportation Act of 1966.  The Section 4(f) process is simplified when there are only de minimis impacts (very minor impacts) to a Section 4(f) resource. If the FHWA makes a de minimis determination of a project’s Section 4(f) impacts to a resource, the Section 4(f) process is satisfied and no further analysis is needed. A Section 4(f) de minimis determination may be issued solely on the very minor nature of impacts or the net impact to a Section 4(f) resource (impacts plus mitigation provided to agency with jurisdiction over the resource). Alternatives E-1A and E-2 would cause a Section 4(f) use (strip land acquisition) at the western edge of the OHVRA (east of Landfill Road) as shown in the enclosed figure. 2.4acres impacted by Alternative E-2, and 3.6 acres impacted by Alternative E-1A There may be additional impacts to the OHVRA Section 4(f) resource during project construction. It is anticipated that those impacts would meet the criteria of a ‘temporary occupancy’ that would not have an adverse effect on the OHVRA (based on the criteria in 23CFR774.13(d)), and therefore would not constitute a Section 4(f) ‘use.’ The alternatives are still being refined and we do not currently know enough about design and anticipated construction staging to determine the extent of any additional impacts. FHWA will engage the MnDNR as part of the appropriate Section 4(f) process once we have an understanding of the additional impacts, if any, to the OHVRA.  The engagement will be in writing, should occur prior to the dismissal of any alternative currently under consideration, and should be resolved prior to the issuance of a Final Environmental Impact Statement. After reviewing the MnDNR’s January 2010 Master Plan for the Virginia OHVRA area and existing site conditions, FHWA has the following observations: • The overall size of the Virginia OHVRA site is 2,704 acres. The 2.4 acres or 3.6 acres of impact for Alternatives E-2 and E-1A, respectively, would be very minor, in terms of overall size of the Section 4(f) resource. • The purpose of the OHVRA is to provide trails for off-highway vehicles (OHVs) and will be developed exclusively for trail riding for all classes of motorized OHVs including all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), off-highway motorcycles (OHMs), and off-road vehicles (ORVs). ORVs include larger vehicles such as 4x4 trucks and jeeps. The main OHV trail segment to be developed would be roughly parallel to Landfill Road ¼ to ½ mile to the east running for about ¾ mile through this area, and would not be affected by either alternative. • The Master Plan shows the planned OHV trails are located outside of the illustrated impact areas. There are no existing or planned improvements within the identified impact areas (currently open space). • The areas that would be acquired under each alternative are in areas of the OHVRA that are not designated for any specific use, activity or feature. The purpose of the OHVRA is for off-road vehicle use; however, those uses are currently restricted to developed trails or designated use areas. The impact areas for Alternatives E-1A and E-2 are not located within any special use areas or planned trail corridors in the OHVRA based on the area January 2010 master plan. A review of the impacts and proposed construction for Alternatives E-1A or E-2 show that, in FHWA’s opinion, the direct impacts to the OHVRA will be minimal and will not adversely affect the features, attributes, or activities qualifying the OHVRA for protection under Section 4(f).  Furthermore, the US 53 traffic noise would not substantially impair the activities, features, or attributes of the OHVRA. Based on this assessment, FHWA intends to make de minimis Section 4(f) determination. Consistent with Section 4(f) requirements, an opportunity for the public to comment on the proposed de minimis finding will be provided during the public comment period on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS). FHWA may not make the Section 4(f) de minimis finding without your written concurrence that neither Alternative E-1A nor Alternative E-2 will adversely affect the activities, features, and attributes of the OHVRA. Your written response should explicitly address if MnDNR concurs that neither Alternative E-1A nor Alternative E-2 will adversely affect the activities, features, and attributes of the OHVRA and if MnDNR’s concurrence with FHWA’s assessment of impacts to OHVRA varies by alternative. If your agency does not concur with FHWA’s assessment of impacts to the OHVRA, please contact David Dominguez (david.dominguez@dot.gov) or Philip Forst at the Minnesota Division Office of the FHWA. Please contact me at (651) 291-6110 or phil.forst@dot.gov if you have any questions.

This project is critical to the future of United Taconite and the $273 million dollars in annual economic impact the operation has on its surrounding communities and the State as a whole.  The purpose of this letter is to share United Taconite’s position on a through-pit alignment of Highway 53 (M-1 Alignment) and explain why this route option would greatly encumber UTAC’s ability to operate into the future. Since the termination notice of the Highway 53 easement agreement was delivered, Cliffs/United Taconite has been conducting its own examination of the potential routes, in particular the through-pit alignment, and the impact on mine operations. This has involved several layers of the Cliffs organization and United Taconite over a number of years, looking at our current mine operations, future plans, regulations and ever-changing economics affecting the industry. Throughout this process, Cliffs has communicated a number of concerns related to the through-pit alignment, including: air quality compliance, blasting impacts, safety risks, mine operational challenges and significant ore reserve impediments. Following a thorough analysis of these concerns, Cliffs determined that we cannot risk the future viability of United Taconite by encumbering ore, creating an environmental compliance risk or accepting health and safety hazards that come with the through-pit alignment (M-1). Therefore, UTAC cannot support issuance of an easement for the M-1 corridor. We believe this position is necessary to ensure that the highway relocation proceeds in a manner that does not threaten the viability of United Taconite or impose unreasonable costs on the State.  We are committed to continue working with MnDOT in order to help the agency deliver a new corridor that is acceptable to the public and allows for the continued viability of mining in the area. Sincerely, Haase, Rachel ‐‐‐‐‐Original Message‐‐‐‐From: Wierzbinski, Daryl W MVP [mailto:Daryl.W.Wierzbinski@usace.army.mil] Sent: Wednesday, June 04, 2014 3:36 PM To: Dwyer, Roberta (DOT) Subject: waters of the U.S. (UNCLASSIFIED) Classification: UNCLASSIFIED Caveats: NONE Roberta, Please see attached.

(SEH).  The three other alternatives under consideration (M-1, E-1A, and E-2) were not evaluated as part of this economic analysis because the differences in travel distance and time as compared to the existing route are negligible from an economic impact standpoint.  Economic impacts quantified in this report include significant economic and government service categories, but do not include all of the economic impacts that businesses, residents, and visitors to the area would experience.  As such, they represent a snapshot of economic and service impacts, but are not all inclusive of all economic impacts that would result from Alternative W-1A.  In addition, there are numerous quality of life impacts that, by their very nature, are difficult to identify and quantify. Highway 53 is a north/south route extending from International Falls on the north to Duluth/Superior and south into Wisconsin.  The area between Virginia and Eveleth is also the route for Highway 135, an east/west route connecting the East Iron Range area to Virginia, Mountain Iron, and cities to the north and west.  These two highways cross the Biwabik Iron Formation, which flows through the area similar to a river with Highway 53 being a major “river crossing” between Buhl to the west and Aurora to the east. The study area has the greater Virginia area as its core and extends generally from Hibbing on the west to Hoyt Lakes and Babbitt on the east, and the areas north and south of the Biwabik Iron Formation.  The greater Virginia area including Mountain Iron, Eveleth, and Gilbert is known as the Quad Cities.  Virginia serves as the shopping, cultural, social, and governmental center for the East Range area.  The Quad Cities are separated by the Biwabik Iron Formation--Virginia and Mountain Iron on the west and the Midway portion of Virginia, Eveleth, and Gilbert on the east. This report assumes that a new route for Highway 53 will be operational for a full year in 2017. Economic impacts are calculated through 2037.  Economic impacts are divided into two time periods.  The first time period is 2017-2023, when it is assumed that County Road 101, a connection between Highway 7 and Highway 53 through Eveleth (County Road 101), will be operational and provide an alternative shorter route to Alternative W-1A.  This road is assumed to be closed by mining operations by 2024 making the Alternative W-1A the only available route.  Economic impacts for motorists using County Road 101 during the 2017-2023 period will be lower.  The full economic impacts will occur for the 2024-2037 period of the analysis. Economic impacts quantified in this report are summarized below. User Costs Cost benefit analysis determined that Alternative W-1A would result in increased user costs between 2017 and 2037 of $765.4 million, discounted at 2.2 percent to 2013.  Increased annual user costs for 2017 were estimated at $32.0 million, which discounts to $29.9 million in 2013.  In 2024, increased user costs were estimated at $43.4 million, which discounts to $34.2 million in 2013. xi Commuter Costs Work locations of study area employed residents were analyzed for 2011 and determined that about 5,500 workers that would experience increased travel times as a result of Alternative W1A.  These commuters are expected to total about 6,000 in 2017, 6,900 in 2024, and 8,600 in 2037.  The total value of commuter user costs for the period 2017 to 2037 is $449.2 million.  The discounted value is $323.8 million in 2013 dollars.  These commuters are included in the cost benefit analysis described above, but demonstrate how Alternative W-1A affects one user group. The annual impact on individual commuters represents a significant portion of their income. Workers living or working in East Range cities (Eveleth, Gilbert, McKinley, Biwabik, Aurora, and Hoyt Lakes) and commuting over the current Highway 53 route will drive an additional 7,650 miles annually and spend an additional 152 hours commuting with Alternative W-1A. Annual travel and time costs for each employee are estimated at $4,653.  This is about $18.61 per day or $2.33 per hour.  Annual increased commuting costs of this magnitude will cause workers to consider changing either their home or work location. Retail Impacts Virginia, Mountain Iron, and Eveleth contain the Quad Cities’ largest concentration of retail stores and services.  The largest retail concentration is Virginia and the eastern portion of Mountain Iron.  Virginia/Mountain Iron retail sales in 2017 are estimated at $560.9 million in 2013 dollars.  Market research found that 33 percent of these sales or $183.7 million were derived from customers living in the East Range area.  The longer drive time associated with a shopping trip to Virginia/Mountain Iron resulting from the Alternative W-1A route was estimated to result in a sales transfer of $41.7 million or 7.4 percent of total sales in the 20172023 period. In 2024, retail sales are expected to be about $645 million (in 2013 dollars) with $211 million derived from shoppers residing in the East Range area.  Of this amount, $95 million, or 14.7 percent of total sales are estimated to be transferred to retail stores in other locations.  Most of these sales will transfer to Duluth and Hermantown, which have much larger retail areas and offer greater selection.  Some convenience goods and service spending will transfer to businesses in East Range cities. Employment in retail establishments is closely related to sales volume.  Reduced retail sales in Virginia are estimated to result in a loss of 372 jobs in the 2017-2023 period increasing to 844 jobs after 2024. Eveleth retailers are also affected by sales transfer resulting from Alternative W-1A.  Market research found that 34 percent of Eveleth retail sales are derived from customers living in Virginia and cities to the west and north.  Eveleth’s retail sales are estimated at $87.2 million in 2017 with $29.9 million derived from shoppers living to the west and north.  Retail sales transfer resulting from Alternative W-1A is estimated at $9.2 million or 10.5 percent of retail sales. Retail sales transfer increases in 2024 resulting from closing County Road 101.  In that year, retail sales are estimated at $100.1 million with $34.3 million derived from shoppers living west xii and north of the Biwabik Iron Formation.  Sales transfer is estimated at $20.1 million of estimated 2024 retail sales. Reduced retail sales at Eveleth retail establishments will result in the loss of an estimated 76 jobs in the 2017-2023 period, increasing to 154 jobs in the 2024-2037 period. Business Impacts Businesses in the study area make deliveries or service calls to customers living on either side of the Biwabik Iron Formation resulting in frequent trips over Highway 53.  Market research based on business survey responses estimated increased travel and payroll cost to local businesses of $45.9 million in the 2017-2023 period, increasing to $97.0 million annually in the 2024-2037 period.  Businesses in the survey reported higher operating and time costs than utilized in the user cost analysis. Sixty-four business survey respondents identified 124 companies that made a total of 787 deliveries per week.  This is an average of 12.3 deliveries per week for each business.  Many of these deliveries include distributors of food, beverages, and other consumer products that are from cities outside the Iron Range area. Lodging and Attractions The Virginia/Mountain Iron lodging industry has stronger operating characteristics than the Eveleth/Midway area.  Occupied room nights, occupancy rate, and the average daily room rate are all higher.  Operating characteristics of the three properties in the Eveleth/Midway area indicate a lodging industry that is characterized by lower occupied room nights, occupancy rate, and average daily room rate. The cumulative impacts of shifts in traffic flow and accessibility for lodging properties in Eveleth/Midway resulting from Alternative W-1A will have severe impacts on occupancy and room rates at these properties.  The negative impacts associated with Alternative W-1A for Eveleth/Midway properties include: ♦ Reduced traffic counts on Highway 53 that will eliminate almost all of the drive-by traffic. ♦ Severing the convenient connection between Virginia and Eveleth/Midway will reduce the area’s attraction to business guests, as many of the businesses are located in Virginia and areas to the west. ♦ Tourist occupancy is expected to decline due to reduced access and convenience to the Virginia area. The combination of these three factors will cause the eventual closing of all three lodging properties in Eveleth/Midway. The Hockey Hall of Fame in Eveleth is dependant on the tourism traffic on Highway 53 and is, according to hotel survey respondents, responsible for about 825 room nights at local lodging xiii establishments.  The loss of drive-by visitor traffic will result in significant decline in attendance at the Hockey Hall of Fame and could result in it closing. Workforce Aging The East Range area had 7,021 employed workers in 2011.  Between 2012 and 2037, over 4,000 of these workers will reach retirement age.  About 1,400 of these workers (36 percent) commute to jobs in Virginia and areas to the west and north.  Jobs held by these retiring workers will be filled by new workers.  Alternative W-1A and its longer drive time are likely to influence where these replacement workers will live.  The result will be reduced demand for housing and fewer customers for local businesses in East Range cities. Real Estate Impacts Realtors commented that Alternative W-1A would reduce the demand for housing in the East Range cities and anticipated it would cause a 10 percent decrease in market values.  Commercial and industrial real estate demand would also be affected.  However, due to the current high vacancy rate, the impact would be less. Development Impacts The additional travel times between East and West Range areas for work, shopping, and other household travel resulting from Alternative W-1A will influence household choices on where to live on the part of existing residents and potential new residents.  Study area employment was estimated to increase by about 10,950 between 2017 and 2037.  Adding the impact of employee retirements increases potential new employees to about 15,000 between 2017 and 2037. Residential areas in Virginia and other West Range cities will have a competitive edge in attracting new residential development created by increased employment.  These same forces will reduce the demand for resale of existing homes in East Range communities. Private Sector Summary Increased travel and time costs associated with Alternative W-1A will have broad economic impacts on residents, businesses, and visitors to the area.  Many of the impacts will be reflected in diminished lifestyle for those traveling east/west across the Biwabik Iron Formation.  Private sector economic impacts associated with Alternative W-1A over the period 2017-2023 were calculated two ways: 20-year discounted value of user costs and annual increased costs for representative years of 2017 and 2024. Twenty-year present value of user costs was estimated at $765 million.  The portion of this cost associated with worker commuting was estimated at over $323 million. Annual economic impacts associated with Alternative W-1A are summarized in Table i for 2017-2023 and 2024-2037. xiv Table i INCREASED ANNUAL COSTS SELECTED IMPACT CATEGORIES Impact Category 2017-23 2024-37 Employee Commuting Costs $    13,256,060 $ 22,292,756 Business Increased Travel Costs 45,904,447 97,043,447   Toal 59,160,507 119,336,203 Virginia Lost Retail Sales 41,657,000 94,845,000 Eveleth Lost Retail Sales 9,193,000 20,116,000     Total $    50,850,000 $    114,961,000 Lost Retail Jobs Virginia 372 843 Eveleth 76 154   Total 448 997 Source: McComb Group, Ltd. Annual private sector costs for employee commuting and business travel costs total $59.2 million in 2017 increasing to $119.3 million annually in 2024.  Retail sales transfer was estimated at $50.8 million in 2017 and $115.0 million in 2024.  Total long-term annual economic impacts for only these categories are estimated at over $234 million, not including the lost wages for about 1,000 retail workers. Foreseeable additional impacts in East Range communities resulting from the longer distance and travel times associated with Alternative W-1A include: ♦ Employees living in Virginia and areas west and north will experience higher commuting costs. ♦ Employers will experience difficulty in retaining and attracting workers from Virginia and areas west and north. ♦ Convenience retail and services will experience short-term increase in business until declining population reduces demand. ♦ Businesses will experience higher costs to serve customers in Virginia and areas west and north. ♦ Reduced demand for housing and lower prices for existing homes. ♦ Higher commuting costs may cause workers to seek jobs closer to home. ♦ Increased travel costs for work, shopping, and other trips will reduce income for other household purchases. ♦ Residents and businesses that use St. Louis County services will experience longer travel times to government offices. ♦ St. Louis County will experience higher costs to provide services in the East Range area. xv Retail stores and services in East Range cities are primarily convenience businesses that serve a local market.  These businesses may experience increased sales as competitors in Virginia become more distant and are less convenient to visit.  Eventually, sales for these businesses will decline as population declines due to the higher travel costs and time required to reach the Virginia area for shopping, social, and recreational activities, and government services.  If these sales declines result in businesses closing, the area becomes less attractive to residents. These are but a few of the economic and social impacts of Alternative W-1A on residents, businesses, and other entities in East Range cities. Public Sector Impacts Eliminating the current Highway 53 route between Virginia and the East Range cities will have significant impacts on emergency services, educational institutions, cities, and other agencies. Residents living in seven cities, together with surrounding rural areas, depend upon shared services making travel among communities frequent and necessary.  Shared services include: ambulance, police, fire, education k-12, special education, a two campus community and technical college, St. Louis County Social Services, and economic development agencies, to name just a few. The Alternative W-1A route will add a minimum of 20 minutes one way, in addition to the time it already takes, to emergency response times; lengthening the Golden Hour (the time period when prompt medical treatment will prevent death).  Also, Virginia is the only town equipped with access to an emergency helipad and has the only Advanced Life Support unit in the area. Essentia Health is in the process of investing millions into the facilities in Virginia to make it a regional secondary hub to Duluth for regular and emergency health services. The sheriff’s office, jail, and court house are located in Virginia.  Increase travel times limits access to and from area communities. Area fire and police departments have entered into mutual aid agreements whereby they support one another.  Virginia owns the only ladder truck for fire safety and rescue. Local schools (pre-school- 12) transport children among the various communities as part of open enrollment and transport children as part of shared services and classes.  Increased travel time puts the students and the services at risk. Mesabi Range Community and Technical College has two campuses (Virginia and Eveleth). College students and high school students from their home schools travel between the campuses to take advantage of the course work available.  Increased travel time puts the programming and students at risk. xvi Services provided by Northeast Special Education Co-op, Arrowhead Economic Opportunity Agency, and Range Mental Health Center - serving children and adults spread across the area communities will be affected.  Increased travel time inhibits the ability for these services to reach out to area communities. Local governments, schools, and other agencies identified the additional annual operating costs and capital expenditures that would result from the Alternative W-1A route.  These costs are summarized in Table ii.  Increased annual costs total $4.3 million and capital costs are estimated at $24.5 million. Table ii INCREASED ANNUAL EXPENSES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RESULTING FROM ALTERNATIVE W-1A Annual Cost  Capital Expenditures  Virginia Public Works Utility Relocation Police Department Fire Department Park and Recreation Public Schools    Subtotal  $     480,000 1,560,000 1,607,1003,647,100  $ 475,000 20,000,000 3,740,000 260,000 $  24,475,000  Eveleth  Public Works Tri Cities    Subtotal  $ $  16,400 11,80028,200  Eveleth-Gilbert Public Schools  Transportation Costs Arrowhead Transit  $ $  66,000 554,882  Total  $     4,296,182  $  24,475,000  Source:  SEH.  Arrowhead Transit provided cost estimates indicating that in the 2017-2023 period, it would experience increased operating costs in 2013 dollars of $370,000 per year and $554,000 over the longer term after 2023. Alternative W-1A will impose the highest cost increase on Virginia; while the emergency response impacts will fall on East Range cities and their residents, employees, and businesses. xvii Technical Memorandum •  Date:  November 13, 2013  Suite 238N  2550 University Avenue West  To:  Roberta Dwyer, MnDOT  St. Paul, Minnesota 55114  From: Jerry Schwientek, P.E., and Beth Kunkel Subject: Structural Cost Estimate for Elevated Tunnel for US 53 Alternative M-1 Air Quality Mitigation As part of our evaluation of options to provide a physical barrier/cover over US 53 through the mine on the M-1 alignment, several options were considered. All but one of these options were ultimately deemed unsuitable due to concerns with constructability, loading capacity, durability, maintenance, and/or costs. Options considered included: 1) Cast-in-Place tunnel 2) Steel framed structure 3) Prefabricated buildings 4) Fabric structures, such as for Agricultural use 5) Precast 3-sided structure Considering these options, it was determined the most appropriate option for further evaluation was a 3-sided precast structure on pedestal walls as shown below. This proposed structure type will meet the durability requirement of a structure expected to have a 75 year or greater service life, provide protection from expected mining activities, provide crash resistant walls, support snow and wind loads, and require minimal annual maintenance. To develop a cost estimate for purposes of evaluating this tunnel option, a precast 3-sided structure on pedestal walls with spread foundations was assumed, with a separating wall at the median. To accommodate the air/fire ventilation equipment, a 30-foot section every 250 feet was included to provide the additional required vertical clearance. The dimensions of this proposed structure are as identified in the following table. Tunnel Width  Vertical Clearance  Cross Section  (2) 36’-0” Tunnels  17’-4” (24’-0’ at ventilation equipment)  (2) 12’-0” lanes and an 8’-0” Shoulder each direction  The approximate planning level unit cost for a 3-sided structure of this type was $165/sq.ft. (which includes $80/sq. ft. for the precast and $85/sq. ft. for the pedestal walls). Since the pedestal walls can be designed for a vehicular impact load, additional barriers on the inside of the tunnel will not be required. Structural costs for the two tunnel lengths are summarized below. 3,000 foot length  6,100 foot length  $35,640,000  $72,470,000  Other items that would be required as part of the structural cost estimate include: fire protection (hydrant hook ups), sanitary sewer collection from tunnel, storm sewer, and tunnel lighting. Approximate costs for those are summarized below for the two tunnel sizes. 3,000 foot length  6,100 foot length  Fire Protection  $270,000  $550,000  Sanitary Sewer  $255,000  $520,000  Storm Sewer  $240,000  $490,000  Lighting  $240,000  $490,000  Cost summary of the above noted items is as follows: These costs are based on general assumptions for constructing a 3-sided tunnel structure as described above. This estimate specifically does not include: 1) Cost for the bridge structures 2) Bridge upgrade costs to support the 3-sided structure, if needed 3) Deep foundations if needed for pedestal walls 4) Access doors, emergency exits 5) Ventilation system (see Air Quality Mitigation Memo) 6) Traffic management camera system 7) Unique loading conditions 8) Roadway items – Mass grading, roadway pavements 9) Utility connections to tunnel 10) Contingency 11) Other items not noted above TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM Highway 53 M-1 Alignment Air Quality Mitigation Assessment PREPARED FOR: Roberta Dwyer/MnDOT PREPARED BY: Evan Cobb/CH2M HILL, Carrie MacDougall/CH2M HILL, Don Caniparoli/CH2M HILL, and Baljinder Bassi/CH2M HILL DATE: November 12, 2013 (Revised 12-09-13) 1.1 Background The purpose of this technical memorandum is to assess the feasibility of air quality mitigation measures on the M-1 alternative currently under consideration by the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) as part of the Highway 53 Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) between Virginia and Eveleth. The proposed M-1 route travels through the Cliffs Natural Resources (Cliffs) operated United Taconite mine. As proposed, this route would potentially have mine operations occurring on either side of the highway. There are few instances of a highway passing through an operating mine and thus limited precedent for evaluating resulting business air quality standards compliance issues in such a situation. A concern of this alternative is the potential for exposing the public (travelers on Highway 53) to air that exceeds federal National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for a portion of the highway corridor through the mine. 1.2 Objective and Air Quality Regulatory Factors The objective of this memo is to evaluate options for air quality mitigation that could be implemented by MnDOT on the M-1 route to mitigate the potential NAAQS exposure issues. It is not intended to evaluate or suggest air quality mitigation measures that could be implemented by Cliffs. Key considerations for the analysis of MnDOT’s options for mitigation on M-1 include:  Right-of-way requirements – because the roadway would be running in an elevated position relative to the operating mine, any widening of the highway cross-section would have consequences on the overall project footprint in the mine. As the footprint gets wider, the extent of iron ore that is sequestered (no longer accessible to the mine) is likely to increase as well.  Vertical profile – Highway 53 enters Virginia from the south on a down-gradient slope. Any measures that elevate the road profile would create safety and access issues for entry to south side of Virginia, where a commercial business district and the Riverwood neighborhood are provided access to the highway. Raising the highway could cause the elimination or re-routing of access points. The purpose of this technical memo is to evaluate mitigation options that may allow receptors on US 53 to be within a M-1 alternative corridor that meets ambient air quality standards. One mitigation option is to enclose a segment of proposed Highway 53 in a tunnel or tube (hereafter referred to as an “elevated tunnel”), thereby separating US 53 travelers (receptors) from higher levels of particulate matter generated by mining activities. The following information serves as an analysis of the feasibility issues associated with such a mitigation option.  HIGHWAY 53 M-1 ALIGNMENT AIR QUALITY MITIGATION ASSESSMENT 1.2.1 Mine Air Quality Permitting Based on an air quality modeling culpability analysis performed by Cliffs, their results indicated a potential for exceedance of the 24-hour National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for particulate matter 10 micrometers in size or smaller (PM10) in the M-1 route scenario. The mine’s air quality model has shown that this standard would not be met on the northerly segment of the proposed M-1 alignment. This northern area is most susceptible to PM10 concerns because it is closer to dust generating activities in and around the mine. The modelling analysis conducted by Cliffs Natural Resources indicated a potential for the exceedance of the 24-hour PM10 standard of 150 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) . According to a December 2012 memorandum entitled Consideration of Mitigation Options, the modelling analysis indicated the potential for a NAAQS exceedance at two modelled receptor locations at 24-hour averaged PM10 concentrations of up to 200 µg/m3. These results demonstrate how introducing the M-1 alternative within the United Taconite mine may affect the mine’s ability to meet NAAQS for future permitting. 1.2.2 Additional Regulatory Conditions 1.2.2.1 Background Air Quality The area is classified as attainment for all NAAQS standards, as the surrounding environment is characterized by air quality that is in compliance with national standards. No other air quality issues are anticipated for this project. 1.2.2.2 Mobile Source Air Toxics Mobile Source Air Toxics (MSAT) assessments are required for most federal transportation projects. Based on the example projects defined in the FHWA guidance Interim Guidance Update on Mobile Source Air Toxic Analysis in NEPA dated December 6, 2012, Highway 53 would be classified as a project with Low Potential MSAT Effects. 1.2.2.3 Traffic Analysis The projected average daily traffic volumes of 28,650 vehicles are assumed to not be affected by any of the mitigation alternatives evaluated. Carbon monoxide levels are not a concern at the forecasted traffic volumes for this project; therefore, air quality mitigation discussions will not consider pollution from vehicle traffic. A potential outcome of mitigation analysis is to recommend restrictions on the types of vehicles allowed to travel on the proposed Highway 53 segment. A restriction on vehicles that carry hazardous materials (re-routing vehicles to an alternative roadway) could be implemented with substantial reduction to the cost of mitigation. By eliminating the potential presence of hazardous materials in the tunnel reduces the design fire size, and as a result reduces the scope and cost of implementing emergency air ventilation equipment. Such a restriction is assumed to have a negligible effect on traffic volumes on this segment of Highway 53. 1.2.2.4 National Ambient Air Quality Standards Potential exists for an exceedance of the 24-hr PM10 standard due to nearby mining activity. As this tech memo demonstrates, further analyses are required to determine if an elevated tunnel could adequately protect the road surface from the elevated PM10 levels. 1.3 Mitigation Design Considerations In order to successfully mitigate the high levels of PM10 on the roadway to below the NAAQS, the PM10 loading must be reduced by approximately 25%. Analysis of standard management HIGHWAY 53 M-1 ALIGNMENT AIR QUALITY MITIGATION ASSESSMENT practices at the mine indicate that current efforts at the mine appear to be fully leveraged; therefore, further reduction of PM10 by way of modified mine practices does not appear to be a viable  option for achieving the target reduction. As described above, the proposed M-1 route is subject to a unique environment with substantial limitations to the design and space that it can occupy in the mine. The intent of any proposed mitigation is to prevent ambient air conditions at the roadway to exceed the threshold for PM10. In response to these constraints, the primary method available to make the M-1 route feasible is to create a barrier along the roadway that reduces exposure to particulate matter or creates an environment where the air can be treated to levels below the standard for PM10. Details of the Cliffs modelling analysis have not been made available to MnDOT for review. Based on Cliffs’ presentation of results from their culpability analysis, there is one portion of the M-1 route that is clearly at risk for exceeding the NAAQS threshold (shown with red dots in Figure 1 of the December 2012 memo). There are also portions at either end of the M-1 route that are not at risk for exceeding the PM10 threshold (shown with blue dots in Figure 1). 1.3.1 Mitigation Options Since a reduction in PM10 emissions from a change in mine practices is not a viable mitigation option, only a combination of physical barriers and air filtration equipment were considered. Multiple mitigation options were considered for the proposed route M-1:  Elevated Tunnel o An elevated tunnel spanning the entire length of the permit-to-mine area. Air filtration equipment may not be required. o An elevated tunnel spanning only the permit-to-mine area with the highest PM10 concentrations. Air filtration equipment would likely be required.  Depressed Roadway o A elevated roadway with walls approximately 20’ in height could potentially reduce exposure to elevated PM10 concentrations. The elevated roadway could be shielded from external PM10 sources and create a “depressed roadway”. Air filtration equipment would not be feasible. HIGHWAY 53 M-1 ALIGNMENT AIR QUALITY MITIGATION ASSESSMENT  Non-structural Coverings o An elevated roadway with non-structural coverings (flexible “tarp” shields) above the roadway could potentially reduce exposure to elevated PM10 concentrations. Air filtration equipment would not be feasible. The elevated tunnel mitigation options would involve significant engineering and construction costs as discussed later in this memo; however, the technology used to reduce elevated PM10 levels have been demonstrated as a common and effective technology in transportation projects. The two elevated tunnel lengths as mitigation options contain the least amount of uncertainty and are the focus of this mitigation assessment. The two mitigation options involving an elevated tunnel are referenced as Option 1 and 2 for the remainder of this mitigation assessment. The depressed roadway mitigation option would involve a formal air quality dispersion modeling effort to determine the effectiveness of the heightened walls to shield the elevated roadway from high PM10 concentrations. In addition, the walls would create a depressed roadway that would trigger fire protection safety standards similar to those required in tunnels. Considering depressed roadways require similar fire safety requirements as tunnels and that any improvements in air quality along the roadway are unknown, the wall mitigation concept is likely infeasible and not addressed further in this memo. Non-structural coverings over the elevated roadway were discussed as a means of providing a physical barrier at a reduced cost; however, non-structural elements were deemed an unorthodox solution with potential safety issues. This mitigation option is not addressed further in this memo. 1.3.2 Tunnel Dimensions and Highway Characteristics The M-1 alignment through the United Taconite Mine as described in the EIS would be a four-lane highway consisting of two travel lanes in each direction with traffic volumes projected to be approximately 28,650 vehicles per day. The tunnel would be divided by a central wall to create two tunnel sections with two travel lanes in each side of the tunnel. Typical cross sections indicate the two tunnel sections would be approximately 37’ wide including the travel lanes, median, shoulders, and emergency egress access. There are no intersecting access points within the boundaries of the mine, and no access is possible except from either end of the highway outside the mine limits. The road surface would vary in height from 50 to 100 feet above the current mine surface. An example of how fire protection requirements affect tunnel design is in how egress must be available in the event of a fire inside the tunnel. If the tunnel were designed as one portal opening containing the entire cross-section, provision of emergency egress to an exterior walkway would be necessary. However, by placing a dividing wall at the median with fire doors at regular intervals, the emergency egress would be created by providing two separate tubes, one for each direction of travel. Such a measure is assumed for this scenario, as it helps maintain a smaller cross-section and project footprint in the mine. The tunnel height and width have been determined by various sources cited in the table below; however, two different tunnel lengths are being considered for the air quality mitigation analysis. The table below presents the dimensions of the tunnel for the proposed route as currently known. For planning purposes, the permit to mine length has been assumed. Per the dimensions listed in NFPA 502 (see Attachment B), the range of tunnel lengths available place the tunnel either in the Category “C” or “D” classification (see Table 2). HIGHWAY 53 M-1 ALIGNMENT AIR QUALITY MITIGATION ASSESSMENT TABLE 1 – APPROXIMATE M-1 ROUTE M-1 TUNNEL DIMENSIONS Characteristic  Total/Component  Tunnel Dimension  Source  Height  Total  Standard tunnel section: 17’4” Fan niche section: 24’ = 17’4” + ~6’ (two fan diameter lengths@ 3’ diameter)  Assumption based on providing no less than MnDOT standard 17’4” vehicle clearance in standard tunnel section and approximately 6’ in additional height in niche sections housing tunnel fans and associated equipment.  Width  Total  2 tunnels at 37’ wide each  Assumption based on four lanes of traffic (12’ per lane) and shoulder/emergency egress widths.  Length  Option 1  6,100’ or 1.15 miles(s)  Full permit-to-mine area  from MnDOT (SEH) PDF drawing of road profile: air quality – profile.PDF  Option 2  3,000’ or 0.55 mile(s)  Approximation of diagram for coverage of key area, from: Dec 2012 Consideration of Mitigation Options.PDF from Cliffs Natural Resources  If the entire permit-to-mine area is spanned by the proposed route, the tunnel will cross over two bridges that handle mining vehicles. As discussed previously, it is proposed that a tunnel along the proposed route M-1 would mitigate the high levels of PM10 on the roadway. The proposed route is in a constrained right-of-way area, so any air handling and filtration equipment that may be needed cannot be located adjacent to the roadway as it is desirable to keep the roadway footprint as narrow as possible. Even so, the construction of a tunnel structure is likely to require additional features (such as barriers or foundations) that result in a wider footprint needed than described above. Some of these features may potentially have no impact on the horizontal footprint of the project. Closer analysis of the space requirements would be necessary during more detailed design. 1.3.3 Tunnel Air Management 1.3.3.1 Air Treatment With the air environment as depicted in Exhibit 1, there are two basic treatment options for meeting the air quality mitigation objective with a tunnel concept: 1)  Option 1 – This tunnel length (6,100’) covers the entire permit-to-mine area. The tunnel  portals would be located outside the  area  of elevated PM10  concentrations, and it  assumed that air entering the tunnels would meet all NAAQS standards. As such, the  requirements for air treatment equipment were eliminated.  2)  Option  2  – This  tunnel  length (3,000’)  would  cover  the  area  of  elevated  PM10  concentrations, but the tunnel portals would still be exposed to elevated PM10 levels.  This option would require the installation of an air treatment system capable of reducing  the PM10 concentrations below the NAAQS standards. This option relies on air treatment  equipment and  assumes  that the  area  at risk will not shift due to changes in mine  operations and practices or due to changes in the air quality standard for PM10. In summary, a longer tunnel (Option 1) covering the entire permit-to-mine area would likely not require air filtration equipment that would be needed on the shorter tunnel (Option 2) HIGHWAY 53 M-1 ALIGNMENT AIR QUALITY MITIGATION ASSESSMENT 1.3.3.2 Tunnel Ventilation Ventilation of air through the tunnel would generally be achieved through placement of jet fans inside the tunnel (see Exhibit 2 for a representative tunnel fan arrangement). The presence of jet fans are a requirement of fire protection standards (see Section 1.3.4 below) and for the purposes of this analysis are not considered part of the air quality mitigation strategy for either Option 1 or Option 2. For Option 2, the use of fans ventilating the tunnel can help dilute tunnel air; however, the effects of jet fans on the air filtration equipment were not considered in the cost analysis. For Option 1, the source air is below the threshold and PM10 levels are not expected to be an issue within the tunnel.1 Ventilation would still be a necessary component of any tunnel longer than 1,000 feet in order to respond to potential emergency situations. Carbon monoxide and NOX are also potential concerns of any tunnel environment. Modeling of the tunnel based on the US EPA MOVES analysis methodology would also be required. For the probable tunnel lengths involved in this project, ventilation is likely to be necessary. 1.3.3.3 Fire Safety Fire protection standards for tunnels are provided by National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standard 502. Tunnel length dictates the minimum fire protection standards. Tunnels greater than 3,280 feet (Category “D” tunnels) have the most restrictive standards. Tunnels between 1,000 feet and 3,280 feet long (Category “C”), are subject to nearly the same standards, with some minor differences (see Exhibit 3 at the back of this memo for a summary of the fire protection standards in both categories). Based on the modeling results as depicted in Exhibit 1, the shortest reasonable tunnel length to address the mitigation requirements for the M-1 route is expected to be no less than 1,000 feet.  Potential tunnel safety requirements include fire detection systems, communication systems, traffic control systems, fire protection systems, means of emergency egress from the tunnel, electrical systems, and the creation of an emergency response plan. These items are not related to improving air quality in the tunnel but would add to costs of this alternative and would be in addition to any air filtration improvements needed. These emergency operation standards have the effect of requiring the incorporation of tunnel ventilation features as well. 1.4 Elevated Tunnel Evaluation 1.4.1 Air Treatment Requirements An air cleaning or treatment system in an elevated tunnel would likely be an electrostatic precipitator (ESP), as such systems are commonly used in tunnels and have greater flexibility in the location they can be placed. For instance, an ESP could be installed above the roadway in order to limit the horizontal footprint of the structure. Electrostatic precipitators are commonly used in tunnel systems as they have a capacity to handle large gas volumes (approximately 4 HIGHWAY 53 M-1 ALIGNMENT AIR QUALITY MITIGATION ASSESSMENT million ft3 per minute), high collection efficiencies (90 – 99+%), even for small particle sizes, and require relatively small amounts of energy to run (Wark, Warner, Davis, 1998).2 If the tunnel extends beyond the areas of potentially high PM10, an air cleaning system may not be required specifically for the management of PM10, as the tunnel could adequately shield the roadway surface. An analysis of local wind patterns would be necessary to determine if the tunnel’s orientation would adequately shield the roadway surface. Even if air treatment systems were determined unnecessary, air ventilation systems (such as shown in Exhibit 2) would be needed to ensure a method for air dilution for emergency operations. 1.4.2 Inlet and Outlet Air Volume Requirements (Ventilation) Based on the discussion in Section 1.3.3, it is assumed the elevated tunnel will require ventilation with outside air and that National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for all criteria pollutants will be met inside the tunnel. No modeling was conducted to determine the need for ventilation to manage vehicle emissions in the tunnel. However, with a projection of 28,650 vehicles per day in this segment of Highway 53 over the next twenty years, traffic levels are substantially below standard thresholds for emissions concerns. If modeling were performed, calculations for tunnel ventilation would be based upon the US EPA’s MOVES software program methodology. Factors impacting tunnel ventilation include traffic density, speed, vehicle type, and nitrogen oxides (NOX) and carbon monoxide (CO) dilution requirements. Part of the assessment for fire protection in a tunnel is the determination of a “design fire.” This is based on a variety of factors, most notably the types of vehicles that may pass through a tunnel and the potential for flammable materials within the tunnel. Tunnel characteristics and the fire protection standards will dictate that a ventilation system be put in place. However, there are some measures that when taken would help to limit the expense of the system. For instance, prohibiting the passage of trucks containing hazardous materials or requiring a police escort through the tunnel would help to reduce the design requirements for fire suppression. 1.4.3 Maintenance of an Air Mitigation System Tunnel and system maintenance could include regular tests of fans, emergency call boxes, lighting systems, fire monitoring and protection systems, and any required air filtration and cleaning equipment. Air filtration and cleaning equipment would need to be inspected, calibrated, and cleaned on a regular basis to ensure their proper removal of air pollutants. Given the length of the potential elevated tunnel, there is a high standard given for maintenance of lighting within the tunnel. These maintenance tasks would be in addition to any roadway or tunnel structure maintenance required by MnDOT. The expected life cycle for air handling and filtration equipment is approximately 25-30 years. While replacement costs may not match the initial costs for purchase and installation, substantial replacement of air equipment would be expected at costs similar to initial installation costs. 1.4.4 Cost Analysis A cost analysis has been prepared that covers both capital and operating and maintenance costs for tunnel Option 1 and 2. The scope of the cost analysis was limited to the direct and indirect capital investments and the annual operations and maintenance (O&M) costs of ESP air filtration system and emergency fire protection air ventilation fans. Other aspects of the proposed M-1 2 Fabric filters are another option to treat large volumes of air (approximately 5 million ft3 per minute) and collection efficiencies can exceed 99% over a broad range of particle sizes(Wark, Warner, Davis, 1998). However, project footprint considerations for this Highway 53 project could prohibit the installation of large baghouses given the desire to limit the horizontal footprint. HIGHWAY 53 M-1 ALIGNMENT AIR QUALITY MITIGATION ASSESSMENT route such as the physical tunnel structure, earthwork, drainage, lighting, signage and signalling, construction costs, and utilities were not considered within the scope of this cost analysis. 1.4.4.1 ESP System Cost As discussed in Section 1.4.1, ESP systems are routinely employed as air quality mitigation systems in tunnels. Most ESP systems installed in tunnels consist of small modular units versus large industrial ESPs installed at power plants or manufacturing facilities. The US EPA’s Air Pollution Training Institutes Electrostatic Precipitator Plan Review document gives costing guidance for the purchase and O&M cost for such small modular ESP systems. As discussed previously, an ESP was not considered for the tunnel spanning the entire permit-to-mine area (Option 1). The cost analysis for the ESP system therefore only covers the short tunnel span, Option 2. The total capital cost of the ESP system is a function of the volume of air handled by the system. The tunnel volume was calculated using the dimensions stated in Table 1. The capital cost includes the direct purchase cost of the ESP system and associated auxiliary equipment, installation costs, as well as indirect costs associated with engineering and construction field expenses. The total capital investment for an ESP system for tunnel Option 2 was estimated at approximately $662,000. Annual O&M costs included regular annual maintenance, electricity costs, and recovered dust disposal and were estimated to be approximately $4,800. Indirect annual costs (capital recovery, property taxes, insurance, administrative costs, and overhead) were not considered for this cost analysis. Detailed calculations, assumptions, and associated references used in the cost analysis are included in Appendix D. 1.4.4.2 Emergency Ventilation Cost As discussed in Section 1.3.3.3, emergency ventilation systems would be required for both tunnel Option 1 and 2 under FHPA Standard 502. The fans used for emergency ventilation are large axial turbo fans mounted at the top of the tunnel structure. The fans and their associated electrical systems are required to meet certain performance standards during fire events. As a result of their robust design, these fans, their associated equipment, and their installation are expensive compared to the air quality control equipment. A cost analysis was performed for both tunnel Option 1 and 2. The total capital cost of the emergency ventilation system is a function of the number of fans to be installed in each tunnel. The capital cost includes the direct purchase cost of the fans and associated auxiliary equipment, installation costs, as well as indirect costs associated with engineering and construction field expenses. Fans are typically installed in groups of two and are required to be spaced out along the length of the tunnel as a function of the fan diameter. Option 1 would require approximately 48 fans; whereas, the shorter Option 2 tunnel would require approximately 24 fans. The direct purchase cost of the fans are a fraction of total direct cost as the installation of the associated electrical systems can be one to two times as expensive as the fans themselves. As a result of the substantial installation and design requirements for the fans, the total capital investment for the ventilation system for tunnel Option 1 and 2 were estimated to be $28,000,000 and $14,000,000 dollars, respectively. Annual O&M costs included regular annual maintenance, and electricity costs for tunnel Option 1 and 2 and were estimated to be approximately $55,000 and $28,000, respectively. Indirect annual costs (capital recovery, property taxes, insurance, administrative costs, and overhead) were not considered for this cost analysis. HIGHWAY 53 M-1 ALIGNMENT AIR QUALITY MITIGATION ASSESSMENT Detailed calculations, assumptions, and associated references used in the cost analysis are included in Appendix C and D. 1.5 Summary While the scenario of building an elevated tunnel across an operating mine is unique and with limited applicable case examples to draw from, the technology exists to protect the roadway from PM10 levels that exceed the NAAQS standard. This memo does not attempt to predict or identify an expected response from the MPCA or US EPA in regard to the applicability of this mitigation measure to the air quality permit held by Cliffs Natural Resources at United Taconite. Due to the length of the elevated tunnel considered in Option 1 and 2, fire protection standards become a driving factor in the determination of needed air ventilation and filtration equipment. Table 2 below provides a comparison of the two tunnel lengths, Option 1 and 2, and summarizes the key issues described in this memo. According to the cost analysis performed for tunnel Option 1 and 2, the reduced cost associated with not having an ESP system in the longer Option 1 tunnel is more than offset by the substantial costs associated with emergency ventilation fans required in both tunnel lengths. In discussions with tunnel ventilation experts, it has been determined that route M-1 is technically feasible and could adequately protect the roadway from elevated PM10 levels through the application of proper air handling or filtration equipment; however, there are substantial upfront and ongoing O&M costs associated with achieving this result. References Wark, Warner, and Davis.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) will develop a 2,704 acre expansion to complement the existing Iron Range Off-highway Vehicle Recreation Area (OHVRA), located at Gilbert, Minnesota. This expansion, which was legislatively authorized in 1999, is located about one-mile north of the existing facility, partially within the City of Virginia, Minnesota (See Overview Map -next page). It will be linked to and managed from the existing Gilbert OHVRA facility. Together, the Virginia Expansion and the existing Gilbert Site will total about 3,900 acres. The Virginia site, or project area, will be developed exclusively for trail riding for all classes of Off-highway Vehicles (OHVs)--All-terrain Vehicles (ATVs), Off-highway Motorcycles (OHMs), and Off-road Vehicles (ORVs); ORVs include larger vehicles such as 4x4 trucks and jeeps. When completed, the new road and trail system at Virginia will total approximately 75 miles. Specifically, this expansion project includes the development of a 75-mile road/trail system, two culvert underpasses and perimeter fencing. Little or no built infrastructure is planned for the Virginia Expansion Site. The sole vehicle entrance into the OHVRA will remain on Enterprise Trail, a gravel road approximately .5 miles east of the TH 37 & 135 intersection in Gilbert. This road enters the OHVRA at Pettit Road on the north side just west of the DM&IR railroad tracks. Just inside the gate is a Contact Station and bridge crossing of the DM&IR dual tracks which serves as the primary entrance point into the newly expanded OHVRA. A planned one-mile connector trail will link the two sites. Purpose of this Amendment. An EAW, an EIS, and a Master Plan were previously prepared for the Iron Range OHV Recreation Area, Gilbert Site. This Amendment to the original Recreation Area Master Plan (dated 12/31/98) supplements and updates that plan to incorporate management and development guidance specifically applicable to the Virginia Site Expansion. It incorporates the original Master Plan and environmental documents by reference. Implementation Plans and Construction Schedule. Upon completion of Environment Review, and approval of this Master Plan, this project may proceed with local permitting and construction. After a decade-long delay, funding is finally in-place for facility construction and operations. Construction is expected to take 9-12 months before the site can be opened to public use. Development of the full 75miles of roads, trails and support facilities, however, may not be completed for 3-5 years thereafter. VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page3 VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page4 IRONRANGE OFF-HIGHWAYVEHICLERECREATIONAREA MASTERPLANAMENDMENT VIRGINIAEXPANSION Tableof Contents Page EXECUTIVESUMMARY 3 TABLEOFCONTENTS 5 APPENDICES 6 LISTOFTABLES&FIGURES 7 I.

BACKGROUND. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) will develop a 2,704 acre expansion to complement the existing Iron Range Off-highway Vehicle Recreation Area (IROHVRA), located at Gilbert, Minnesota. The expansion site is located one mile north of the existing IROHVRA, partially within the City of Virginia, Minnesota. The Virginia Expansion site will be managed out of the existing facility, which will be linked to the expansion area by a connector road. This proposed expansion includes the development of the connector road, a core trail system, vehicle specified trails, and perimeter fencing. The proposed Virginia Off-highway Vehicle Recreation Area (OHVRA), hereafter referred to as the Virginia Expansion site, Virginia site, or project area, is located in two cities--partially on the eastern limits of the City of Virginia and partially on the northern limits of the City of Gilbert (Figures 1 & 3 – Appendix D). The site will be developed for trail riding for all classes of Off-highway Vehicles (OHVs)-All-terrain Vehicles (ATVs), Off-highway Motorcycles (OHMs), and Off-road Vehicles (ORVs); ORVs are the class of larger sized vehicles that includes 4x4 trucks and jeeps. When completed, the road and trail system would run a distance of approximately 75 miles. The 2,704 acre-Virginia Expansion site will be connected to the existing 1,200 acre-Gilbert OHVRA by a connector trail that will serve as its only public access. Together, the Virginia Expansion and the existing Gilbert Site will total about 3,900 acres. B. PROJECT PURPOSE, SCOPE & CONTEXT. This 2,704-acre addition to the Iron Range OHV Recreation Area (OHVRA) was legislatively authorized in 1999 (Minnesota Session Laws, 1999, Chapter 231, Sect. 99, Subd. 4). The addition was intended to complement off-road riding opportunities already available at Gilbert, making the OHVRA a viable long-distance destination and an attractive, challenging recreation experience for trail riders. The OHVRA, which has been operating at Gilbert since 2002, was always intended to include sufficient acreage and trail riding opportunity to attract riders from across the state and nation. The Virginia Expansion project will help achieve this vision. With nearly 300,000 registered OHVs in Minnesota, OHV riders are a fast-growing constituency. Project beneficiaries include those that already visit the Gilbert Site (about 10,000/yr), and the projected 5,000 additional visitors expected annually following the park’s expansion. When completed, the entire facility will be open to all types of All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs), Off-Highway Motorcycles (OHMs), and Off-Road Vehicles (ORVs). This activity is expected to generate up to $300,000 annually in added economic stimulus for area businesses. Since the Gilbert facility opened in 2002, initial visitor and economic projections have proven accurate and substantial development and new economic activity have occurred in the City of Gilbert. VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page8 C.

PLANNING PROCESS & PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. An EAW, an EIS, and a Master Plan (citation below), were all previously completed for the Iron Range OHV Recreation Area at Gilbert. This amendment is intended to supplement the facility’s original Master Plan by providing management and development guidance specifically applicable to the Virginia Expansion Site. The original Master Plan may be cited as follows: State of Minnesota, Dept of Natural Resources, 1998. “Iron Range OHV Recreation Area: Facility Design, Development and Management Plan”. Master Plan prepared pursuant to Minn. Laws 1996, Chapter 407 and MN Stat. Chapt. 86A.05. St. Paul, MN 55155. 142 Pages plus attachments. VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page9 Planning for the Virginia Expansion began immediately following legislative authorization of this site in 1999. The Site Design Sub-Committee spearheaded the development of conceptual site use plans which were subsequently reviewed and approved by both the DNR Technical Team, and by the 16member Local Area (Citizen’s) Advisory Committee (LAAC). Advisory Committee meetings were duly noticed and open to the public. [See Appendix C for a chronological list of public meeting dates.] After a promising start, planning ground to a halt in late 2000 due to mining concerns stemming from the discovery of economically viable mineral deposits within the boundaries of the authorized expansion area. After a 10-year hiatus, and several legislative boundary changes to the authorized parcel, planning began again in February 2008. Following public approval of the Conceptual Site Design in early 2009, this proposal was subjected to mandatory Environmental Review. In late 2009, a Environmental Assessment Worksheet (EAW) was prepared and publicly reviewed. The EAW was subsequently deemed adequate by MN DNR (the Responsible Governmental Unit). [See Appendix E for the Project EAW, and Appendix F for the EAW Adequacy Decision Document – not attached]. Implementation Plans and Construction Schedule. Upon completion of Environment Review, and approval of this Master Plan, this project may proceed with local permitting and construction. After a decade-long delay, funding is in-place and earmarked for facility construction. Construction is expected to take 9-12 months before the site can be opened for public use. Development of the full 75-miles of roads, trails and support facilities may not be completed for 3-5 years thereafter. VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page10 II. AFFECTEDENVIRONMENT A.SOCIAL&ECONOMICSETTING. Mining History. Despite years of trying to diversify, the economy of Northeastern Minnesota is still dependent upon its vast natural resources. More than one-half of the region's economic output is tied to just nine industries dominated by iron mining, wood and paper production. While the regional economy still relies heavily on timber and taconite, total employment has shifted somewhat towards service sector jobs. And, while the mills and mines aren't hiring as many people as they once did, payroll, fuel, taxes and ore production remain at or above historical levels. The region today contains many active and inactive open-pit mines, underground mines, ore stockpiles, tailings basins, and many small mining towns. About 152 square miles of land in total have been disturbed by mining on the state’s Mesabi Iron Range. It currently supplies two-thirds of the iron ore used to make steel in the United States. A total of 3.5 billion tons of natural ore, in total, have been mined from the Mesabi Range. About 15 million tons of ore were removed from mines located on or adjacent to the OHVRA site. Mining continues to dominate regional income and full-time employment, and plays a significant role in determining population and settlement patterns, work routines, and in defining community identity. Quad Cities. The so-called 'Quad Cities' of Gilbert, Virginia, Mountain Iron and Eveleth owe their origins to the discovery of iron ore, and their growth to eastern capital and immigrant labor. Mountain Iron traces its origins to the discovery of iron in 1890 at the famous Mountain Iron Mine. Although a great ore producer, the mine closed in 1908 due to water seepage, and it was succeeded by several smaller mining operations. In 1942, the mine reopened and subsequently produced millions of tons of ore for the war effort. Depleted, it closed for good in 1956 and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Today, Mountain Iron is home to the giant Minntac Plant, the largest taconite producer in Minnesota. Ore was discovered in the Virginia Area in 1892. By year's end, Virginia was an organized village connected by rail to surrounding communities. Destroyed by fire in 1893, the town was rebuilt and reorganized as a city only to be partially burned again in 1900. Supported by lumbering and mining, the town grew in size and importance and became known regionally as the "Queen City of the Mesabi Range". In 1997, its main street, Chestnut Street, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places as a ‘Historic Commercial District’. Although iron ore was discovered at Eveleth in 1892, the town was not incorporated until 1893. In 1895, ore was discovered beneath the town and it had to be moved. A new site, platted to the east, was established and by 1900 the town of 1,500 was moved a quarter mile uphill where it stands today. Gilbert is the youngest of the Quad Cities. Its roots can be traced to Sparta, a mining community platted in 1896 on a rolling hillside sloping gently to Ely Lake. Sparta grew to 1,000 residents, but having been platted over a rich ore body it was sold to a mining company. In 1908, most of the buildings were moved to the present-day Gilbert site, a new townsite incorporated on 2,240 acres of both platted and unsettled territory. In 1909, the village, which described itself as the "City of Destiny", was re-incorporated -this time including only 143 acres within its boundaries. VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page11 B.NATURALRESOURCEELEMENTS. Topography. Regional topography is primarily the result of mining activity. Much of this site is defined by mine pits, dumps, tailings basins and ore piles. Unmined areas are characterized by gently rolling hills separated by small stream valleys. The land surface slopes gently towards the southeast. The small east-west trending knob on the property is surrounded by wetlands. The marsh on the south side of the knob is an intermittent stream and tributary of the Pike River. The Mesabi Trail, which was built on a former railroad grade, runs along the south project boundary and parallels another small ridge line. Landscape Characteristics. This project is located within the Nashwauk Uplands subsection of the Mixed Laurentian Forest Province that extends across northeastern Minnesota and eastward across the Great Lakes Region. The landscape ranges from rugged lake-dotted terrain with thin glacial deposits over bedrock to hummocky or undulating plains with deep glacial drift, to large, flat poorly drained peat lands. Landforms include end moraines, outwash plains and lake plains. Soils are varied and range from medium to course in texture. Forest communities are dominated by white pine, red pine, balsam fir, white spruce and aspen-birch. Forestry, mining and outdoor recreation are all very important land uses in the Nashwauk Uplands subsection. Soils. The soils in the Virginia Expansion site are defined into two general groups; those in a relatively undisturbed state and those altered by iron mining activities. Soils data compiled by the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) of Northern St. Louis County was used to prepare the Soil Survey Map (Figure 5–Soils Map). Each soil map unit consists of one or more different soil types. A soil type is defined by dominant soil characteristics such as texture, color, structure, and parent material. There are 29 soil map units delineated in the project area (Table 4). The native soils, about seventy percent of the project area, are light-colored, well-drained cobbly and stony loam to sandy loam. Typically, eight to fourteen inches of loamy surface materials (loam or silt loam textures) cover clayey substrates. Nearly one-half of the project area is well drained, one-third is poorly drained, and the rest, including mine dumps and pits, is mixed and variable. Open pit iron ore mining operations south of the Laurentian Divide involved the excavation and disposal of glacial overburden. Approximately thirty percent of the project area consists of mine ‘pits’, ‘dumps’ and ‘tailings,’ which are composed of an assortment of overburden piles, low-grade and reject ore piles, and other waste rock. Overburden dumps are located in Sections 10 and Section 3, north and east of the divide. The ‘mine dumps’ are relatively flat-topped linear embankments dumped there by rail cars. These embankments, composed of primarily silt, clay and sand, form dike-like structures from 20 to 80 feet thick across the natural land surface. Vegetative Cover Types. The Virginia site contains both mined land and natural landscapes which contain a variety of vegetation types ranging from lowland grass and brush to mature stands of aspen, pine and upland hardwoods (Table 1 and Figure 4 – Vegetative Cover Type Map). Stands of upland shrub and aspen-birch cover over fifty-six percent of the project area. Lowland or wetland vegetative types cover an additional nineteen percent of the project area. Fourteen percent of the site is composed of upland deciduous stands, grasslands, or coniferous stands, including jack pine-red pine cover. The remaining portion is classified as a disturbance category containing roads, trails, and mine lands. VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page12 Table1.

The USGS topographic map (Figure 2–USGSTopo)provides a general perspective on the location and extent of wetlands found in the project area. Wetlands occupy fourteen percent of the project area (385 ac.). Hydric soil delineations and hydric/non-hydric soil complexes cover about 640 acres or 24% of the site (Figure 5 – Soils Map). Lowland or wetland vegetative cover types are estimated to cover nineteen percent of the project area (Table 1). The following wetland types were identified using the NWI maps, large-scale aerial photography, and topographical maps. Table2.

The Laurentian Watershed Divide crosses the project area and forms the boundary of two major drainage systems, Hudson Bay and Lake Superior. The Pike River watershed that is part of the Hudson Bay watershed is located on the east side of the divide and the East Two Rivers River watershed that is part of the Lake Superior watershed is on the west side. The Pike River watershed constitutes about forty percent of the watershed of Lake Vermilion. The west and parts of both the south and north sides of the project site have been impacted by mining. The eastern portion of the site features steep topography with relief up to 150-feet, is naturally vegetated, and remains as a relatively undisturbed woodland and wetland complex. The eastern portion of the project area forms part of the headwaters of the Pike River. The Pike River and two unnamed tributaries are classified as MDNR Protected Waters. The Pike River begins in the eastern ½ of Sec. 22, T58N, R17W just south of the project site. It enters the project area in the northwest corner of Sec. 23 and continues through the center of Sec. 14 and the southeast corner of Sec.11 before exiting along the eastern boundary of the project area (seeFigure2–QuadMap). One unnamed tributary to the Pike River, a classified protected waters, flows from southwest to east, then to about the center of Sec.14 of T58N, R17W and its confluence with Pike River. The other unnamed classified protected waters tributary flows from north to south along the east section line of Sec. 11 to its confluence with Pike River. There are three other unnamed tributaries to Pike River that are not classified as protected, however they do flow into the unnamed protected tributaries described above. All of these Pike River tributaries are shown on the U.S.G.S. topographic quad map (Figure2–USGSTopoMap). The Pike River is a warmwater stream that flows through wetlands and has bottom substrates predominantly composed of muddy or organic sediments interspersed with rock and in-stream vegetation. Overhanging vegetation and wetland shrubs dominate the riparian areas. The water flowing from wetlands carries natural tannins, giving the Pike River a tea-colored stain. The western portion of the project area flows westward into the mine pits (Mesabi Mountain Pit Pond), then southward into the East Two Rivers River, a tributary of the St. Louis River and the Lake Superior watershed. A small portion of the area’s watershed drains via ditches either south and around Virginia into a tributary of Manganika Lake (DNR #69-0726P) or westward through Virginia and into Silver Creek, a tributary of the East Two Rivers River. There are no public water lakes in the project area. There are several small, unnamed open water basins that occur mostly at the edge or toe of stockpiles from previous mining activity. Many of these ponds have likely been created or otherwise influenced by mining activity. Fisheries & Wildlife Resources. This project involves potential trail crossings of both the Pike River and two unnamed tributaries, which are state public waters regulated by the MDNR. MDNR’s Division of Waters and Section of Fisheries have been consulted regarding appropriate impact avoidance measures needed to reduce potential stream crossing impacts. Specific riparian area protections are outlined in the sections that follow. Fish species identified during sampling (2003) of the Pike and Sandy Rivers are shown in Table 2. VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page14 Table3. FishSpeciesofthePikeandSandyRivers,Summer2003.

Most of the area’s inhabitants are tolerant of disturbance. Mining History. This site lies over a portion of the Biwabik Iron Formation, geologically referred to as the ‘Virginia Horn’. The western one-third of the area has an extensive mining history, including both underground and open pit mines. Mining of natural ores began in 1893 and continued until 1976 at the Minnewas Mine, which was located in the southwestern portion of the Virginia site. The nearby Rouchleau Annex was subsequently mined until 1986. As a result, the western part of the Virginia site is composed of ‘auxiliary mining lands,’ which contain surface waste rock dumps and lean ore stockpiles. The eastern part of the site is relatively unaffected by mining or other developments. See also Figs 3 & 8, Appendix DThe site is bordered on the west by the Missabe Mountain, Minnewas, Sauntry and Rouchleau open mine pit operations. The St. Louis County Maintenance Facility and State Highway 135 is located south of the Virginia site. The Ispat Inland Mining Company’s main haul road leading to the (active) Laurentian Mine is near the eastern border of the site. Ispat Inland’s Minorca Pit and taconite pelletizing plant is north of the site. The Mine’s haul road and pelletizing plant are operated continuously throughout the year. The park’s connector road/trail will travel under this haul road. Landscape Effects. Open pit mining operations south of the Laurentian Divide resulted in the removal and disposal of large quantities of overburden and waste rock. This overburden consists of glacial materials excavated by ‘steam-shovel’ methods from above the iron-bearing deposits of the Rouchleau, Missabe Mountain and Sauntry Mine operations beginning in the early 1920’s. VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page15 Materials transported by rail to the other side of the divide were dumped from open rail cars in Sections 3, 10 and 15 of Township 58N Range 17W. This produced linear embankments of imported glacial material. The initial placement of the linear piles were placed side-by-side across the original topographic surface, in a southwest-to-northeast direction. Subsequent layers of material were dumped in linear embankments tending east to west in the east half of Section 3 and northwest to southeast in the northeast corner of Section 10. Rail cars entered the disposal area from the northwest corner of Section 10. At least three additional levels of overburden were deposited atop the original dump materials. Overburden material was primarily dumped in Sections 3 and 10. Waste rock that covered the ore formations consisted of a mix of glacial sediments and Upper Cretaceous age siltstones. It was dumped primarily in Section 15, although some was also dumped in Section 10. The eastern portion of the Virginia site are mineral reserve lands on an unaltered landscape that includes a portion of the Pike River headwaters, two tributaries, wetlands and forested uplands. Future Mining Prospects. Despite its mining history, this site still contains significant taconite reserves. As stipulated in authorizing legislation, mining can occur in conjunction with this planned recreational development. Consequently, very little built infrastructure is proposed for this site. The taconite reserves will remain available for future mining without encumbrance from the newly expanded OHVRA or related developments. Any future decision to mine the so-called ‘East Virginia Reserves’ will depend upon a variety of factors, including taconite prices, pellet supply and demand, business plans, land and mineral ownership, water quality issues, and other variables. C. LAND-USEELEMENT. 1. Current Conditions. The western portions of the Virginia Expansion feature inactive mines that consist mainly of re-vegetated mine dumps or waste rock stockpiles. The northwest portion of the site is an active gravel mine that will eventually be reclaimed as part of the Virginia OHVRA (Fig. 3, Detail Map). The eastern portion of the Virginia site are mineral reserve lands on an unaltered landscape that includes part of the upper Pike River watershed, associated wetlands, and forested uplands. The planned connector trail begins at the northeast corner of the existing Gilbert OHVRA where it joins an existing OHV trail on the south side of State Highway 135. Solid Waste Facilities. In the center of the Virginia Site lies a sizable exclusion area in Sections 3, 10, and 11. This area serves as St. Louis County’s Regional Landfill and recycling facility. A paved haul road connects this 920-acre facility with State Highway 135 near the southwest corner of the expansion site. The southwest portion of Sec. 15 was excluded from the project area due to its use as a former Mesabi Regional Landfill Authority dumpsite, which has been sealed and is presently monitored by MPCA through a series of test wells. Discussions are underway with MPCA to allow for some limited OHV use of approximately 150 acres adjacent to this former dumpsite in the west half of Section 15. Usage of this and other areas peripheral to the dump site and proximal to the site boundary will be investigated for possible future use and/or incorporation into the OHVRA. Other. Four non-industrial private properties totaling 90-acres are located within the site’s statutory boundary. All are seasonal recreational properties; only two have buildings. Screening and fencing will be provided, where necessary to ensure that trespass or disturbance to these private property VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page16 owners is avoided. The MDNR is unaware of any liquid or natural gas pipelines, or any other potential environmental hazards, located within the primary project area (Fig.3–DetailMap). The MDNR will manage this area within the administrative and policy constructs established in state law and rule. State Recreation Areas (SRA’s), like the OHVRA, are actively managed to provide a range of goods and services, and can host a mix of commercial, industrial and resource management activities, including timber harvest, mining, tree planting, and both motorized and non-motorized forms of outdoor recreation. Recreational vehicle use of this site is generally compatible with surrounding commercial, seasonal recreational, and industrial land-uses. 2. Scenic & Aesthetic Features. This landscape has been dramatically altered by the extraction of iron ore and the creation of man-made lakes, ore stockpiles, overburden piles, tailings basins and impoundments. Vegetation in mined areas was also removed, but has largely re-established itself with the aid of reclamation efforts. Visual scars are beginning to heal, except in the areas where active mining or commercial gravel operations continues. The OHVRA does not lie within a scenic travel corridor, nor are there any designated byways or viewsheds requiring special protection. High stockpiles and dumps (some up to 125 feet tall) are visible for some distance, however, and do warrant special consideration. Overlook areas will be developed in the project area to complement the core trail system and individual trail networks. The overlook areas will take advantage of the impressive views from the top of 125’+ tall mine dumps. Scenic vistas and overlooks will be set-back a safe distance from overlooks to ensure visitor safety. They will also be visually unobtrusive from the surrounding area. 3. RecreationalOpportunity. St. Louis County is home to 5 State Parks (9,839 acres), 7 SNAs (7,918 acres), and 16 WMAs (6,606 acres). These DNR Units are generally closed to motorized recreational use. In addition, about 325,234 acres of the 1,096,187 acre federal BWCAW are located in St. Louis County. The BWCAW also includes 31,284 acres of DNR forest lands in St. Louis County, including all or portions of the Burntside, Bear Island, Kabetogama and Lake Jeanette State Forests. All state and federally-owned lands within the BWCAW are closed to motor vehicle use. Cross-country OHV travel on both state and federal lands is also prohibited, except on state lands pursuant to MS Chapt. 84.926 (i.e., seasonal hunter / trapper exceptions). State Forests, and the 539,067 acres of US Forest Service administered lands outside the BWCAW in St. Louis County do provide a number of miles of roads and trails open to OHV use. Vehicular trails and travel routes on state lands are mapped and available at www.mndnr.gov. A number of state-funded grant-in-aid routes and other trails are described below. On federal lands, motor routes are mapped on the Superior National Forest’s website at http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/forests/superior/. The Moose GIA Trail is a planned seven-mile ATV/Off-Highway Motorcycle (OHM) Trail that will connect the City of Biwabik to the Iron Range OHVRA at Gilbert. The trail, currently under construction, is being developed primarily along an existing snowmobile trail corridor. The trail was originally constructed by the East Range ATV/Snowmobile Club with a grant from Iron Range Resources. It first opened during the 2004-05 winter season. This same club has initiated efforts to open the corridor to use by ATV riders during the snow-free season (Fig. 8–Trails In Project Area). The Moose Trail’s proximity to the OHVRA will enable DNR Staff to easily and routinely monitor trail use and trail conditions. Eventually it will provide riders with a connection to the OHVRA, to area VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page17 lodging, camping and support services located nearby. This legal access should also discourage private property trespass and reduce ditch riding in the vicinity of the OHVRA. Mesabi Mountain GIA Trail entails development of a 4.1-mile trail designed for use by registered Off-Road Vehicles (ORVs) only. This jeep trail will begin just east of the Mesabi Range Community and Technical College in Eveleth and travel northeast for the four-mile distance through public and private lands (Fig. 8 – Trails In Project Area). The difficult terrain and ledge-rock provides an opportunity to create a challenging ORV trail rated “most-difficult” for experienced drivers. This two-directional trail (not a loop) will provide OHVRA visitors with added local riding opportunity. Genoa ATV/ OHMTrail provides a direct connection from the City of Eveleth to the City of Gilbert, starting at the Highway 53 and Highway 37 intersection in Eveleth and ending at the Sherwood Forest Campground in Gilbert. It is a gravel-surfaced trail approximately 3.5 miles in length open only to ATVs and OHMs. Since 2005, it has provided a vital off-road link between the Iron Range OHVRA and hotels and restaurants in the City of Eveleth (Fig.8–TrailsInProjectArea). The Mesabi Trail is a paved hike/bike (non-motorized) trail that connects the communities of Grand Rapids, Coleraine, Bovey, Taconite, Marble through Calumet and Pengilly, Nashwauk, Keewatin, Hibbing, Chisholm, Buhl, Kinney, Mountain Iron, Virginia, Gilbert, Sparta, Fayal, Eveleth and McKinley. Construction continues with paving of a 3.5 mile link between McKinley and Biwabik during the summer of 2009. The Mesabi Trail winds through both the Gilbert and Virginia portions of the Iron Range OHV Recreation Area. 4. Transportation Systems. The City of Gilbert is located in central St. Louis County on TH 37 just east of State Highway 53 and Eveleth, Minnesota (Fig.1–LocationMap). Gilbert is served by major arterials TH 37 (N-S) and TH 135 (E-W) which meet at the north end of town. The Gilbert portion of the OHVRA lies entirely within the Gilbert City Limits just across Lake Ore-be-gone. The OHVRA (at Gilbert) is bordered on the south by County State Aid Highway (CSAH) 97 and on the east by the Gilbert-Fayal Township dividing line, which also defines the Gilbert City Limits. Chestnut Street is a north-south gravel road just 1/2 mile inside of Fayal Township. OHVRAAccess Road The only public entrance into the OHVRA is on Enterprise Trail, a gravel road approximately .5 miles east of the TH 37 & 135 intersection in Gilbert. This route, which is shared with Mesabi Bituminous Co., accesses the OHVRA at Pettit Road on the north side just west of the DM&IR railroad tracks. Enterprise Trail is also used by area residents who hunt, fish and ride OHV trails along the east side of Lake Ore-be-gone. Once inside the gates of the OHVRA, there is a Contact Station and bridge crossing of the DM&IR dual tracks which serves as the primary entrance point (for both Gilbert and Virginia). A rear gate on Chestnut Street is open only to official vehicles, and may be used as an emergency vehicle access. An off-road trail along Dakota Avenue connects the OHVRA entrance with the Sherwood Forest Campground in City of Gilbert. This trail is signed and maintained by DNR in cooperation with the City of Gilbert. This important recreational vehicle trail also links to the Genoa ATV/OHM Trail which provides a direct (off-road) connection between Eveleth and Gilbert. ExistingTraffic Volumes VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page18 TH 37 is the principal arterial serving urbanized Gilbert. The Average Daily Traffic count (or ADT) for TH 37 from Gilbert's western city limits to Alaska Avenue is 3,650 vehicles, 175 of which are classified as 'heavy' vehicles. TH 135 is the primary east-west arterial. ADT counts for TH 135 east of TH 37 are 4,350 vehicles, including 325 heavy vehicles. West of TH 37 the ADT on TH 135 is 6,400 with 310 heavy vehicles. County Road 97, east of CSAH 96 has an ADT count of 980, and between TH 37 and CSAH 96 the average daily traffic count is 1,900. Traffic volumes and road conditions in the Gilbert Area are considered to be within normal design standards and operating capacities by the St. Louis County Traffic Engineer. III. FACILITYDESIGN&DEVELOPMENTPLAN A.FACILITYDESIGNPLAN. 1. Conceptual Development Plan. This project consists of five principal developments: 1) the connector trail (one-mile), 2) two vehicle underpasses, 3) the core trail system (about eight miles), 4) a series of vehicle-specified trail networks (about 66 miles) and 5) perimeter fencing. The new connector trail will exit the existing Iron Range OHVRA and travel north through planned culverts under both State Hwy 135 and Arcelor Mittal’s primary haul road (Fig.4–ConnectorTrailDetail). The connector trail and core trail system will be constructed to serve as multi-use arterials suited for both Off-highway vehicle (OHV) and Highway Licensed Vehicle (HLV) travel. The connector road and the core trail system will range in width from 12 to 20 feet, have a high load bearing capacity, and will be constructed to forest road standards. The trail networks will be developed along new corridors and will be constructed to specifically accommodate each class of OHV. The vehicle-specified trail networks will be built to specifications and sizes appropriate for the size of vehicles within each class [i.e., 24” for Off-highway Motorcycles (OHMs); 72” for All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs); and 108” for Off-Road Vehicles (ORVs)]. In certain cases, however, where major grading and trail bed work is required, construction corridors must first be widened to 10 to 12 feet in order to accommodate standard (full-sized) trail construction equipment. The core trail system and the areas proposed for the series of vehicle-specified trail networks are shown in Figures3&4. The final location of the roads and trails will be determined using trail siting criteria that: 1) Make maximum use of existing disturbed corridors, 2) Select new corridors that are judged to be sustainable and suitable for their intended purpose, and that 3) Minimize negative effects on the site’s natural resources. Wetlands, riparian areas, shoreland zones and other low-lying areas will be generally avoided, as will steep hills, rocky cliffs (except for access to overlooks) and upland areas of dense or unbroken vegetation. Large overstory trees will also be avoided to the extent possible. 2. Vehicle Access & Site-Use Plans. Public access to the facility will be via Enterprise Trail to Petit Road and through the main gate/contact station located in Gilbert. No access will be allowed from the City of Virginia, or from the connector trail that links the Gilbert and Virginia portions of the park. Signing, fencing, gating and enforcement will ensure that visitors always use the main gate. The OHV trails on the Virginia site will be designed using MN DNR’s recently published “Trail Planning, Design and Development Guidelines for Sustainable Trail Development (MDNR 2006). Trail construction techniques will also be strongly influenced by local site conditions (e.g., vegetation, terrain, soil types), the presence of surface waters and/or wetlands, and by pre-existing roads, trails, railgrades or other travel corridors located on the site. VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page19 3. Day-Use & Support Facilities. Throughout the trail system, points of interest, such as overlooks, scenic vistas, pull-offs, picnic/rest areas, and day-use sites will be developed to enhance visitor experiences at the Virginia site. Some of the proposed overlooks are shown on the project maps (Fig. 3 & Fig. 4). Other areas may be developed as new opportunities arise or new trails are constructed. Future development will be limited mostly to areas previously disturbed by construction activities or other areas that can be developed with little disturbance or impact. 4. Berms, Buffers, Fences and Boundaries. Highway barrier fencing, similar to that used at the Gilbert Site, will be used to prevent uncontrolled public ingress or egress along most of the park’s boundaries. Barrier fencing will not be placed in wetlands, riparian areas, or other areas where installation might impact natural resource values. This barrier fence is a recycled product that resists damage and has proven effective at preventing unlawful entry into the park and trespass (intentional or otherwise) onto neighboring properties by park visitors. Since 2002, this fencing has proven very effective in discouraging unlawful activity. B.OPERATIONSELEMENT. 1. Policies & Operating Procedures. The Iron Range OHVRA, which opened in 2002, is presently operated year-round during daylight hours, with a reduced operating scheduling during winter months. The facility is closed during the annual firearms deer season. There is no fee for admission, except for attendance at some special events. The sole public entrance to the OHVRA is via State Highway 135 off Enterprise Trail to Pettit Road (in the City of Gilbert). 2.Public Safety&Inspections. Registered vehicles that possess the required safety equipment, mufflers and spark arrestors will be admitted if they comply with applicable sound regulations (ATVs = 99dB(A) and OHMs = 96 or 99 dB(A), depending upon the year manufactured, using the Standard SAE 1287 sound test). All vehicles must be equipped with standard manufacturer-supplied noise suppression equipment. Vehicle checks are conducted at the main gate. Random spot-checks will also be conducted to ensure that noise suppression devices are not altered after gaining entrance to the park. 3.Monitoring,MaintenanceandEnforcement. Trail Monitoring & Maintenance. The objective is to keep trails sustainable and minimize unwanted soil compaction, displacement, erosion or damage to living vegetation. Designated riding trails may be closed temporarily following heavy precipitation events, for regular maintenance, or for emergency rehabilitation or repairs. All active use areas will be fenced. Signage and barriers will also help prevent unlawful entry, trespass or unauthorized off-trail riding. Trail treadway conditions will be regularly monitored for debris, fallen limbs, washouts, rutting, and vegetative conditions. Trail signage and support structures (e.g., culverts, bridges, drainage devices, retention ponds) will also be periodically inspected to ensure that they are functioning properly and in good working condition. Specific maintenance prescriptions will depend upon local site conditions, soil types, traffic levels, and other factors. Vegetation Management. Vegetation along the trail will be managed to maintain a ‘clearance zone’ and to preserve the integrity of the trail surface. This includes removal of encroaching vegetation by VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page20 cutting and/or spraying of an approved herbicide by a licensed applicator. Vegetation along trails will be maintained and restored if damaged or destroyed. Monitoring/Inspection Schedule. Trail monitoring and inspection will occur regularly throughout the year to detect potential maintenance issues before unsustainable conditions or safety concerns arise. Table 4 provides suggested inspections for each season of the year. Table4. VegetativeCoverTypes–VirginiaOHVRecreationArea. (MDNR,Parks&Trails,2009) InspectionSchedule  Routine inspections are necessary to stay on top of maintenance issues and to address potential problems at an early stage. The following suggests an overall seasonal approach to inspections.  Season  InspectionFocus  Spring  Inspect for damage from winter season use and freeze-thaw cycles. Check for erosion, plugged culverts, vehicle-caused damage, unauthorized uses, and other visible signs of tread imperfections. Record problems and schedule maintenance on a priority basis. Stabilize tread and clear debris from the trails as soon as possible in the spring.  Summer  Conduct daily/weekly inspections to keep trail in safe, usable condition. Inspect vegetative growth and encroachment. Pay special attention to erosion issues, drainageways, and ditches that receive heavy spring runoff. Record all problems and fixes, and schedule needed maintenance on a priority basis.  Fall  Conduct ongoing inspections to keep trails in a safe, usable condition. Focus on maintenance issues that must be taken care of before winter to avoid added damage during spring thaw. Special focus on tread dips, drainage crossings, culverts, and drainageways that must be operational in order to handle spring runoff.  Winter  Inspect low areas and drainages that cannot be easily accessed during summer. This includes culverts, ditches, water crossings and beaver ponds.  Controlling Invasive Species. Preventing the spread of invasive plants is a major concern for resource managers. Trails staff should become familiar with these species and contemporary practices for controlling their spread. Best management practices and departmental policy related to controlling invasive species is available in the Div. of Parks & Trails’ Appendix to DNR Operational Order 113. Enforcement. The DNR’s Enforcement Officers are responsible for enforcing regulations at the Iron Range OHVRA. They may be assisted by state or local officers on occasion, or even by ‘Trail Ambassadors’. These trained, certified volunteers may help monitor activity in the OHVRA, but since they are not licensed peace officers they cannot detain or arrest suspected violators. They can help educate trail users, give minor aid in emergencies, and provide useful information about OHV trails and the responsibility of those who use them. At the conclusion of each shift, Trail Ambassadors complete a ‘Daily Trail Log’. These logs are collected, filed and observations are shared with affected MN DNR divisions. Enforcement issues, for example, are forwarded to local Conservation Officers for follow-up. Good communications with local and state enforcement agencies is critical to lasting success. The Off Highway Vehicle (OHV) Safety Enforcement Grant Program, administered by DNR Enforcement, provides grants to County Sheriff’s Offices and local agencies to assist with OHV enforcement. Grant funds are available to assist with officer training, rider safety training, and field enforcement activity. Funds are available to local enforcement authorities in the vicinity of the Iron Range OHVRA to intensify enforcement monitoring and patrol activity. VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page21 C. PROGRAMMING&VISITORSERVICES. 1. Visitor Services. Upon arrival, visitors need to quickly orient themselves to the park, and locate essential services (e.g., telephone, rest rooms, contact station, vehicle testing area). Visitors also require information regarding emergency and support services (e.g., emergency medical assistance, gasoline, food, lodging, restrooms, campgrounds, vehicle towing and repair services). A comprehensive map of the park and guide to local public services will be provided upon arrival, and displayed publicly at conveniently located information kiosks within the park. Trail User Orientation. Trail user orientation is important so that visitors make informed choices regarding potential trail destinations, travel times, required skill level and equipment, and the type of recreational opportunities they might expect. Riders must also understand park rules and regulations. Visitor information will be included on maps, in printed brochures, on web links, and is displayed on information boards at parking/staging areas, at trail junctions and along most major access roads. Locational and directional signing, once inside the facility, helps visitors orient themselves, and enables emergency personnel to quickly locate distressed vehicles or visitors. Mile markers, maps and signing of all road and trail crossings (even water crossings) are also helpful in this regard. Interpretation. Natural and cultural resources of interest include lakes, rivers, bluffs, wetlands, mine pits and dumps, tailings basins, forested and riparian areas. Providing interpretive information adds to the overall visitor experience, and fosters a sense of stewardship. Interpretive displays will be developed in consultation with other DNR divisions and the Minnesota Historical Society to ensure accuracy. Staff and volunteers can add a uniquely valuable dimension to the recreation area experience through formal or informal visitor contacts. They can greet visiting groups and individuals, answer questions, or provide information, even present audio-visual shows or give tours of the facility. 2. Safety Training & Volunteer Programs. The OHVRA provides a safe, well-maintained recreational facility with dedicated indoor/outdoor training and practice riding facilities. The curriculum focus is on rider safety and skills training, vehicle maintenance, trail etiquette and ethics, and a variety of youth-oriented certification courses. Typically, DNR Enforcement Education & Training Section Staff assist in developing or reviewing the training curriculum for this facility, and in training volunteer instructors in the delivery of ATV and OHM safety training coursework. Volunteer participation is critical to the long-term success of the OHVRA. Authorizing legislation calls for the implementation of "adopt-a-recreation area" measures as set forth under MS 85.045. This program encourages individuals, business and civic groups to volunteer to improve and maintain state recreation facilities. Volunteers are an excellent source of labor for trail construction, maintenance, management and long-term monitoring efforts. Volunteer programs can lead to improved, mutually-supportive relationships between constituent groups and facility managers Examples of volunteer projects might include helping develop rest areas, interpretive projects, or cleaning-up litter and debris. Special project assignments, like developing non-motorized hiking trails, scenic overlooks, interpretive materials or facilities, or carrying out restoration or planting programs are also important. In so doing, OHV groups can also sponsor concurrent safety or equipment demonstrations, trail repair workshops, or skills training workshops for club members. Trail inventory, mapping or monitoring projects, are another area where volunteer labor can be especially helpful. VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page22 3. Special Events. The OHVRA is well-suited for hosting Special Events. Events generate revenue and bring in large numbers of visitors. However, from a management standpoint, events can be costly, labor intensive, time-consuming, and carry an element of risk. For that reason, it is important that events be well-planned and coordinated, and that event areas be properly designed, located and maintained. Various type of competitive or non-competitive outdoor events may be staged at the OHVRA, subject to environmental and noise considerations. Specific permit conditions will vary depending on the type of event and expected attendance. No vehicle races or other competitive events maybe held at the Gilbert location, due to its proximity tooccupieddwellings. These events may, however, be permitted at the Virginia Expansion site. Special events require prior approval by DNR Parks & Trails and issuance of a Special Event Permit. A fee may be charged to cover the DNR's costs associated with staff time, equipment or materials needed to conduct the event. A surety bond will also be held to ensure that sponsors restore the facility to its' preevent condition. Permit terms are negotiable and depend upon the required level of services, and who provides these services. The Facility Manager will notify the Local Area (Citizen’s) Advisory Committee annually of the proposed schedule of special events. He/she will also notify and consult with the Gilbert City Council regarding the annual calendar of planned special events at the OHVRA. Vehicle checks will be conducted at the main gate. All OHVs entering the facility, except for special competition vehicles, must display a current off-road sticker. Vehicles licensed in another state need not purchase a Minnesota off-road sticker. There is no fee for general admission or for parking, except during certain events. Registered competition vehicles, with engine or exhaust modifications, will be admitted to designated event areas only for practice and competition. All operators must wear helmets, unless their vehicle is equipped with an approved roll-cage and passenger harnesses. All event participants must wear helmets. IV. PROJECTEFFECTS A.ENVIRONMENTALEFFECTS. 1. Land-Use. This project complies with all provisions of both the Gilbert and Virginia City Zoning Ordinances. The Land-use districts in eastern Virginia include mostly ‘Mining and Open Space,’ but also a mixed classification for Section 21, which includes areas classified as ‘Public Property,’ ‘Industrial,’ or ‘Residential’ land-uses. Land-use classifications in those portions within the City of Gilbert include the ‘Public, Recreation and Forest Reserve District’ (Sections 11, 12, 14 and 23) and the ‘Mining and Industrial Activity District’ (Sec. 12, 13 and 24). Development of the OHVRA expansion is consistent with and conforms to current zoning ordinances. Public recreation is deemed a ‘permitted use’ in each of these municipal land-use districts. LandCover. Approximately 80% of disturbed acres are assumed to come from the Brush/Grassland cover type, with the remaining 20% coming from the Wooded/Forest type. No permanent or irreversible cover type conversions are associated with this project. Development activities will be limited primarily to improving existing road and trail corridors, establishing new trail networks, and stabilizing associated soils, slopes and cutbanks. The following table summarizes expected pre/post project cover type changes. VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page23 Table5.

They are not, however, true impervious surfaces. Truly impervious surfaces, like asphalt, concrete, or plastic materials, repel water and have zero infiltration rates. Compacted natural surfaces do retain infiltration capability, albeit much reduced from natural uncompacted conditions. 2. Surface Water Quality. This project involves trail crossings of both the Pike River and two unnamed tributaries, which are state public waters regulated by the MDNR. MDNR’s Division of Waters and Section of Fisheries have been consulted regarding impact avoidance and minimization measures. The Pike River crossing will extend approximately 1,100 feet across associated wetlands. This crossing will require the construction of a new bridge, and some fill will also be needed along the wetland segment. The crossing will be built to forest road standards to support construction and maintenance equipment. The road will be graveled and elevated by using fill material through the wetlands. Guidelines for the construction of road crossings are provided in the 2006 MDNR report, “Best practices for meeting MDNR General Public Waters Work Permit (GP 2004-001).” Once across the Pike River lowlands, the core trail will use segments of existing roads and trails, which may already have crossing structures in-place. These existing stream and wetland crossing structures will be used when feasible and repaired or upgraded when necessary. Little new or added construction is anticipated. The exact locations or numbers of any new or expanded water crossings has not yet been determined. All bridge and culvert placements will be appropriately sized, and installed when drainageways are dry. Both the upstream and downstream culvert ends will be protected with rock and rip-rap material. Trail crossings of smaller ephemeral drainageways will use a combination of culvert and rock rip-rap materials that will provide a hardened trail surface, while protecting the stream bed and banks from wheeled-traffic. Where crossings do prove necessary, bridges will be preferred to culverts. All such crossings will be developed according to Best Practices Guidelines and permit specifications. Since much of the riparian area of the Pike River is comprised of wetlands, the river substrate is composed of mostly soft, unconsolidated sediments. This contributes to a less diverse invertebrate community than that typically found in lake systems, and one that is relatively tolerant of increased nutrient or sediment loads. Fauna in this riverine system are fairly resilient to water quality changes. However, continued monitoring of the Pike River and its tributaries is suggested (by DNR VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page24 Fisheries) to identify any future impacts to water quality and/or the invertebrate population of these rivers. 3. Lakes, Streams &WetlandImpacts. The MDNR will design, construct, operate and maintain OHV trails with the goal of protecting and maintaining water quality and surface hydrology. Construction setbacks in riparian areas, along steep slopes or in unstable soils will help minimize erosion and stream sedimentation. Vegetated filter strips will also help preserve the integrity of shoreland zones. Project planning, design, and construction will be conducted in accordance with site-level water quality guidelines and best management practices. (Surface hydrology is shown in Fig. 6 -NWIMap). Riparian Area Protections. Practices that improve trail drainage and manage runoff will include a mix of design features such as rolling dips and grades and outsloped or crowned trail treads. Structural erosion controls include measures such as tread hardening, water bars, and sediment basins, which help minimize soil erosion and stream sedimentation. Trails will be designed, located, constructed and maintained in a manner which will not impede natural flow conditions. Trail construction will be setback a distance of 50 feet or more from the Ordinary High Water Level (OHWL) of all surface waters and tributaries, with the exception of unavoidable water crossings. Where no feasible placement alternative exists, trails will maintain as sizable a setback distance as is possible and feature an enhanced vegetative filter. Vegetated filter strips will be maintained around all riparian areas, especially adjacent to the Pike River and its unnamed tributaries. Runoff will be directed into these strips for on-site filtration. Public water access will be limited to footpaths which will be signed, fenced, gated and/or landscaped to prevent vehicular access. Wetlands. The NWI map shows that wetlands occupy 14% of the project area (or 385 ac.). According to the NRCS soils map, hydric soil delineations and hydric/non-hydric soil complexes cover about 640 acres or 24% of the site (Figure 5 – Soils Map). Hydric soils are characterized as poorly to very poorly drained. Lowland or wetland vegetative cover types are estimated to cover about 19% of the project area (Table 1). Sequencing steps (i.e., avoidance, minimization, delineation, permitting and mitigation) will be followed during all phases of project development. When unavoidable environmental effects are identified, impacts will be minimized and wetland loss mitigated according to the “no net-loss” requirements of the Wetlands Conservation Act.. Wetland mitigation will be in-place and in-kind, wherever and whenever possible. Restoration of previously degraded wetlands on site will also be given serious consideration by DNR’s Area Management Team Members. Wetland soils and vegetation, shoreland zones, stream crossings, and seepage areas will be avoided during initial trail placement. After flagging lowland routes, a wetland technical evaluation panel will evaluate actual site conditions. The team will be comprised of representatives from the MDNR, the Soil & Water Conservation District, and the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers. No construction will begin until wetlands and areas of hydric soils have been delineated, mitigations identified, and all necessary construction permits have been issued. 4. SoilErosionandStream Sedimentation. (Fig. 7-SoilsMap) The construction of an estimated 75 miles of roads and trails will disturb approximately 91.0 acres, calculated at 1.21 acres per mile of VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page25 10-foot wide trail (max.-width). Using an estimated one-foot deep soil disturbance zone, a maximum of about 150,000 cubic yards of soil will be moved or otherwise disturbed as a result of this expansion. This ‘worst-case’ estimate presumes that construction corridors are essentially ‘undisturbed’, which is often not the case. Much of this site has been previously disturbed as a result of road or trail building, mining or mineral exploration, or informal public use. Most of the site features gentle to moderate slopes and moderate soil erosion hazard ratings. Areas with severe erosion risks or other identified physical limitations will be avoided. Accelerated soil erosion can result from improper trail design, construction, grading, or failure to control storm water runoff. Uncontrolled soil erosion can, in turn, lead to the sedimentation of surface waters and wetlands, degradation of aquatic habitat, and disturbance to the natural (hydrologic) functioning of wetland areas. The MDNR’s Trail Planning, Design, and Development Guidelines (MDNR 2006) provides guidance for building sustainable trails across challenging slopes, soils, sub-soil conditions, and in areas with serious erosion hazards. All construction will comply with these guidelines and recommendations. Mitigation Measures. Although mechanical action will be required along both new and existing corridors, the areal extent and depth of excavation will be kept to a minimum. Treadway improvements may include elevating the treadway, surface grading or out-sloping, installing or modifying culverts, or in some cases, installing geotextile construction fabric or geocells (structural stabilizer blocks). Irregularities in the treadway will be rectified by filling rather than cutting in order to minimize disturbance. Areas deemed too wet, unstable or too highly erosive will be avoided. Off-site soil loss or movement, beyond naturally occurring levels, is not expected. Overland runoff during construction will be controlled using hay bales, check dams, and silt fences; vegetative cover through seeding and/or mulching; or by creating small sediment ponds or catchment basins. Runoff will also be re-directed into vegetated areas for on-site filtration. Cut banks will be revegetated with a native seed mix formulated to benefit wildlife. Hydrologic flow conditions will be maintained or improved in most work areas. A Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP), including best management practices for preventing erosion and sedimentation, will be developed and followed per MPCA Construction Stormwater General Permit requirements. 5. Fish, Wildlife & Ecologically Sensitive Species. Construction related activities will, to some extent, reduce the quality of affected wildlife habitats. Game and non-game species will also be subject to disturbance caused by the ongoing human activity and noise associated with OHV use. Upon completion, the 3,900 acre Iron Range OHVRA is expected to accommodate up to 100 riders per day, based upon a projected 50% increase in visitation over present levels. This equates to approximately 40 acres per rider. Wildlife should be minimally impacted by this intensity of use. Sizable inactive or unused areas: 1) On the southwestern end, 2) Within buffer areas and private in holdings, 3) Along a broad wetland zone of the Pike River, and 4) Outside of the project area, will give most species the opportunity to escape disturbances attributable to trail riders. Given the area’s long history of forestry, mining and landfill activity, most of the common species present in the project area are likely to be quite tolerant of disturbance. Species which are tolerant of, and in some cases thrive upon, disturbance and early successional vegetative stages (i.e., white-tailed deer, red fox, raccoon) are not likely to be seriously affected by a project of this size and character at either the site-level or population-level. While for other, less mobile species inhabiting the VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page26 project area, some displacement may occur, and limited mortality could be expected as a result of intra-species competition and loss of habitat. Priority conservation actions needed to protect and maintain key habitats and species are focused on 1) Upland deciduous mixed hardwood-pine forest, 2) Upland coniferous red-white pine forest, 3) Jack Pine woodlands, 4) Lowland coniferous forest;, and 5) Stream habitats. Less than 10% of the Virginia Expansion Site contains these habitats. Trail construction in or near these habitats will be minimized, or carefully designed to preserve and maintain habitat integrity. Area Management Team members will help guide trail development and will consult with facility managers on potential wildlife habitat management issues. Habitat Condition and Fragmentation. The ‘disturbed’ soils and vegetation of mined areas cover approximately 29% of the 2,704-acre site. Having a limited value for wildlife, the disturbed sites are well-suited for developing recreational trails. Proper avoidance and mitigation steps can further limit the wildlife habitat effects. Examples include avoiding wetlands and observing appropriate construction setbacks from surface waters, routing trails around (rather than through) contiguous habitat types, and limiting public access to nesting sites or critical habitat features. Habitat connectivity, biodiversity and forest fragmentation effects can also be minimized by keeping newly constructed trails narrow and soil/site disturbance to a minimum. Habitat fragmentation will be minimized by 1) Using primarily existing corridors, 2) Keeping corridors as narrow as possible, and 3) Minimizing disturbance associated with new trail construction. Although trail bed grading and shaping will be required along portions of some existing corridors, forest canopy alteration will only occur along new trail segments where vegetation will be cleared to a height of about 10-feet for rider safety. Overhead forest canopy will be retained whenever possible, and trail alignments will generally avoid large trees or dense, unbroken vegetation. Invasive Terrestrial Species. All new trails will be closely monitored for invasive species during the first year after construction and periodically thereafter, according to established standards and protocols (DNR Op Order 113). These site-level guidelines contain procedures specific to trails and trail use intended to “prevent or limit the introduction, establishment and spread of invasive species”. Where infestations are identified, control methods will be applied to limit their spread to uninfested areas. Keeping riders on designated trails will limit the potential transport of invasives to uninfested woodlands. A vehicle wash facility already exists near the Gilbert Contact Station so that seeds, soil, and vegetative material can be removed from vehicles. Information on identifying and preventing the spread of invasive species will be provided to OHVRA visitors. Rare or Sensitive Species Protections. MDNR Natural Heritage and Nongame Research Program database (NHIS) reviews of this site were conducted in October 1999, then again in February and November of 2009 to identify significant natural features known to occur within or proximate to the project area. These reviews noted the presence of Peregrine Falcon (Falco perigrinus), Red-Shouldered Hawk (Buteo lineatus), Grape-ferns (Botrychium sp.) and Canada Lynx (Lynx Canadensis). Suggested measures for avoiding or minimizing impacts to these species were provided by NHIS Staff and have been incorporated into the project design and construction plan. VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page27 Adaptive Management. Should evidence of any of these species be identified during project planning, design or construction, appropriate steps will be taken to reduce the potential for population or habitat effects. Among the approaches most commonly taken are the following: • Spatially separate humans and wildlife in sensitive or unique habitats. Separate humans and wildlife during critical periods (e.g., breeding or nesting); • Strictly control human use of access and development corridors. Restrict off-road and off-trail vehicle use, especially in sensitive areas (e.g., riparian areas); • Whenever possible, avoid trail development in unroaded areas, minimize corridor width, increase curvilinearity, maintain forest canopy cover, and develop and maintain corridors at the minimum standard necessary for intended use(s), and • Actively work to prevent the introduction of exotic plant species. These species greatly diminish the quality and utility of native habitat. With these precautions, and with continuous site monitoring, no significant, lasting or irreversible impacts to sensitive species or their habitats are anticipated to result from implementation of this project as described. 6. Construction Effects (Temporary). Seventy five miles of new and existing trail is proposed over the life of the project. Little or no mechanical action is proposed for most existing upland corridors, with activity limited to remedial measures, (i.e., filling ruts and holes; soil stabilization, out slope maintenance, etc.) Some limited construction will be necessary to improve cut and fill slopes, treadway conditions in wet areas, and any unstable or erosive segments. Ground fabrics and fill material, such as gravel or other aggregate materials, will be applied to rutted areas to stabilize and elevate the trail treadway. Excavation will be kept to a minimum to reduce soil erosion and potential future drainage problems. In areas of highly compactable soils, dry granular soil or gravel fill will be added to stabilize trail surfaces and fill low spots (rather than by cutting with heavy equipment). Treadway crowning, hardening, outsloping and other suitable grade modifications will also be employed to manage runoff and erosion. Runoff will be directed into vegetated areas by ditching, and secondary measures may be applied if vegetated buffers lack the capacity to absorb the flow. Cut and fill slopes will be maintained to ensure treadway stability. Periodic grading and filling will also help shape the trail treadway to shed water and stabilize the treadway surface. New trail corridors will typically be sinewy and limited to required vehicle widths, from two to six feet wide, in order to improve rider interest, enjoyment, and challenge. These new corridors will be configured to control erosion in hilly areas by incorporating grade dips, grade reversals, rolling dips, and switchbacks into the alignment. Clearing new corridors will entail flagging suitable pathways for the trail system and removing brush and small trees to ground level and delimbing larger trees to a height of 10-feet. Chainsaws, brush saws, overhead limb saws, and possibly a brush mower, will be used for brushing trails. The treadway will be further prepared by grubbing the surface to remove roots, stumps and large rocks. Debris will be pushed away from the trail so as not to create a safety hazard. Materials disturbed during construction will be reused when possible, or deposited at borrow sites and revegetated. New trail corridor construction may require treadway elevation, out-sloping, bench cuts, culvert VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page28 installation, and/or heavy surface blading. Equipment necessary to accomplish this may include an AT300; Sweco dozer or crawler; backhoe; or ASV Posi-Track loader. Sign installation will require the use of post-hole diggers or pounders. The locations of borrow pits are not known at this time. Wet areas, riparian areas, and steep, unstable or erosive sites will be avoided. Invasive Terrestrial Species. Existing infestations will be identified within specific construction areas. Construction work will begin in non-infested areas before moving to infested areas, and equipment will be thoroughly cleaned after all work in infested areas. Disturbed areas will be immediately re-vegetated per departmental policies and guidelines. The introduction of exotic or invasive weeds from construction activities will be minimized by removing the top organic layers prior to excavating fill materials so that only mineral soils are removed. Borrow pits will also be situated as close to the work site as possible, and will not be located near natural areas. Any material (top soil, gravel, seed mix) brought to the site from an outside source will be certified weed free. 7. Noise, Dust, Traffic & Odors. Noise will be generated both during trail construction and facility operations. Construction-related noise will be temporary and occur only during daylight hours. OHV generated noise depends upon the number and types of machines operating in a particular area, on the type of engines (i.e., 2-cycle vs. 4-stroke), engine displacement, RPM levels at which machines are operating, and the effectiveness of vehicle noise emission controls (i.e., mufflers and exhaust baffles.) As visitation increases, an increase in noise over current conditions can be expected. However, the Virginia expansion area is substantially more remote and has fewer close neighbors than does the Gilbert Site. No occupied dwellings are located within 2,500 feet of planned vehicle operations in the expansion area. Moreover, the area is predominantly located within the ‘industrial’ land-use classification, which permits higher ambient noise levels under state law. Under normal operating conditions, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency’s Daytime Ambient Noise Standards for L50 = 60 dB(A) (that level exceeded 50% of the time), or the L10 = 65 dB(A) standard (that level exceeded 10% of the time), will not be exceeded by park visitors. Vehicles entering the facility are routinely checked for required noise suppression equipment, then tested and certified if they meet state vehicle noise emission standards. Machines that fail to meet standards cannot be used at the facility. Repeated ambient testing conducted by MDNR staff, with the assistance of MPCA staff, at sensitive noise receptors located adjacent to the Gilbert facility, has shown that State Noise Standards can be met regardless of seasonality (leaf-on or leaf-off), prevailing wind conditions, or the numbers or types of vehicles in operation during the testing cycles. Despite the remoteness of the Virginia expansion area, some may still characterize the ATV/OHM engine sound as “annoying,” especially considering the low ambient noise levels typical for rural areas. While acknowledging the potential for annoyance, the MDNR does not believe that anticipated noise levels will, under any circumstance, constitute a ‘nuisance’ under state law [See Minn. Rules, Chap. 7030]. MPCA, acting in concert with MDNR and local governmental units, is charged with enforcing Minnesota’s State Noise Standards. VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page29 Although the additional OHV traffic will produce increased noise levels over current conditions, over the longer term, OHV noise, in the aggregate, is expected to decline with the advent of newer, quieter machines. Noise propagation is also mitigated by foliage and dense understory vegetation during the summer months and by snow during late fall and winter. The hilly landscape, and wind patterns will also help to attenuate or ‘muffle’ vehicle generated noise. Since operations of the active Iron Range OHVRA-Gilbert site began in 2002, no noise issues or complaints have surfaced, despite the close proximity of several homes and businesses. The Gilbert facility has achieved a voluntary 10-15 dB(A) reduction from noise levels allowed under state law. This has been achieved through the use of setbacks, berms and buffers, and by implementing trail design techniques and traffic flow restrictions that act to limit noise. This reduced noise standard will not be necessary in the Virginia Expansion site given its remote location, its industrial landuseclassification,anditslackofanynearby sensitivenoisereceptors(e.g.,occupieddwellings). Odors. Ambient odors generated from nearby stationary sources, (i.e., asphalt processing plant, open pit mining operations, landfill operations, DM&IR Railway, etc.) are likely of greater magnitude than vehicle emissions generated on the Virginia Expansion site. Construction and maintenance-related odors and emissions will be of a minor and temporary nature, while operational emissions will vary in intensity as a function of the amount of OHV traffic generated along established trails. The odors are anticipated to dissipate quickly under typical climate and wind conditions. Dust. Operation of OHV’s during dry conditions on graveled or natural surface trails will result in the generation of airborne dust. Dust generated during dry, windy conditions can be troublesome, both for neighbors and for recreation area visitors. However, dusty conditions are expected to be localized, and limited to a narrow zone along heavily used roads and trails. Little or no off-site transport of fugitive dust is anticipated. Problem segments will be stabilized with additional gravel, or temporarily closed until conditions improve. 8. Vehicle Emissions & Air Quality. Vehicle exhaust emissions will increase during both construction and facility operations. Construction-related emissions will be minor and temporary in nature, arising from the use of heavy equipment to create or improve roads and trails. Longer-term operational emissions will result from the operation of highway-licensed vehicles (needed to access and manage the site) and off-highway vehicles operated on-site. Emissions from these sources are currently at low ambient levels in the project area. With the proposed expansion, emissions will increase proportionate to the number of new riders that visit and use the park. Visitation is expected to increase by about 50% over current levels, or to about 15,000 riders/yr. Off-highway Vehicles (OHVs) emit pollutants that can linger, especially at intersections or where vehicles congregate. Local climatic conditions will, however, act to dissipate, dilute, and control concentrations of noxious vehicle emissions. Winds are more pronounced in open areas, atop mine dumps, and in other upland areas where most road/trails will be located. Although OHV tailpipe emissions may be objectionable to some, they are unlikely to exceed state or federal air quality standards. B.SOCIAL,ECONOMIC&COMMUNITYEFFECTS. VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page30 1. Character of the Project Area. Any potential large-scale community effects related to this project (positive or negative) would be similar in scope and scale to those resulting from nearby recreational trail developments (Figure 8). That is, socio-economic or environmental effects stemming from the Virginia Expansion will likely be comparable to those of other area recreation projects. More importantly, project (negative) impacts will pale in comparison to the effects of nearby commercial and industrial operations. This expansion project is expected to contribute positively to the social and economic well-being of the greater Quad Cities Area. 2. Scenic, Visual or Aesthetic Effects. Overlook areas will be developed to complement the core trail system and vehicle specified trail networks. The overlook areas will take advantage of the impressive views from the top of 125’+ tall mine dumps. Vehicle restraints and pedestrian setbacks from scenic vistas and overlooks will be installed to ensure that overlooks are safe for visitors, and that they do not impair natural, scenic or aesthetic values. 3. Recreational Opportunity. Several complementary recreational trail developments are currently underway in the vicinity of the Iron Range OHVRA. Some trail connections (to the OHVRA) already exist and more are planned. Among the projects currently underway are the Moose ATV/OHM Trail, the Mesabi Mountain ORV Trail, the Genoa ATV/OHM Trail, and the Mesabi Hiking/Biking Trail. Each is discussed briefly below. Allareshownin Figure8inAppendixD. The Moose Trail is a planned seven-mile ATV/Off-Highway Motorcycle (OHM) Trail that will connect the City of Biwabik to the Iron Range OHVRA at Gilbert. The trail, currently under construction, is being developed largely along an existing snowmobile trail corridor. The East Range ATV/Snowmobile Club hopes to accommodate ATV use of the corridor during the snow-free season. The trail’s proximity to the OHVRA will enable MDNR Staff to monitor trail use and trail conditions, and will eventually connect to the OHVRA, as well as lodging, camping and support services located nearby. This new trail access should help alleviate (mostly unintentional) private property trespass and reduce ditch riding in the vicinity of the OHVRA. The Mesabi Mountain GIA Trail is a 4.1-mile trail, currently being developed for use by registered Off-Road Vehicles (ORVs). The trail will begin just east of the Mesabi Range Community and Technical College in Eveleth, then wind northeastward through heavily forested public and private lands. The difficult terrain and ledge-rock will create a challenging jeep trail rated “most-difficult” for experienced drivers. Its proximity to the Iron Range OHVRA will provide park visitors with an additional nearby riding opportunity. The Genoa ATV/OHM Trail provides a direct connection from the City of Eveleth to the City of Gilbert, beginning at the intersection of Highways 53 and 37 in Eveleth, and traveling 3.5 miles east to the Sherwood Forest Campground in Gilbert. It is a gravel-surfaced trail open only to ATVs and OHMs. This trail serves as an important connection between the Iron Range OHVRA and hotels and restaurants in the City of Eveleth. The Mesabi Trail is a paved non-motorized hike/bike trail that connects the communities of Grand Rapids, Coleraine, Bovey, Taconite, Marble through Calumet and Pengilly, Nashwauk, Keewatin, Hibbing, Chisholm, Buhl, Kinney, Mountain Iron, Virginia, Gilbert, Sparta, Fayal, Eveleth and McKinley. Most recently, a 3.5 mile link between McKinley and Biwabik was paved during Summer VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page31 2009. The Mesabi Trail, winds through both the Gilbert and Virginia portions of the Iron Range OHV Recreation Area. 4. Transportation & Vehicle Traffic. Visitor and recreational vehicle traffic in and around the Quad Cities Area of St. Louis County (i.e., Virginia, Eveleth, Gilbert and Mountain Iron) will increase marginally with the expansion of the Iron Range OHVRA at Virginia. Noise, traffic, and vehicle exhaust emissions will also increase accordingly. This additional increment of disturbance associated with park expansion is, however, not anticipated to be problematic or deleterious, especially when considered on a regional scale. 5. Public Safety & Enforcement. During its first seven years of operation, there have been few problems with illegal activity in or around the Gilbert OHVRA. There have been no breaches of the perimeter fence, and no complaints from adjacent landowners or homeowners. Rider compliance with posted rules and regulations has been excellent. Site Managers expect this same level of visitor cooperation and compliance when the Virginia Expansion is added sometime in 2010. Local law enforcement, first-responders, and emergency medical services personnel have helped to ensure public safety at the Iron Range OHVRA. Since operations began at the Gilbert site in 2002, local officials have not deemed this added workload to be problematic or deleterious to their operations. Special legislative appropriations have also been made available to local enforcement authorities to step-up OHV enforcement patrols. 6. Land-Use Compatibility. A large taconite mining operation is located just east of the Virginia Expansion site; a gravel mining operation is located on the northwest; and an active solid waste facility and haul road border the southwest portion of the project area. In addition, a former (now closed) solid waste facility is located in Section 10, just outside of the southern project boundary. Noise, dust and vegetative cover type changes resulting from this project will pale in comparison to impacts associated with these and other nearby commercial and industrial operations. Pending Developments. Gravel mining operations have recently been approved for an area just south of the project boundary in Section 22. A retail development along Highway 135, also in Section 22, is contemplated, but construction permits have not yet been issued. United Taconite plans on moving its mining activities into Section 16, which is within the southwestern quadrant of the project area. This development would restrict OHV activities within the active mine area for an extended period. However, The timeframe for United Taconite’s planned expansion has not been finalized. Until a final resolution is provided, development of the Virginia site will proceed as outlined in this Master Plan Amendment. 7. LocalEconomicEffects. Research sponsored by DNR and conducted in 1997, prior to opening the Gilbert Site, estimated visitation at between 10,000 and 20,000 user-days per year. The associated economic impact was estimated at between $200,000 and $400,000 annually to the local economy. This was based upon a number of factors, including location and travel distances, vehicle registrations, and per capita visitor spending of $20 per day. This impact was expected to occur gradually, as the facility was developed, and it did anticipate a connected site nearby. VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page32 Visitor estimates have proven remarkably accurate, despite the lengthy delay in securing the Virginia Expansion, which was authorized in 1999. The typical number of riders that use the existing Iron Range OHVRA facility (at Gilbert) during the peak summer use period ranges from 25-45 visitors per day, with peak visitation ranging up to as many as 100 visitors per day on weekends and holidays. Contact Station records indicate that the park currently receives about 10,000 visitors annually. With the expansion, visitation is expected to jump by 50% to about 15,000 riders/yr. Although economic effects are more subtle and difficult to quantify, there has been a noticeable increase in economic activity that followed the opening of the OHVRA in Gilbert (in 2002). Many formerly vacant storefronts are no longer, and several new businesses have opened – some catering to OHVRA visitors. Occupancy at the City’s Sherwood Forest Campground has also increased dramatically, leading to plans to substantially expand this facility. Special events held at the OHVRA have boosted general economic activity in Gilbert, and lodging at Eveleth hotels and motels is at or near capacity during larger events. Tentative plans call for future construction of a hotel or motel in the City of Gilbert. Such plans may well hinge on this planned expansion, and on the many visitors – new and old that this expanded off-road riding opportunity is likely to attract. 8. Infrastructure & Public Services. This project will have no discernable impact on local roads, public utilities or services, aside from the nominal increase in tourism and traffic (discussed above). This added visitor traffic is not expected to tax existing roads, utilities or public services. 9. Historic & Cultural Resources. No historical, cultural or architectural features were identified within or immediately adjacent to the Virginia Expansion site during the database search conducted by the Minnesota State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) in 2009. Historical properties located within one-mile of the project area include: Gilbert High School, Gilbert City Hall, First National Bank, Hopkins Park and the Glen Avon Presbyterian Church. Several historical houses and commercial buildings are also located in the nearby City of Virginia, Minnesota. Should any unknown archeological resources be identified during site development, MDNR will consult with the SHPO and the State Archeologist to determine the nature of the discovery and likely development effects, as well as the possible need for mitigation. 10. Unique Local/Regional Resources. The Iron Range OHVRA is Minnesota’s only state-run off-highway vehicle recreation area. As such, it represents a new and innovative approach to mine land reclamation. It adds a new dimension to traditional outdoor recreation in Northeastern Minnesota. It is also the state’s only user-funded State Recreation Area, supported solely by appropriations from dedicated funding accounts. Account revenues generated through vehicle registrations and unrefunded fuel taxes have financed the planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of this facility since it was first authorized in 1996. V. PLANIMPLEMENTATION A. ENGINEERING DESIGN & CONSTRUCTION. Road and trail construction will total about 75 miles when this facility is completed. The disturbance zone is estimated to be 91.0 acres in size (1.21 acres per mile of trail for ten-foot wide corridors). Although most trail construction will not exceed a width of 108 inches (nine feet), a ten-foot width was selected as a representative corridor width to ensure that total disturbance was not underestimated. This calculation also presumes that construction corridors are essentially ‘undisturbed’, which is often not the case. Much of this site has been previously disturbed as a result of road or trail building, informal public use, or through mining or VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page33 mineral exploration. Overlooks, scenic vistas, pull-offs, rest areas, and day-use sites will also eventually be developed at the Virginia site. Maintenance and operation of the expansion area will be integrated with operations at the Gilbert Site. B. INITIAL OPERATIONS, YEARS 1-2. Initially, during the first season of operation, only major Core Trails and Connector Trails will be open to public use. The development of secondary or ‘feeder’ trails and support facilities will proceed gradually throughout the first 2-3 years of operation, and perhaps beyond. Completion of all planned 75-miles of roads and trails, and planned support facilities is not expected prior to the fifth season of operation. The final location of roads and trails will be determined using trail siting criteria that: 1) Make maximum use of existing disturbed corridors, 2) Select new corridors that are judged to be sustainable and suitable for their intended purpose, and 3) Minimize negative effects on the site’s natural resources. Wetlands, riparian areas, and shoreland zones will be steadfastly avoided. Steep hills, rocky cliffs (except for access to overlooks) and dense vegetation or areas with large trees will also be avoided whenever and wherever possible. C. FUTURE EXPANSION PLANS & OHV TRAVEL LINKS. While future expansion or boundary modifications remain a possibility, no plans exist at this time to seek legislative authorization or funding for any future additions to the park. There are no plans to develop additional infrastructure or expanded parking facilities at either Gilbert or Virginia. Mining can and will continue to occur in conjunction with recreational activity as stipulated in authorizing legislation. Some relocation of OHV trails may prove necessary in the future should existing mine leases be activated or expanded. D. LONG-TERMOPERATIONS,MAINTENANCE&MONITORING. Facility Operations. The Iron Range OHVRA, which opened in 2002, is operated year-round during daylight hours, with reduced scheduling during winter months. It is closed during the annual firearms deer season. There is no fee for admission, except for attendance at some special events. There is only one public entrance to the OHVRA via State Highway 135 off Enterprise Trail to Pettit Road (in the City of Gilbert). Registered vehicles that possess the required safety equipment, mufflers and spark arrestors are admitted if they comply with applicable sound regulations (ATVs = 99dB(A) and OHMs = 96 or 99 dB(A), depending upon the year manufactured, using the Standard SAE 1287 sound test). All vehicles must be equipped with manufacturer-supplied noise suppression devices. Vehicle checks will be conducted at the main gate. Spot checks will also be conducted periodically, in and around the park, to ensure compliance with state noise regulations. Seasonal or temporary road and trail closures may be imposed at any time due to wet soil conditions, active logging or mining operations, wildfire danger, or for trail maintenance and repair. Temporary trail closures are most likely to occur during spring thaw or following heavy summer rainfall events. All active use areas are fenced and barriers have been erected to prevent unlawful entry or trespass. Trail Monitoring & Maintenance. Trail monitoring and trail maintenance will be done by DNR Area Staff using state equipment per standard agency operating policies and procedures. Methods, materials and technical specifications will be consistent with accepted Best Management Practices as described in DNR’s ‘Trail Planning, Design & Development Guidelines’ (MN DNR, 2006). Monitoring VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page34 and maintenance protocols are also discussed in this publication and in various supplemental guidance documents such as the DNR Parks & Trails, Trails & Waterways Section, Discipline Guidelines for Invasive Species Management per Operational Order #113 (Eff. Date 02/10/09). Trail Ambassadors may assist land managers in monitoring trail use. The DNR Division of Enforcement administers the ‘Minnesota Off-highway Vehicle Safety & Conservation (or Trail Ambassador) Program’ (MS Ch. 84.9011) which promotes safe, environmentally responsible operation of OHVs through informational and educational contacts, and through volunteer monitoring efforts. Trail Ambassadors provide a positive role model for peers, and can provide welcome support for park visitors. Trail Ambassadors are also trained and certified in trail monitoring, invasive species identification, first aid, OHV rules and regulations, and trail use policies and guidelines. Enforcement. Local law enforcement, first-responders, and/or emergency medical services personnel will assist DNR Conservation Officers in ensuring public safety during the operation of the newly expanded Iron Range OHVRA. Since operations began in 2002, local officials have not considered this added workload to be problematic or deleterious to their local operations. Although Trail Ambassadors may also assist, on a volunteer basis, they are not licensed peace officers and they cannot arrest or detain violators. VA Amend.doc REV. 01/29/10 VirginiaOHVRA–MasterPlanAmendment Page35 APPENDIXA IRON RANGE OFF-HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION AREA CITIZEN’S ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEMBER LIST 2009 Mr. Bill Aho  Mr. Charlie Baribeau  Iron Trail Conv. & Visitor’s Bureau  Virginia City Councilor  c/o Super 8 Motel, Hwy 53, Box 555  327 First Street South  Eveleth, Minnesota 55734  Virginia, MN 55792-2623  Bob Chance, OHVRA Manager Mr. David Westerberg MN DNR, Trails & Waterways MN 4WD Association 7196 Pettit Road, P.O.

INTRODUCTION The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) is evaluating several alternatives and construction options as part of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the realignment of Trunk Highway 53 (TH53) in Virginia, Minnesota. One of these options, designated as Alternative E1A reinforced soil slope (RSS) causeway/fill section (Alternative E-1A – RSS Option), extends across the inundated Rouchleau Mine Pit which is now a part of the Missabe Mountain Pit Lake1 . The project area is shown on Figure 1. MnDOT contracted with HDR Engineering, Inc. (HDR) and Gale-Tec Engineering, Inc. (GTE) to provide professional services to evaluate the feasibility of, probable costs for, and issues associated with partial dewatering of the pit for construction of the Alternative E-1A – RSS Option. The effects of temporarily lowering the water level in the pit on existing water supply systems with intakes in the Rouchleau Pit were also investigated. The Rouchleau Mine was formerly mined for iron-bearing ore. The pit was dewatered during mining operations and filled with groundwater after mining ceased in the early 1980s. The City of Virginia (Virginia Department of Public Utilities) currently obtains water from the abandoned pit for its municipal water supply through a 200 foot deep intake. The ArcelorMittal mine also pumps water from the pit to supplement the water in the Enterprise Pit, which it uses for its Minorca taconite plant operations. Water is also occasionally diverted from the pit to the Sauntry Creek system via the ArcelorMittal pumping facilities to augment Silver and Bailey Lakes in the City of Virginia. The Alternative E-1A – RSS Option involves construction of a roadway embankment on a section of a ledge that served as a mine haul road during active mining. The surface of the ledge is submerged approximately 30 feet below the current (2013) water surface. In order for the construction of the new embankment to occur in dry conditions, the pit would need to be partially dewatered for a period of approximately 12 months (3 months initial drawdown and 9 months of maintenance dewatering). This would involve obtaining permits and constructing pumping and conveyance infrastructure to transfer the water from the pit to an appropriate receiving water body. This report summarizes considerations that determine the feasibility of a range of ‘receiving water’ options for dewatering the pit, investigates the potential effects of dewatering on local water supply/groundwater systems, and provides concept-level design and cost information for two temporary dewatering system alternatives. Assessment of the environmental impacts of the options determined to be feasible by this study will be included in the Environmental Impact Statement documentation for the project. 2.

The scope also included two stakeholder meetings in Virginia. For the study, HDR relied on existing data from various sources. MnDOT and GTE provided information on the proposed alignment, construction dewatering requirements, proposed project schedule for the Alternative E-1A – RSS Option construction, and bathymetric data for the Rouchleau Pit. Existing information on historic pit water levels and water quality data were obtained from the City of Virginia. Well logs from water supply and monitoring wells were obtained from the County Well Index, the Cities of Virginia and Mountain Iron, and private well owners. ArcelorMittal and the City of Virginia provided dewatering and pumping operations data. 3. STUDYAREADESCRIPTION The Rouchleau Pit is located east of the City of Virginia, Minnesota on the Mesabi Iron Range (Figure 2). The region is characterized by iron ore mining activity with several active and inactive mines dominating the landscape around the City. The current Rouchleau Pit was formerly several separate mining pits that have since filled with water and become one water body at the current water level. From north to south, these former pits consisted of: the Columbia Pit, the Commodore Pit, the Missabe Mountain Pit, the Shaw-Moose Pit, the Rouchleau Pit, and the southern Rouchleau Extension, all of which were mined for iron ore from the late 1800s into the 1980s. The Rouchleau Pit and Rouchleau Extension were divided by a bedrock ledge which was used as a haul road during active mining. The bedrock ledge is currently covered with approximately 50 feet of mine dump material. When mining activity and dewatering ceased in the 1980s the water level in the pits rose, eventually submerging the ledge and mine fill. During September 2013, the water elevation in the pit was 1,305 feet above mean sea level (AMSL)2,3 . Measurements taken in August 2013 indicate that the top surface of the mine fill was approximately 30 feet below the surface water elevation, or at 1,275 feet. The pit water level is affected by pumping by the City of Virginia for municipal water supply and by pumping by ArcelorMittal to maintain the water level in the nearby Enterprise Pit. Intake and pumping facilities are shown on Figure 2. Water level records from 1983 to 2012 show that the water surface elevation in the pit reached a maximum of 1,310.65 feet in May 2009 (NTS, 2013). In 2011 the City of Virginia pumped an average of 1,794 gallons per minute (gpm) from the Rouchleau Pit. ArcelorMittal pumped an average of1,215 gpm from the Rouchleau Pit in 2012. 2 All elevations in this report are referenced to mean sea level. 3 Water levels in the pit have been shown to fluctuate. Measurements taken in September 2013 indicate a water surface elevation of 1,305 ft. Measurements in May 2014 indicate a water surface elevation of 1,310 ft. TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  p. 2  The Enterprise Pit is approximately 1,000 feet to the north of the Rouchleau Pit and is pumped by ArcelorMittal for potable and processing use at the Minorca taconite plant. On September 30, 2013, the water elevation in the Enterprise Pit was 1,312feet. Other mine pits exist around the Rouchleau Pit that are or have been dewateredbypumping. Active mine pits include the Cliffs Natural Resources-UTAC Pit approximately one mile to the southwest, which is dewatered at 2,000-2,700 gpm. U.S. Steel-Minntac currently dewaters at mine pits approximately two miles to the northwest. Mining operations at the Minorca Pit, approximately 0.5-mile to the northeast, ceased in 1993. The water elevation in the Minorca Pit in October 2012 was 1,468feet, upfrom 1,401feet in November 1998 (NTS, 2013). The water level in the Rouchleau Pit has historically been influenced by pumping, either as part of mining operations or by the City of Virginia. As a result, there is limited information on the static water level of the aquifer in the vicinity of the Rouchleau Pit. Estimates between 1,340 feet (MnDOT, 2014) and 1,428 feet (HDR, 1997) have been cited. It is conceivable that if all pumping from the pit were to cease in the future the water level could rise to an elevation similar to that in the City of Virginia well, which was 1,396 feet in November 1996 and 1,428 feet in June 1982 (HDR, 1997). However, the ultimate water level in the pit will depend on dewatering activities in the Biwabik Formation by other mines in the area. 4. HYDROLOGYANDHYDROGEOLOGYOFTHESTUDYAREA 4.1. GEOLOGYANDHYDROGEOLOGY The Rouchleau Pit is located in the Mesabi Iron Range, an iron-rich area in northeastern Minnesota. To the north of the pit, the Giants Range Granite Formation rises to form a topographic high that creates the Laurentian Divide. South of the Giants Range, under a mantle of glacial drift is a sequence of bedrock units including the Virginia Argillite, the Biwabik Formation, the Pokegama Quartzite, and Archean-aged basement rocks including the Ely Greenstone. These units have been warped into a Z-shaped geologic feature known as the “Virginia horn” in the vicinity of the Rouchleau Pit, causing the contacts of the Biwabik Formation with the Pokegama Quartzite and Virginia Argillite to assume the same shape. At Virginia, these formations have been folded, trending north to south, rather than following the normal east-west trend of the Mesabi Range. The Biwabik Formation is the primary aquifer contributing groundwater flow into the Rouchleau Pit. A detailed description and map of the regional geology is included in the Hydrogeology Section of the Appendix. The Biwabik formation is unconfined at the mine pits and groundwater levels in the aquifer are higher than the groundwater levels in the pits. Pits that are actively mined are pumped (dewatered) to control groundwater inflow. Well logs indicate the Biwabik Formation is 435 to 600 feet thick near the Rouchleau Pit and thickens to the southwest where it is 740 feet thick. The hydraulic conductivity of the Biwabik Formation is generally low and has reported to range from 0.0046 to 5 feet/day4 and from 0.33 to 6.6 feet/day5. Kanivetsky and Walton also give an -5 -3 aquifer storativity of about 10 to 10 for the Biwabik Formation. Well yields are typically low 4 HDR, 1997 5 Kanivetsky and Walton, 1979 TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  p. 3  except in places where the formation is locally fractured; in those locations it can yield up to 1,000 gallons per minute (gpm) to wells. The effects of mine dewatering on groundwater levels appear to be localized to areas near the pits and appear not to have caused a wide-spread drawdown of groundwater levels in the formation. For example, a map in a previous study6 showing November 20, 1996 water levels indicates the water level in the Rouchleau Pit (1,216 feet) was 180 feet lower than the water level in the City of Virginia well (1,396 feet) installed only 3,000feet from the pit. 4.2. WATERBALANCE Groundwater inflow into the Rouchleau Pit was calculated previously in water balance studies by others. HDR reviewed the hydrologic model presented in the report “Source Water Protection: Virginia Public Water Supply System, Alternative Sources and Selection Criteria”7. That report documented an average groundwater inflow rate of 2,306 gpm into the Rouchleau Pit during the 2004-2012 timeframe; this includes pumping by the City of Virginia over the entire timeframe and ArcelorMittal pumping that started in 2008. The HDR study8 indicated a groundwater inflow rate of 2,135 gpm into the pit during the 1991-1995 timeframe, which included pumping by the City of Virginia into the water balance. As part of the review, data in Appendix B from the NTS report 9 was entered into a spreadsheet and the calculations were checked. Calculations performed for this study matched the results for groundwater volumes and rates based on the data given in the NTS study (average groundwater inflow rate of 2,306 gpm). The hydrologic model assumptions presented were considered reasonable given the information available. As a supplemental check on the water balance completed for the City of Virginia, HDR used recent bathymetric data from the Rouchleau Pit to recalculate water volumes in the pit for specific water surface elevations. This information was used to compare how the groundwater volumes and rates would change compared to the original NTS hydrologic model. The result was an average groundwater rate of2,416 gpm, whichis comparable to the NTS model. Based on the water balance review the NTS hydrologic model can be considered an adequate assessment of water balance for the Rouchleau Pit. The inflow rate of 2,416 gpm calculated using the bathymetric data for the pit is a refinement to the NTS assessment. Because there is no information available that indicates future changes in outflow rates or pumping conditions, a groundwater inflow rate of 2,416 gpm will be used as a basis for developing dewatering rates for the study. 4.3. GROUNDWATERMODEL HDR developed a groundwater flow model to analyze the rate of groundwater inflow to the Rouchleau Pit and to estimate the decrease in localized groundwater levels outside of the pit that could result from the partial dewatering of the pit water level from 1,305to 1,275 feet. The 6 HDR, 1997 7 NTS, 2013 8 HDR, 1997 9 NTS, 2013 TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  p. 4  model was developed using MODFLOW 200010 , a finite-difference groundwater flow model developed by the UnitedStates GeologicalSurvey (USGS). The model consists of an approximately 43 square mile rectangular grid. It includes the Rouchleau Pit in its northeast corner, and extends from the pit to the southwest in the general direction dip of the Biwabik Formation. Lowering the pit level from 1,305 feet to 1,275 feet and maintaining it at the lower elevation for a period of several months will cause an increase in groundwater inflow to the pit and a depression of local groundwater levels, due to water flowing towards the pit during dewatering. The analysis shows that up to 3,400 gpm of additional groundwater inflow can be anticipated in the initial period followingdrawdown, reducingto an additional 2,100 gpm six to twelve months after drawdown, and then stabilizing at an additional 2,060 gpm if dewatering were to continue into the future, as shown in Table 4.1. A detailed description of the hydrogeology and groundwater modeling is included in the Appendix. Section 7.0 below describes the results of the assessment of dewatering impacts on localgroundwater wells. Table4.1 Groundwater InflowRates DuringDewatering Time Since Start Of Dewatering  AdditionalGroundwater Inflow From Lowering Pit Water Level From Elevation 1,305 Feet to 1,275 Feet (gpm)  1 month  3,407  2 months  2,623  6 months  2,117  12 months  2,062  5. DEWATERINGTRANSFER 5.1. WATERTRANSFERQUANTITYANDRATE HDR obtained bathymetric survey data collected by MnDOT in the fall of 2013 to determine an approximate volume of water associated with a drop in water surface elevation from 1,305 feet to 1,275 feet. The data indicates that a drop of 30 feet in the Rouchleau Pit water level represents a total volume of approximately 2.65 billion gallons. The bathymetric data also shows that the natural separation of the majority of the former mine pit complex (the Columbia Pit, the Commodore Pit, the Missabe Mountain Pit, the Shaw-Moose Pit, the Rouchleau Pit, and the southern Rouchleau Extension) would not be revealed at the proposed elevation of 1,275 with the exception of the separation of the Rouchleau Pit and southern Rouchleau Pit Extension (See Figure 8). The total volume of 2.65 billion gallons would need to be pumped from the pit to reveal the proposed roadway base and allow construction under dry conditions. Maintenance 10 Harbaugh et al., 2000 TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  p. 5  pumping would be required to maintain the water surface elevation at 1,275 feet during a portion of the construction period. Calculation of the initial drawdown rate and maintenance dewatering rate is described below. HDR understands that the construction window for the Alternative E-1A – RSSOption is a period of 17 months. A 3-month window for the initial drawdown was assumed to allow the remaining 14 months for roadway construction within the pit. Maintenance dewatering would continue through a portion of the 14-month roadway construction period. Based on a total dewatering volume of 2.65 billion gallons, the rate required to drop the pit water level 30 feet in 3 months is approximately 20,450 gallons per minute (gpm) or 29.4 million gallons per day (MGD). This discharge rate was then increased by the maximum additional groundwater inflow induced by the dewatering, an additional 3,400 gpm. This resulted in an estimated initial drawdown discharge rate of or 23,850 gpm or 34.3MGD. The groundwater model shows that lowering the pit level and maintaining it at 30 feet below steady state conditions during construction would induce up to a maximum additional inflow of 3,400 gpm into the pit (i.e., the initial inflow rate in Table 4.1). This rate assumes that the City of Virginia and ArcelorMittal would continue to draw water from the pit during the construction period. However, as described in Section 8.2.2 the 30-foot drop in water level in the Rouchleau Pit would render the ArcelorMittal pumping system inoperable. The pumping rates should, therefore, be increased to reflect the rate normally withdrawn by ArcelorMittal. This would increase the initial dewatering rate and the maintenance rate by 2,000 gpm, ArcelorMittal’s maximum permitted withdrawal rate, to arate of25,850 gpm. Based on the schedule provided by MnDOT, the embankment will reach a height greater than the initial water surface elevation of 1,305 feet several months into construction. For the purposes of this report, it was assumed that dewatering operations would continue for 9 months after the initial 3-month drawdown period, for a total dewatering period of 12 months. It is possible that maintenance dewatering equipment could operate during the initial 3-month drawdown period to supplement withdrawals by the main drawdown pumps. It is also possible that maintenance dewatering could be discontinued earlier in the construction process to allow groundwater to re-inundate the mine pit as construction of the embankment progresses. A summary of the estimated dewatering rates is provided in Table 5.1. A concept to mitigate the effects of dewatering on ArcelorMittal and the supply to the Enterprise Pit and Sauntry Creek system is described in Section 6.1. Table5.1 EstimatedDewateringRates for Rouchleau Pit Period  Estimated Dewatering Rate (gpm)  Initial Drawdown Dewatering (3-months)  25,850  Maintenance Dewatering (9 months)  5,400*  * 5,400 is the maximum projected inflow rate during the maintenance dewatering period TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  p. 6  5.2. TRANSFERWATERQUALITY 5.2.1. WATERQUALITYOFTHEROUCHLEAUPIT Information on the quality of the Rouchleau Pit water was obtained from drinking water quality reports prepared by the Virginia Public Utilities as part of its water quality testing and monitoring program. This information is summarized in Table 8.1 as part of the evaluation of the effect of dewatering on the Virginia water intake and treatment system. As noted in Section 8.1, the overall quality of water in the Rouchleau Pit is good, with no identified impairments that would be a concern regarding transferring the water to other water bodies. 5.2.2. ASSESSMENTOFAQUATICINVASIVESPECIES HDR conducted a preliminary review of the potential for aquatic invasive species (AIS) in the Rouchleau Pit to determine if AIS would present an issue when considering discharge from the dewatering operations. HDR reviewed the Minnesota Department of Natural Resource’s (MnDNR) Designation of Infested Waters to assess the potential for AIS. Based on the review, no assessment of the presence/absence of AIS in the Rouchleau Pit by the MnDNR has occurred. There is no public access to the Rouchleau Pit, which minimizes the likelihood of human transport of AIS to the pit, or presence of AIS in the water. The MnDNR’s Designation of Infested Waters has listed nearby Gilbert Pit (Ore-be-gone Lake), which has a public boating access, as infested with Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussels. It is unlikely that a transfer of AIS/water from Gilbert Pit to the Rouchleau Pit has occurred. Any water removed from the Rouchleau Pit will likely not contain AIS, and as a result any receiving waters are not in danger of receiving AIS from the Rouchleau Pit. 5.3. DEWATERINGTRANSFERLOCATIONS Fifteen potential locations for the dewatering transfer were identified using aerial mapping data and with input from MnDOT, MnDNR, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), the City of Virginia, Virginia Department of Public Utilities, ArcelorMittal, Cliffs Natural Resources and Minntac. The potential locations and distances from the Rouchleau Pit are summarized in Table 5.2 and shown on Figure 3. Each of the options was evaluated based on DNR staff assessment of the capacity of each water body to receive the dewatering transfer volumes and rates, potential permitting implications associated with a potential water transfer, and other noted considerations. Issues that were identified during the evaluation process that made transfer locations problematic are noted in boldin Table 5.2. TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  p. 7  Table5.2 PotentialDewateringTransfer Locations Location  Description  Evaluation  Sauntry Creek system including Bailey and Silver Lakes  Sauntry Creek system supplemented with diversion from Rouchleau Pit via Enterprise Pit.

Preliminary DNR assessment indicates that the river has capacity to receive rate and volume from initial drawdown and maintenance dewatering. Would be considered water transfer and would not require water quality permitting. Recommendation:Not carried forward as option for watertransfer.  As noted previously, the options for discharge of the Rouchleau Pit dewatering operations were analyzed for their capacity to receive the initial drawdown and/or maintenance dewatering water volume and rates, and the potential water appropriations and water quality permit requirements and implications. Evaluation Results: Initial Drawdown Receiving Waters Many of the options for the transfer of the initial drawdown water were eliminated due to their inability to accommodate either the total volume or the high flow rate associated with the 3month period allocated for the initial dewatering. These include the Sauntry Creek system, Manganika Creek, Manganika Lake, Mashkenode Lake, East Two River and Ore-Be-Gone Lake. The UTAC Hull/Spruce Hill Pit complex and the Enterprise Pit were removed from consideration as options for the initial drawdown volume because of the potential for interference with mining operations. Two other options were removed from consideration because the proposed water transfer and introduction of a new water source could trigger major modification or re-issuance of an existing National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. These included the Minntac Mountain Iron Pit, and the UTAC South Pit. The Pike River was eliminated for either discharge because it would require negotiation of an inter-basin transfer agreement under the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact (Great Lakes Compact) for a new water use, which would not fit within the project schedule. Ely Lake was removed from consideration due to uncertainty of the ability of the outlet to handle the increased volume and outflows, and the risk of water level rise on a highly developed shoreline. The St. Louis River is not recommended at this time because there are other potentially viable alternatives closer to the Rouchleau Pit (describedbelow) that appear to be feasible. The options that are recommended for further consideration for the initial dewatering period are the WestTwo River Reservoir andthe Minntac Tailings Basin Cell2. The West Two River Reservoir is located approximately 5.5 miles west of Rouchleau Pit. It was created in 1963 by US Steel to be used as a water source for mining operations and processing. The reservoir has natural inlets and receives discharges from Minntac dewatering operations. There are two outlets from the reservoir to West Two River, including a fixed-head dam and a siphon-controlled outlet. The siphon, which was included as part of the permit that allowed establishment of the reservoir, provides a minimum flow of 3 cubic feet per second to West Two River to maintain a minimum base flow below the reservoir. West Two River eventually flows into the St. Louis River. TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  p. 11  Initial analysis of the West Two River Reservoir shows that it has capacity to take a large portion of the volume associated with the initial drawdown transfer. Depending on water level and conditions at the time of the transfer, the additional volume will be accommodated by available storage within the reservoir, and any excess will discharge over the dam, increasing the flow in West Two River. Assessment by MnDNR of historic streamflow conditions in West Two River indicates that the river could handle the temporary increase in flow that would result. MnDNR has also indicated that due to the temporary nature of any increase in outflow from the reservoir, stream erosion is not an issue. Transfer of water from the Rouchleau Pit to West Two River reservoir would require a new water appropriation permit (issued to MnDOT). This dewatering option would be considered a water transfer and would not be subject to MPCA water quality permitting, provided that there was no intervening commercial or industrial use of the water and no pollutants were introduced during transfer of the water. The Minntac Tailings Basin Cell 2 is located approximately six miles northwest of the Rouchleau Pit. Water and tailings are discharged into the tailings basin. There is no discharge outlet from the tailings basin. Under current operations, water from the basin is re-circulated to the plant to be used as mine process water. According to US Steel, the Minntac Tailings basin has capacity to receive the volume associated with the initial drawdown. Although transfer from the Rouchleau Pit to the tailings basin would, constitute an inter-basin transfer under the Great Lakes Compact, the diversion would be covered by the existing baseline diversion. The transfer would likely require an administrative amendment to US Steel Minntac’s permit (1963-0846) to include the Rouchleau Pit as a water source. A new appropriation permit would not be required. Cell 2 is part of an existing NPDES permit. A transfer of water from the Rouchleau Pit to this option would require an NPDES permitting action, however, the quality of water to be transferred would be expected to improve the water quality within Minntac’ s basin. MnDOT conducted water quality testing of the Rouchleau Pit water to document current conditions in March 2014 and May 2014. Results are summarized in Table 5.3. Evaluation Results: Maintenance Dewatering Receiving Waters The recommended receiving waters for the maintenance dewatering period are the Enterprise Pit and the Sauntry Creek system, given their ability to handle the maintenance flow rate and the potential benefit of being able to mitigate for drawdown impacts, as discussed in more detail in Section 8.2. The Enterprise Pit is located approximately one quarter mile north of the Rouchleau Pit. It is an inundated former mine pit with no natural outlet. ArcelorMittal has an appropriation permit to pump water from the Enterprise Pit by for use at Minorca mine. ArcelorMittal also has an appropriation permit to pump water from the Rouchleau Pit into the Enterprise Pit to maintain the water level in the Enterprise Pit. The existing ArcelorMittal withdrawal system that pumps water from Rouchleau Pit into the Enterprise Pit has the ability to divert flow into the Sauntry Creek system. This diversion is used periodically to augment Bailey and Silver Lakes in the City of Virginia. TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  p. 12  Table5.3 Rouchleau PitWater QualityTestResults Parameter  Units  Results (3/13/14)  Results (5/29/14)  Mercury, Low Level  ng/L  ND  8.2  Aluminum  µg/L  ND  ND  Calcium  mg/L  53.5  49.8  Iron  µg/L  ND  ND  Magnesium  mg/L  38.6  36.6  Manganese  µg/L  ND  ND  Sodium  mg/L  17.4  16.6  Total Hardness by 2340B  mg/L  293  275  Field pH  Std.

PERMITTING This section describes anticipated permitting for the dewatering location options recommended for further consideration. 5.4.1. APPROPRIATIONS Water use, including transfers of water and dewatering for construction, are managed by the MnDNR through the water appropriation permit program. The MnDNR can include conditions in the permit requirements, if deemed necessary, to minimize and/or mitigate potential impacts. The MnDNR is authorized to issue long-term appropriation permits for individual uses that exceed daily and annual use volumes, and has a General Permit (19970005) which authorizes temporary appropriations including dewatering for construction activities. Water uses that meet the requirements for an Individual Appropriation Permit (i.e., if volumes exceed the General Permit conditions) must complete an application for review from MnDNR. Minnesota statutes allow local units of government 30 days to review appropriation permit applications. A transfer of water from the Rouchleau Pit to accommodate construction of the Alternative E-1A – RSS Option would require either a new MnDNR individual water appropriation permit, a temporary construction dewatering permit, or a modification to an existing MnDNR water appropriation permit, depending on the receiving water. A transfer of water from the Rouchleau Pit to the West Two River Reservoir would likely require a new MnDNR water appropriation permit. In this case, MnDOT would apply for the new permit and would be required to complete an application for review from MnDNR. Minnesota statutes allow local units of government 30 days to review appropriation permit applications. Although there is no formal public review period for appropriation permits information and documentation submitted withthe application form is public information. A transfer from the Rouchleau Pit to the Minntac Tailings Basin Cell 2 would likely require an administrative amendment to US Steel Minntac’s permit (1963-0846) to include the Rouchleau Pit as a water source. A new appropriation permit would not be required. Once the EIS documentation was deemed adequate, an administrative amendment could be pursued by Minntac. A temporary MnDNR water appropriation permit would be required for transferring water from the Rouchleau Pit to the Enterprise Pit. MnDOT would apply for the temporary construction dewatering permit through MnDNR. 5.4.2. WATERQUALITY The MPCA regulates the discharge of wastewater to receiving waters of the state and operation of wastewater disposal systems through its NPDES/SDS water quality permitting program. It does not regulate transfers of water, as defined by federal law, from one water body to another that does not involve an intervening commercial or industrial use or the introduction of pollutants. Determination of whether or not NPDES/SDS permits would be required by MPCA for the transfer of water from the Rouchleau Pit to any receiving water body considered will depend on a number of factors. These include water quality comparisons, water management practices, concentration and loading determinations, whether there is an intervening use of the water or pollutants are added during the transfer, and whether or not the receiving water is part of an existing NPDES/SDS permit. TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  p. 14  Initial assessment by the MPCA indicates that the quality of the Rouchleau Pit water is good, and water quality concerns are not anticipated for any of the potential receiving waters retained for further consideration (Enterprise Pit/Sauntry Creek system, West Two River Reservoir and Minntac Tailings Basin Cell 2). Dewatering activities that occur during the initial drawdown period would likely be considered a water transfer and would not require an MPCA NPDES/SDS permit. Maintenance dewatering during construction would likely be considered a transfer, and not a discharge, as long as the quality of the water is not adversely affected by construction activities. The ultimate determination of water quality permitting requirements will depend on the impact of construction activities on the quality of the Rouchleau Pit water, and how effectively potential impacts are minimized or mitigated. The Enterprise Pit and the West Two River Reservoir are not part of an existing NPDES/SDS permits and could receive a water transfer without specific NPDES/SDS permitting action. Minntac’s Tailings Basin Cell 2 is part of an existing NPDES/SDS permit. Therefore, a transfer of water from the Rouchleau Pit would require an NPDES/SDS permitting action. However, the quality of water to be transferred is expected to improve the water quality within Minntac’s basin. MnDOT conducted water quality testing in March and May 2014. Results are summarized in Table 5.3, above. 5.4.3. ST. LAWRENCE–GREATLAKESCOMPACT The Great Lakes Compact prohibits diversion of water from the Great Lakes Basin. The compact was adopted in 2005 and signed into law in 2008. Within five years of the compact adoption, a list of existing withdrawals, diversions, and consumptive uses were submitted by each state to establish a baseline for determining new or increased withdrawals, diversions, and consumptive uses. Within the list submitted by the State of Minnesota was US Steel Minntac’s water appropriation permit 1963-0846 which authorizes a volume of 24.1 million gallons per day (8.797 billion gallons per year (BGY))11 as part of the baseline diversions. Under the Minntac Cell 2 option, movement of water from the Rouchleau Pit to the Minntac Tailings Basin would constitute an inter-basin transfer. The Rouchleau Pit lies within the St. Louis River watershed, which is part of the St. Lawrence – Great Lakes basin. The Minntac Cell 2 lies within the Little Fork watershed, which is part of the Hudson Bay basin. A transfer of water from the Rouchleau Pit to the Minntac Tailings basin would constitute a transfer of water out of the Lake Superior Watershed, and would normally require regional review and exemption through the Great Lakes Compact process. However, because water transferred out of the Lake Superior watershed by Minntac was identified as part of Minnesota’s baseline diversion, and is below the permitted 8.797 billion gallons per year, MnDNR officials have indicated that a transfer from the Rouchleau Pit to the Minntac Tailings Basin Cell2 wouldbe allowed under the current baseline diversion. 11Minnesota DNR Appropriation Permit #1963-0846 TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  p. 15  Implementation of this option would require an administrative amendment to Minntac’s existing water appropriation permit to include the Rouchleau Pit as a water source. A new appropriation permit would not be required. Once the EIS documentation was deemed adequate, an administrative amendment could be pursued by Minntac. 5.4.4. STORMWATER The construction of the proposed Alternative E-1A –RSS Option will require a NPDES/SDS Construction Stormwater activity permit, which may be covered under the State’s Construction Stormwater General Permit. As part of the application process, the owner and operator must create a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) that explains how stormwater will be controlled to prevent introduction of sediment and other pollutants transported by runoff. The control of runoff from construction that occurs during the dewatering period will factor into the MPCA’s review and determination that the dewatering operations can be classified as a water transfer, which does not require a NPDES discharge permit. 6. CONCEPTUAL-LEVELDESIGNOFDEWATERINGSYSTEM Conceptual layouts and preliminary costs for the dewatering system were completed for both the West Two River Reservoir and Minntac Tailing Basin Cell 2 options for the initial drawdown transfer, and for the Enterprise Pit/Sauntry Creek option for the maintenance dewatering transfer. 6.1. CONCEPTUALLAYOUTANDOPERATIONSOFDEWATERINGSYSTEM In configuring the layouts for the dewatering system, consideration was given to the location and capacity of receiving waters, feasibility of pipeline routes, flexibility and redundancy of operations, and maintenance of existing water uses. MnDOT developed preliminary pipeline routes for the dewatering options, described in greater detail in Sections 6.1.1 through 6.1.3. The dewatering system configurations include two separate installations. Both installations would consist of temporary diesel-powered pumping stations and associated suction and discharge piping. A larger system was designed to operate during the initial 3-month drawdown period. Options for transfer from the Rouchleau Pit to West Two River Reservoir and to Minntac Tailings Basin Cell 2 were developed for comparison. Pumps and pipeline sizes for these alternatives were based on the dewatering rate of 25,850 gpm to accommodate transfer of the entire drawdown volume to the receiving water during the initial 3-month drawdown period. The smaller maintenance dewatering system was configured to pump the estimated maintenance dewatering rate of 5,400 gpm from the Rouchleau Pit to the Enterprise Pit/Sauntry Creek system for a 12-month period, including the 3-month initial drawdown period, and 9-month maintenance dewatering period. The systems were designed with the ability to operate together during the initial 3-month drawdown period to provide flexibility in discharge routing and flow rate, and redundancy of operation. Once the initial drawdown is accomplished, the larger pump station and pipelines could be taken out of service. 6.1.1 TRANSFERTOWESTTWORIVERRESERVOIR West Two River Reservoir is located approximately 5.5 miles west of the Rouchleau Pit. The dewatering system that would transfer water from the Rouchleau Pit to the West Two River Reservoir would include a bank of six 4,500 gpm pumps and three 30-inch HDPE discharge pipes. The pumps would be installed in the southwest corner of the Rouchleau Pit near the current water surface. TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  p. 16  Discharge piping would be routed above ground, primarily in existing road and railroad right-of-way. The pipeline would leave the Alternative E-1A – RSS Option project area crossing under existing US 53 via existing bridges near 2nd Avenue and would follow US 53 right-of-way to US 169. The pipe would extend along the south side of US 169 to an existing power line corridor just north of the reservoir. The pipe would follow the power line corridor south to the reservoir. At the discharge point, flow dissipation would be installed to minimize erosion. The route is shown in Figure 4. The total length of the discharge route is approximately 5.7 miles. The elevation along this route varies from 1,275 feet at the low water level to a maximum elevation of 1,465 feet approximately 3.25 miles into the route. Total head conditions assumed for this route are estimated at 314 feet. 6.1.2 TRANSFERTOMINNTACTAILINGSBASINCELL2 The Minntac Tailings Basin Cell 2 is located approximately six miles northwest of the Rouchleau Pit. The dewatering system that would transfer water from the Rouchleau Pit to Cell 2 of the Minntac Tailings basin would be installed in the northwest end of the Rouchleau Pit and include a bank of six 4,500 gpm pumps located near the current water surface. Three 30-inch HDPE discharge pipes would be routed above-ground from the Rouchleau Pit. At approximately 2.5 miles into the route, the flow would be boosted through another bank of six 4,500 gpm pumps and then routed through three 30-inch HDPE pipes to the discharge point. At the discharge flow dissipation would be installed to reduce energy and minimize erosion. Discharge piping would be routed above ground, primarily in existing road and railroad right-of-way, although easement through several private parcels would be required along the route near the Rouchleau Pit. From the Rouchleau Pit, several potential route configurations have been identified to take the pipeline across the ArcelorMittal property. These include existing mine access roads. Other options for the route on the east side of TH 53 could include segments along a power line corridor, existing access roads, TH 53 rightof-way, or railroad right-of-way. On the west side of TH 53 where the power line meets the Minntac mine road at the tailings basin, the pipe would follow the east side of the mine road, then cross under the mine road to the west side near Cell 1. The pipe would follow the edge of Cell1, until it reaches Cell2. The routes (and variations) are shown in Figure 5. The total length of the main discharge route used to determine costs is 8.9 miles. The elevation along this route varies from 1,275 feet at the low water level to a maximum elevation of 1,855 feet approximately 5.5 miles into the route. Total head conditions for this route are estimated at 766 feet. 6.1.3 TRANSFERTOENTERPRISEPIT/SAUNTRYCREEK The Enterprise Pit is located immediately north of the Rouchleau Pit. The dewatering system that would transfer water from the Rouchleau Pit to the Enterprise Pit would be installed on the north end of the Rouchleau Pit. It would be designed to discharge approximately 5,400 gpm to the Enterprise Pit with an option to divert flow to the Sauntry Creek system. This configuration would help control the water level in the Enterprise Pit, mitigate the effects of dewatering the Rouchleau Pit on the existing ArcelorMittal water management operations (see Section 8.2), and maintain the ability to augment water flow to Bailey and Silver Lakes in the City of Virginia. Three 4,500 gpm pumps would be located near the Rouchleau Pit water surface. The use of three pumps provides flexibility in operation and redundancy in the event one pump were taken out of service during the pumping period. TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  p. 17  Discharge piping would be routed above ground, paralleling the existing ArcelorMittal discharge piping and make use of the existing diversion structure, if possible. The total length of the discharge route is 1,320 feet. The route is shown on both Figures 4 and 5. The land along the proposed route is owned by RGGS Land and Minerals, Ltd. At the discharge point, flow dissipation wouldbe installedto reduce discharge energy and minimize erosion. The maintenance dewatering system would be in place for the 3-month initial dewatering period and be kept in place for an estimated 9 months following initial drawdown. It is possible that the dewatering activities could be discontinued and groundwater allowed to recharge the pit earlier as construction ofthe embankment progresses. 6.2. COSTESTIMATES Cost estimates were developed for two dewatering alternatives. The first includes the option to transfer water from the initial drawdown of the Rouchleau Pit to the West Two River Reservoir and discharge the maintenance dewatering system to the Enterprise Pit/Sauntry Creek system. The second includes the option to transfer water from the initial drawdown of the Rouchleau Pit to Minntac Tailings Basin Cell 2, with maintenance dewatering discharged to the Enterprise Pit/Sauntry Creek system. Cost estimates for both options include the set-up of two separate temporarypumping stations, pump rental, suction and discharge pipe rental, and diesel fuel costs. Mobilization for each option was estimated at 4 percent of construction costs. An additional 15 percent contingency was included in the preliminary design estimate to cover undeveloped design details. Costs for part-time (12-hour) pump and pipeline monitoring during the duration of the dewatering operation were included. 6.2.1.

Under this option, seven 4,500 gpm drawdown pumps (6 operating and 1 spare) and three 4,500 gpm maintenance pumps (2 operating and 1 spare) were included in the estimate. The estimate includes a 3-month initial drawdown period and 9 months of maintenance pumping. It was assumed that the maintenance pumping system would be operational for the 3-month drawdown period in addition to the 9-month maintenance dewatering period. It was also assumed that after the initial 3-month drawdown period, the drawdown pumps could be taken out of service. A detailed breakdown of the costs is included in Table 6.1.

The cost estimates presented in the previous section assumed a time period of 3 months for the initial drawdown, and 9 additional months of maintenance dewatering. Additional analyses compared these costs with costs associated with a12-month initialdrawdown period with transfer to the WestTwo River Reservoir and Minntac Cell 2 transfer locations. Under both scenarios, the maintenance dewatering would be directed to the Enterprise Pit/Sauntry Creek system. Another set of analyses examined the costs associated with transferring both the initial dewatering volume and maintenance flow to the SauntryCreek system via the Enterprise Pit. A range of costs was computed for several flow rate and time period scenarios for transfer of the initial drawdown volume to the Enterprise Pit/SauntryCreek system (3,800 gpm for 24 months, 7,400 gpm for 10 months and 8,900 gpm for 8 months). The flow rate and duration for the maintenance period for all options were kept at5,400 gpm and 12 months to maintain consistency between these and the WestTwo River Reservoir and Minntac Cell 2 options. Cost estimates for these scenarios included similar assumptions as those computed in the previous section. Estimates include the set-up of temporary pumping stations, pump rental, suction and discharge pipe rental, and diesel fuel costs. Mobilization for each option was estimated at4 percent of construction costs. An additional 15 percent contingency was included in the preliminary design estimate to cover undeveloped design details. Costs for part-time (12hour) pump and pipeline monitoring during the duration of the dewatering operation were included. Costs associated with the extended dewatering periods, and the transfer of the drawdown volume to the Sauntry Creek system via the Enterprise Pit at various flow rates are summarized in Table 6.3 below. Options shown in the first two rows represent the 3-month initial drawdown and 12-month total dewatering period scenarios detailed in the previous section. These are shown for comparison. The analysis shows that extending the initial drawdown period to 12 months would reduce the drawdown pumping rate to 6,200 gpm and would reduce costs by approximately $5 million (33 percent) for the West Two River Reservoir option and approximately $9.5 million (40 percent) for the Minntac Cell 2 option. Costs range from $4.14 million to $5.95 million for the three pumping systems that would transfer the entire drawdown volume into the Enterprise Pit/Sauntry Creek system. The time periods range from 20 months for a system that divert flow at an estimated rate of 8,900 gpm to 36 months for a system that would divert flow at a rate of 3,800 gpm. For all three of these options, maintenance pumping would also be pumped to the Enterprise Pit/Sauntry Creek system. TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  p. 22  Table6.3 Alternative CostAnalyses DrawdownTransfer Option(Initial/ Maintenance)  Initial Draw-down Period (months)  Initial Draw-down Period Flow Rate (gpm)  Maintenance Dewatering Period (months)  Total Dewatering Period (months)  Cost (millions)  West Two River Reservoir, Enterprise Pit/ Sauntry Creek  3  25,850  9  12  $15.2  Minntac Cell 2, Enterprise Pit/ Sauntry Creek  3  25,850  9  12  $23.1  West Two River Reservoir, Enterprise Pit/ Sauntry Creek  12  6,200  12  24  $10.14  Minntac Cell 2, Enterprise Pit/ Sauntry Creek  12  6,200  12  24  $13.65  Enterprise Pit/ Sauntry Creek  24  3,800  12  36  $5.95  Enterprise Pit/ Sauntry Creek  10  7,400  12  22  $4.51  Enterprise Pit/ Sauntry Creek  8  8,900  12  20  $4.14  6.4. ANALYSISOFCOSTS-2014WATERLEVELINTHEROUCHLEAUPIT The water level in the Rouchleau Pit was measured at 1,310 byMnDOT in May 2014. To determine the potential impact of higher water on the estimated costs for dewatering, HDR recomputed the water volume and dewatering rate that would be required to lower the pit water level to 1,275 feet in the same 3-monthdrawdown period assumed in the initial cost analysis. The bathymetric surveydata collected by MnDOT in the fall of 2013 was used to revise the water volume associated with a drop in water surface elevation from 1,310feet to 1,275 feet. The volume was calculated to be 3.17 billion gallons, an increase of513 million gallons over the volume associated with an initial water surface elevation of 1,305feet. Adjusting for the maximum additional groundwater inflow inducedbythe dewatering, and projected pumping from the pit, a revised dewatering rate of or 29,825gpm or 36.9 MGD was calculated. This is an increase of 3,975 gpm over the dewatering rate associated with the pit water surface elevation of 1,305feet. Dewatering volumes and rates associated with the two initial water surface elevations are shown in Table 6.4. TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  p. 23  Table6.4 EstimatedDewateringRates for the RouchleauPit Initial Elevation 1,305 feet  Initial Elevation 1,310 feet  Volume to dewater to Elevation 1,275 (billion gallons)  2.65  3.17  (1) Dewatering Rate(gpm)  25,850  29,825  (1) Dewatering rate adjusted to include maximum groundwater inflow of 3,400 gpm and exclude 2,000 gpm withdrawal by ArcelorMittal. The conceptual design and cost estimates for the West Two Rivers and Minntac Cell 2 discharge options developed in the previous sections assumed the installation banks ofpumps feeding into three 30-inch pipes. Six pumps and1 spare were included in the cost estimates for both options. The Minntac Cell2 option included additional banks of booster pumps along the pipe route to meet the higher head conditions associated with this alignment. The increase in pumping rate to 29,825gpm would require the pumps to operate at a higher rate, and would require an additional pump for the West Two Rivers option. This increased the costs from $15.2 million to $15.5 million an increase of approximately $300,000. For the Minntac Cell2 option, the pumps would operate at a higher rate, and three additional booster pumps wouldbe required to meet the head conditions. An additional pump would not be required at the main pump station. These changes would result increase the estimated costs from $23.1 million to $24.1 million, an increase of approximately$1 million.

Most of these wells are installed in the glacial drift and Virginia Argillite formations. Comparatively few wells are installed in the Biwabik Formation in this area. Table 7.1 contains a list of water supply wells that are installed in the Biwabik Formation within approximately one mile of the pit. These wells are also shown on Figure 6 in the Appendix. The list includes one well installed by the City of Virginia near the steam plant on the south side of Silver Lake that is open to the Biwabik Formation from 118 to 450 feet; this well is not in use. The City of Mountain Iron has two wells open to the Biwabik Formation from 160 to 375 feet and 160 to 425 feet, each pumping about 114 gpm annually (Walsh, 2009). These wells are about four miles west of the Rouchleau Pit. The intake sections of these wells are below the depth of dewatering proposed for the TH53Alternative E-1A –RSS Option. Table7.1 BiwabikFormation Water SupplyWells Township-Range-Section  Unique Well ID  Name  Use  Depth (ft)  Bottom Elevation (ft MSL)  58-17-08  476180  Virginia 1*  Municipal  288  n/a  58-17-08  476181  Virginia 2*  Municipal  287  n/a  58-17-10  534407  St. Louis Co.

Simulated groundwater levels indicate that the effects of dewatering will be limited to the immediate area around the pit. Local groundwater levels in the Biwabik Formation will decline approximately 10 to 20 feet within one mile of the pit, with the effects decreasing with distance from the pit. The dewatering anticipated for the project and resulting impact on groundwater levels is not expected to cause an issue with operation of wells in the Biwabik Formation within 1 mile of the Rouchleau Pit. The 10 to 20 foot decline in the groundwater levels in the area is not expected to drop water levels to within the intake areas of the existing wells. It is also important to note that the pit has historically had much lower water elevations than 1,275 feet (for example, the pit water surface elevation was approximately 1,240 feet in 2000) with no reported interference with local wells. The water level in the Rouchleau Pit has historically been influenced by pumping, either as part of mining operations, or by the City of Virginia. If all pumping were to cease in the pit, the pit water level could equilibrate to an elevation similar to that in the nearby City of Virginia power plant well (unused), which is installed in the Biwabik Formation. Recorded groundwater elevations in the well include 1,396 feet in November 1996 and 1,428 feet in June 1982 (HDR, 1997). The ultimate water level in the pit would depend on dewatering activities in the Biwabik Formation by other mines in the area. TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  p. 25  7.1. PITRECHARGEAFTERCONSTRUCTION Once construction activities are completed and the dewatering systems are shut down, the water level in the Rouchleau Pit will eventually rise back to its normal operating starting elevation near 1,305 feet provided no new stresses (e.g., increased City pumping) are introduced. The time to refill the pit from 1,275 feet to 1,305 feet was estimated using two different methods. The results of the analyses are shown in Table 7.2. The first method used the results of the groundwater model and assumed that the aquifer was ‘ideal’, where the pit recovery rate mimics the pit drawdown rate. In this case the pit recharges at 3,400 gpm initially, and slows to 2,060 gpm after about 7 months as the aquifer recovers and the hydraulic gradient flattens. Using this method, about 70 percent of the dewatered pit volume would be recovered after 19 months, which roughly corresponds to a pit water surface elevation of1,296 feet;100 percent recovery would occur in approximately28 months. The second method to estimate pit recharge used Darcy’s Law (an empirical relationship used to calculate flow through an aquifer) and pit bathymetry, along with starting and ending hydraulic gradients estimated from the drawdown contours in the groundwater model. A starting (dewatered condition) hydraulic gradient of 0.008, and ending (refilled condition) hydraulic gradient of 0.006 were estimated, and Darcy’s Law was then used to calculate the time to refill the pit water surface in 1-foot increments. Using this method, about 70 percent of the dewatered pit volume was recovered after 22 months and 100 percent recovery occurred in approximately 33 months. All calculations assumed that the City of Virginia and ArcelorMittal maintain their current pumping rates. The recovery of the pit water level is directly related to pumping withdrawals; increases in pumping would slow the recovery of the pit water level, while decreases in pumping would hasten recovery. TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  p. 26  Table7.2 Rouchleau PitWater LevelRecovery Pit Water Surface Elevation (ft MSL)  Time SinceEnd of Dewatering(months)  ‘Ideal’Aquifer RechargeMethod  Darcy Recharge Method  1,275  0  0  1,280  4  4  1,285  8  9  1,290  13  14  1,295  18  20  1,300  23  26  1,305  28  33  8. DEWATERINGEFFECTSONEXISTINGROUCHLEAUPITWATERUSERS There are two water intakes locatedin the Rouchleau Pit. The City of Virginia uses the Rouchleau Pit as its raw water source for the City’s drinking water system and to supply cooling water to the Virginia Public Utilities’ power plant. ArcelorMittal pumps water out of the northeast end of the Rouchleau Pit to supplement the water storage in the Enterprise Pit that provides potable and process water for the Minorca Mine operations. ArcelorMittal also diverts a portion of the flow to supplement the Sauntry Creek system, which flows into Bailey Lake and Silver Lake in the City of Virginia. Consideration was given to the water availability, water quality, operations, and permitting effects of the temporary dewatering. The existing intake facilities and the water surface elevation at the current level (1,305 feet) andthe proposed elevation of 1,275 feet are shown on Figure 6. 8.1. CITYOFVIRGINIA 8.1.1. DESCRIPTIONOFWATERSUPPLYSYSTEM Virginia Public Utilities provides potable water to approximately 13,000 people and businesses in Virginia and a portion if Mountain Iron12 . Source water is obtained from the Rouchleau Pit, which is located within the Virginia City limits approximately one-half mile east of the city's water treatment plant. The Virginia water intake consists of a horizontal drift into the pit that feeds two vertical wells, from which raw water is pumped to the 12 NTS, Water Treatment Facility TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  p. 27  treatment plant.13 (See Figure 6) The pumping station is located on City-owned land on the west side of the pit, near Chestnut Street The water treatment plant, constructed in 2001, can treat a maximum of five million gallons per day (MGD) and has a treated water reservoir with a storage capacity of 4.5 million gallons (MG). Average demand is approximately 1.7 MGD; maximum daily demand is 3.1 MGD. The conventional water treatment plant includes coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, gravity filtration, fluoridation, corrosion control, and disinfection (Figure 7).14 The treatment plant is producing water that meets the federal and state drinking water standards.15 8.1.2. HISTORICWATERSYSTEMSUSCEPTIBILITY The Minnesota Department of Health, with the help of Virginia Public Utilities, completed a Source Water Assessment for the City of Virginia in 2003 in accordance with the 1996 Amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act. The assessment included the geologic setting of the Rouchleau iron ore pit and concluded that very little surface water runoff enters the water body. The large volume of water in the Rouchleau Pit helps to attenuate contaminant concentration and also affects the movement of contaminants to the public water supply intake. However, MDH has determined the susceptibility of the Rouchleau Pit to be high because there are no practical means of preventing all potential contaminant releases into the surface water. The Source Water Assessment identified the contaminants of greatest concern to the Virginia water supply to include: manganese; molybdenum and other metals; arsenic; bromine; fluoride; oils; fuels; solvents; sedimentation; microorganisms; and turbidity.16 The city's water plant has effectively treated this source water to meet or exceed safe drinking water standards.17 8.1.3. WATERQUALITY Table 8.1 lists water quality data collected on November 27, 201218 and is considered to be representative of the City’s raw water quality. In terms of water quality, there is no indication that changes in water treatment will be necessary during the dewatering activities. An increase in turbidity and suspended solids could be observed during this time resulting from disruption of settled materials in the pit. However, the physical plant appears to provide the appropriate water treatment equipment to meet increases in turbidity and suspended solids especially given the plant’s design capacity of 5 MGD compared with current average and maximum day water demands of 1.7 MGD and 3.1 MGD, respectively. The excess capacity provides flexibility for operators to make appropriate adjustments. 13 Source Water Assessment, 2003 14 NTS, Water Treatment Facility 15 Consumer Confidence Report, 2012 16 Source Water Assessment, 2003 17 Source Water Assessment, 2003 18 Pace Analytical, 2012 TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  p. 28  Table8.1 Source Water QualityforVirginia, Mn Parameter  Measured Concentration  Maximum Contaminant Limit (MCL)  Secondary Maximum Contaminant Limit (SMCL)  Physical  pH  7.5  n/a  6.5 – 8.5  Specific Conductance  690 µmhos/cm  n/a  n/a  Total Dissolved Solids  369 mg/L  n/a  500 mg/L  Total Suspended Solids  1.2 mg/L  99.9% removal of particles 3µm and larger  n/a  Turbidity  n/a  Turbidity <1.0 NTU 100% of samples and≤0.3 NTU in 95% of samples  n/a  Cations  Aluminum  ND  n/a  n/a  Calcium  59.1 mg/L  n/a  n/a  Hardness, Calcium  148 mg/L as CaCO3  n/a  n/a  Hardness, Total  318 mg/L as CaCO3  n/a  n/a  Iron  ND  n/a  0.3 mg/L  Magnesium  41.3 mg/L  n/a  n/a  Manganese  62.4 µg/L  n/a  50 µg/L  Sodium  15.9 mg/L  n/a  250 mg/L  Ammonia  ND  n/a  n/a  Anions  Alkalinity, Total  239 mg/L as CaCO3  n/a  n/a  Alkalinity, Bicarbonate  239 mg/L as CaCO3  n/a  n/a  Chloride  33.0 mg/L  n/a  250 mg/L  Fluoride  0.17 mg/L  4.0 mg/L  2.0 mg/L  Nitrate  0.13 mg/L as N  10 mg/L as N  n/a  Nitrite  ND  1 mg/L as N  n/a  Sulfate  54.9 mg/L  n/a  250 mg/L  Microbiological  Total Coliforms  Present  5.0%  n/a  E. coli Bacteria  Absent  Present  n/a  Notes: n/a indicates no standard is established.

OPERATIONS Lowering the water level in the Rouchleau Pit will have minimal effects on the raw water pumps that supply the Virginia Public Utilities’ water treatment plant. The submerged intake for the raw water pumps is at elevation 1,117 feet. With a 30 foot drawdown of the pit, the water surface elevation in the pit is projected to be as low as 1,275 feet during the earliest part of construction of the embankment. Although this does not violate the minimum water elevation of 1,123 feet established at the time of construction of the pumphouse19 it will change the head conditions under which the pumps operate. The raw water pumping system is made up of two 8-stage vertical turbine pumps designed for 2,000 gpm each at 350 to 360 feet of total dynamic head. The increase in total head resulting from the lowered pit depth will shift the operating point on the pump curve. With higher head conditions, the pump capacity would be reduced from 2,000 gpm to 1,800 gpm and the efficiency is lowered from 83 percent to approximately 81 percent. Although the energy required per gallon of water pumped increases slightly the overall horsepower requirement for the pumps does not change. The reduced capacity of the pumps may require slightly longer pump run time, but the effects are not substantial and should not affect the utility’s ability to effectively treat and deliver water. 8.1.5. PERMITTING The City of Virginia has secured a water appropriation permit (MnDNR Permit #1984-2037) to withdraw water from the Rouchleau Pit at a rate not to exceed 4,000 gpm. The permit stipulates a maximum annual withdrawal of 1 billion gallons, combined from two intakes. The temporary lowering of the pit water level for construction dewatering should not affect the City’s appropriation permit. 8.1.6. ASSESSMENTOFEFFECTONCITYOFVIRGINIAWATERSUPPLY The overall effects of dewatering the Rouchleau Pit on the Virginia water supply system are minimal. In terms of water quality, there is no indication that changes in the water treatment will be necessary during the dewatering activities. The existing treatment plant has excess capacity which allows operational flexibility and the ability to adjust process controls and flow rates. Lowering the pit level will alter the raw water pumping conditions, but the effects on pump operation and energy use are not substantial, especially given the short-term nature of the impacts. 8.2. ARCELORMITTAL 8.2.1. DESCRIPTIONOFWATERSUPPLYSYSTEM ArcelorMittal operates a water intake barge located in the northeast corner of the Rouchleau Pit. This barge houses one submersible pump which conveys water through a 16inch diameter steel/plastic pipeline that runs north from the pit up the ridge to Sauntry Creek. Since its installation in 2008, the barge in the Rouchleau Pit has operated at water elevations between 1,301feet and1,310feet. 19 NTS, 2013 TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  p. 30  At Sauntry Creek a diversion structure and valve configuration splits the flow. During regular operations, the flow is directed to the Enterprise Pit to supplement the water storage in that pit for use at the Minorca plant. Flow can also be directed into Sauntry Creek to deliver water to the City of Virginia for the maintenance of Bailey Lake and Silver Lake. The pumping systems and access roads to the facilities are located on land leased from RGGS Corporation. ArcelorMittal operates a barge-mounted pumping system in Enterprise Pit which pumps water from the Enterprise Pit to its Minorca Mine taconite plant for potable and process-related uses, approximately 1.7 miles northeast of the pit. The water intake barge houses three submersible pumps and is stationed in the northwest corner of the Enterprise Pit. Water is pumped from the Enterprise Pit through a 16-inch diameter steel pipeline that runs to the Minorca plant. Since 2008, the barge has operated at water elevations between 1,305 feet and 1,314 feet. 8.2.2. OPERATIONS Lowering the water level in the Rouchleau Pit would affect the operation of ArcelorMittal’s water intake barge. Based on lake bathymetry20 and the configuration of the barge system, a 30-foot drop in water level would render ArcelorMittal’s Rouchleau Pit pumping system inoperable. (See Figure 8 showing the Rouchleau Pit at proposed elevation of 1,275 feet.) This would limit ArcelorMittal’s ability to control the water level in the Enterprise Pit and potentially disrupt flow to the Sauntry Creek system that is periodically supplemented with Rouchleau Pit water to feed the City lakes. However, this effect can be mitigated, as discussed in Section 8.2.4 below. 8.2.3. PERMITTING In 1973, the operator of the Minorca Mine secured a water appropriation permit (MnDNR Permit #1973-5095) to pump water from the Enterprise Pit. The permit is now in ArcelorMittal’s name, and includes a maximum annual allowance of 2.476 billion gallons, with no imposed limit on pumping rate. ArcelorMittal uses the water for potable and process supply at the Minorca taconite plant. In 2008, ArcelorMittal secured a water appropriation permit to pump water from the Rouchleau Pit (MnDNR Permit #2008-0216). Water from the Rouchleau Pit is pumped to maintain the water level in the Enterprise Pit. Water can also be diverted to the City of Virginia through a diversion system to assist with the maintenance of Bailey Lake and Silver Lake as discussed above. Permit #2008-0216 stipulates a maximum annual withdrawal of 903.9 million gallons from the Rouchleau Pit, a maximum pumping rate of 2,000 gpm, and a minimum water elevation of 1,280 feet has been incorporated into the permit to protect the City’s water supply. 8.2.4. ASSESSMENTOFEFFECTONARCELORMITTALWATERSUPPLY Dewatering the Rouchleau Pit by 30 feet would have a substantial impact on the ArcelorMittal mine water supply system, primarily in terms of available water quantity. A 20 MnDOT, 2013 TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  p. 31  30-foot drop in water level would render the existing ArcelorMittal pumping system in the Rouchleau Pit inoperable. Once the water level falls below 1,280 feet, ArcelorMittal is no longer permitted to pump from the Rouchleau Pit. The ramifications of this are the inability to maintain the water level in the Enterprise Pit and deliver water to the City of Virginia lakes via Sauntry Creek. If the water level in the Enterprise Pit drops below approximately 1,305 feet, the water intake barge would needto be moved and/or reconfigured. As noted in Section 6, the effects on ArcelorMittal’s water supply could be minimized/mitigated by using the dewatering system to maintain the water level in the Enterprise Pit. ArcelorMittal’s barge in the Rouchleau Pit would be allowed to go dry during construction in this scenario. Water from dewatering could also be routed to Sauntry Creek to maintain the ability to augment Bailey and Silver Lakes in the City of Virginia. Without the mitigation measures described in Section 6, the ArcelorMittal mine would need to submit an amendment to their appropriation permit requesting an allowance to continue pumping below the specified elevation of 1,280 feet during the temporary construction period. ArcelorMittal may also need to negotiate its lease with RGGS Corporation allowing for relocation of the pumping system and access to the site. 9. CONCLUSIONS This study explored requirements and considerations associated with dewatering the Rouchleau Pit to allow dry construction of the TH 53 Alternative E-1A – RSS Option. The study included an investigation of the effects of temporary dewatering on local systems, identified water bodies that could potentially receive the transfer from Rouchleau Pit, and provided concept-level design and costinformation for atemporary dewatering system. The majority of the potential receiving waters assessed in this study were not carried forward for further study as a result of the short schedule for construction associated with the Alternative E-1A – RSS Option, which factored into the allowance of a 3-month period for the initial drawdown. The relatively compressed schedule for the initial drawdown resulted in a high discharge rate, which limited the receiving water options. Three options were identified that could potentially receive the water transfer from the Rouchleau Pit. These include the West Two River Reservoir and the Minntac Tailings Basin Cell 2 as options to receive the dewatering transfer during the initial drawdown period, and the Enterprise Pit/Sauntry Creek system as the best option to receive water from the Rouchleau Pit during the maintenance dewatering period. Costs associated with these options were estimated to range from $15.2 million to $23.1 million. Temporary dewatering of the Rouchleau Pit is not projected to have a substantial effect on the City of Virginia’s water supply. The raw water intake is sufficiently deep within the Rouchleau Pit andthe water treatment process used by Virginia Public Utilities is capable of handling small fluctuations in raw water quality that may be encountered during construction. The major impact of the temporary dewatering will be on the existing Rouchleau Pit pumping system used by ArcelorMittal. A 30 foot drop in the water level will render the existing system inoperable. However, the concept developed for the maintenance dewatering system will mitigate the effects on this water user. TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  p. 32  REFERENCESANDRESOURCES City of Virginia, Consumer Confidence Report, 2012 Drinking Water Report, PWSID 1690046, (Virginia, Minnesota), 2012 Harbaugh, A.W., Banta, E.R., Hill, M.C., and McDonald, M.G., 2000, MODFLOW-2000, the U.S. Geological Survey modular ground-water model --User guide to modularization concepts and the Ground-Water Flow Process: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 00-92, 121 p. HDR Engineering, Inc.

The Biwabik Formation is comprised of layers of cherty and slaty members, with cherty members containing iron oxides and slaty members containing iron silicates and iron carbonates, and has been intensely folded near the pit. The Biwabik Formation is unconfined at mine pits and where the unit subcrops under thin glacial deposits, and is confined where overlain by the Virginia Argillite southwest of the Rouchleau Pit.

Therefore, the groundwater elevations set at the boundaries were estimatedfromthatdataandsettomaintainasouthwestflowdirectionwithgroundwater levelsneartheminepitrangingfrom1,380to1,400feet.Theelevationdatausedforthe boundaries is based on a review of all the available information and represents best professionaljudgment Alinearconstantheadboundarywasplacedinthenorthernpartofthemodelgridinitially setatelevationsrangingfrom1,400to1,450andcalibratedtoanelevationof1,400feet.At thesouthernedgeofthemodelaconstantheadboundarywassetinitiallyatanelevationof 1,350to1,400feetandcalibratedtoanelevationof1,350feet. RouchleauPitDrainBoundary The Rouchleau Pit is modeled as a drain to simulate groundwater inflow from current pumpingandfuturedewatering.Thedrainwassetatthecurrentstaticwaterlevelelevation inthepit(1,305feet)maintainedbypumping. AquiferRecharge Two recharge zones are defined in the model.

A storage coefficient (S) of 1 X10-5 was assigned to the single model layer based on the aquifer-specific hydraulic properties summarizedinprevioussectionsofthisreport. 6.2STEADY-STATECALIBRATION Themodelwasfirstrunfortime-staticconditionsusingtheboundaryandaquiferpropertyinputs described above.

Not including those dewatering rates from other nearby mines in the model causes an overpredictionofthegroundwaterlevelandinflowtotheRouchleauPit.Itwasbeyondthescopeofthis modeltoincludethoseothermine pitdewateringsystemsinthemodeldomain.Bynotincluding theothernearbypitdewatering,themodelisconservativelyover-estimatingtheestimatedinflow tothepitatboththecurrentandfuturewaterelevation. 7.0ESTIMATEDGROUNDWATERINFLOWTOPITDURINGDEWATERING Thegroundwaterinflowtothepitduringdewateringtoelevation1,275feetwasestimatedusinga transient simulation setting the pit drain boundary elevation to 1,275 feet. Simulated hydraulic head data from the calibrated steady-state simulation were used as starting head inputs for the transientsimulationforthefollowingstressperiods:1month,2months,6months,1year,5years, 10years,50years,and100years.Thecomputedsteady-statedraininflowratewassubtractedfrom the computed transient drain inflow rate to calculate the additional estimated drain inflow.

In reality, it will take approximately three months for the dewatering system to reduce the water level in the pit to 1,275 feet and the additional inflow will actually be less than 3,400 gpm. However, for the purposes of engineering designitcanbeassumedthatthedewateringsystemwillneedtoaccommodateupto3,400gpmof groundwaterinflow(inadditionrequirementsforinitialdrawdownofthewatervolume).Simulated groundwater levels are shown on Figure 11 and indicate that the effects of dewatering will be limited to the immediate area around the pit and localized groundwater elevations will decrease approximately10to20feetinthevicinityoftheCityofVirginia. TH53 Relocation Alternative E-1A – RSS Option  Water Management Study  September 2014  S.P.6918-80 (TH 53)  Page 9  Table3 SimulatedGroundwater Inflow toPit DuringDewateringAbove CurrentInflowRates ElapsedTimeFrom Startof Dewatering  Additional Groundwater Inflow Resulting FromDewatering From 1,305 to 1,275 FtMSL (gpm)  1month  3,407  2months  2,623  6months  2,117  12months  2,062  5years  2,059  10years  2,059  50years  2,059  100years  2,059  Note: Tableshowsadditionalgroundwaterinflowsimulatedtooccurfromloweringpitwaterlevelfrom 1,305to1,275feetelevation.Thisisinadditiontothepumpingalreadyoccurring. 8.0SUMMARY TheAlternativeE-1A–RSSOptionfortherelocationofTH-53wouldrequiredecreasingthewater levelinthepitfromelevation1,305feet(asmeasuredin2013)toelevation1,275feettoallowdry constructionoftheembankmentbythereinforcedsoilslopeconstructionmethod.Thiswillcause an increase in groundwater inflow to the pit and adepression of regional groundwater levels.

Historically, starting in the 1950s, MnDOT constructed roadways in northern Minnesota using taconite tailings for aggregate in road base and bituminous. No records were kept documenting the origin of the taconite. Many of these roadways now require reconstruction which requires excavation of taconite tailings. Taconite Geology As described by Jirsa et a!. (2008), the Biwabik Iron Formation is a layered sequence of iron-rich sedimentary rocks that was metamorphosed by intrusions of the Duluth Complex. The metamorphic recrystallization of iron-formation locally produced iron-rich amphiboles and other fibrous iron-silicate minerals. McSwiggen eta!. (2008) state that most of the Biwabik Iron Formation has not been metamorphosed to any extent but the emplacement of the Duluth Complex resulted in metamorphism of a 2-3 mile-wide band (metamorphic aureole) of the formation on the east end of the mining range. The east range contains a significant number of metamorphic silicates such as the gruneritecummingtonite series which has minerals that generally resemble some asbestos-like minerals. Because the minerals associated with the Biwabik Iron Formation are complex, it cannot be assumed that the mineralogy of one mine or part of the range will correlate with other mines or parts of the range. Iron ore was discovered in Minnesota in 1865, and when, by 1940, the high-grade natural ore had been removed, a process was developed to mine the low-grade 'taconite" rock Page 96 of 1 08 MnDOT Regulated Materials Management Section 11 that surrounded the enriched ore deposits. The process produced iron-rich taconite pellets and unwanted waste rock-taconite tailings (Berndt et al. 2008). Taconite Studies Zanko et al. (2008) examined 18 samples of coarse taconite tailings (which generally meet the construction industry definition of fine aggregate, rock that is less than 3/8 inch) from five western taconite operations for mineralogy using X-ray diffraction, polarized light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and two Environmental Protection Agency methods. They concluded that no regulated asbestos minerals or amphibole minerals were detected in western Biwabik Iron Formation samples A small number of non-asbestos and non-amphibole mineral cleavage fragments/mineral fibers were detected by scanning electron microscopy (26 out of I 000 fields sampled). One sample of eastern Biwabik Iron Formation detected the presence of amphibole, which when pulverized to -200 mesh, can produce a larger number of cleavage fragments/mineral fibers than comparably pulverized western range taconite. Zanko eta!. (2008) stated that" ... the Superfund Method for the Determination of Releasable Asbestos in Soils and Bulk Materials (United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), 1997) as modified by Berman and Kolk (2000) failed to generate any protocol fibers, i.e., fibers longer than 5 urn and thinner that 0.5 urn, from either the western coarse tailings samples or the single eastern Biwabik Iron Formation sample. The combined findings suggest coarse tailings and other taconite mining byproducts should be treated with the same common sense safety and industrial hygiene approach practiced for all mineral-based materials that have the potential to generate respirable dust." In 2009 MnDOT collected samples of taconite-containing aggregate road base and bituminous in a portion of TH 61 where old road plans indicated taconite was used for construction. MnDOT completed analysis of the samples using the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, (NESHAP)-required method of Polarized Light Microscopy (PLM) to determine the presence of asbestos. Taconite with no detection of fibers using the PLM method would not be regulated by NESHAP. Because of the potential presence of eastern range amphibole minerals in the taconite, MnDOT also completed Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analyses of the samples. The results of the analyses showed no detection of fibers from either method in bituminous samples. Aggregate base samples also showed no detection of fibers using PLM analysis. However, the minerals Curnrningtonite-Grunerite and Actinolite were detected in some samples by the TEM method (MnDOT, 2009). Conclusions Sample testing conducted by MnDOT and others indicates that taconite tailings are not subject to asbestos regulations. MnDOT has produced this best practice for management of tailings used in highway construction, recognizing that even though taconite tailings are not subject to regulation, some reasonable handling techniques are prudent because a fraction of the minerals found in taconite have an asbestos-like form. This best practice is based on MnDOT sampling and on studies conducted by others which are cited in this document. Page 97 of 1 08 MnDOT Regulated Materials Management Section 11 Best Management Practice of Roadway Taconite Tailings 1. Future MnDOT highway construction contract special provisions will inform potential bidders of the presence of taconite tailings in road sections where MnDOT knows or suspects the material was historically used to construct the roadway. 2. The MnDOT District Safety Office in the district where a highway project with suspect or known taconite tailings is located will provide awareness training for all MnDOT project personnel regarding proper safety and industrial hygiene practices to follow when working with mineral-based materials such as taconite tailings. 3. Safety and industrial hygiene practices, such as wetting active work areas, will be used when handling taconite tailings, to minimize the generation of respirable dust. 4. Temporary stockpiles of taconite tailings will be covered with minimum 10 mil reinforced plastic or wetted to minimize generation of respirable dust. 5. All taconite tailings excavated for the project will be re-used on the project as part of road base, fill areas (such as berms) or fill slopes. All taconite tailings re-used on a project will be covered with either pavement or minimum of six inches of soil. References Berman, D.W., Kolk, A.J., 2000.

Arseneau, P.E., PTOE Deputy Commissioner/Chief Engineer Subject:  Roadway Incident Procedure Vehicle Fluid and Cargo Spill Response Expiration This new Technical Memorandum replaces Maintenance Bulletin 97-1 and Mn/DOT Policy Guideline, Multimodal No. 89-1-G-1 and shall remain in effect until April 20, 2016 unless superseded prior to that date or incorporated into the Mn/DOT Maintenance Manual. Implementation The guidelines in the Technical Memo shall be used immediately. Introduction Mn/DOT personnel frequently respond to incidences where motor vehicle fluid and/or cargo spills have occurred.  At these scenes, vehicle fluids and fuels such as antifreeze, gasoline and/or diesel fuel may be found on the roadway or its shoulder.  Ignition of vehicle fuels could prevent rescue and cause severe burns or fatalities.  Roadway lanes remain closed until vehicle fluid spills are remediated, impeding the flow of traffic.  Unrecovered spills will contaminate Mn/DOT right of way. This procedure provides guidance for responding quickly to vehicle fluid spills and loss of cargo in order to protect motorist safety, minimize impacts to the environment, ensure proper cleanup and open the roadway to travel.  This procedure should be used in conjunction with the State of Minnesota “Open Roads Policy” which is an agreement between the Minnesota State Patrol and Mn/DOT for quick clearance of the state highway system and the Minnesota “Quick Clearance Statute” found in Minn.Stat.§169.041, Subd. 5a. Mn/DOT personnel may discover abandoned containers on roadway right of way where no motor vehicle incident has occurred.  Proper management of abandoned containers is described in Mn/DOT Technical Memorandum No. 10-08-ENV-02. Mn/DOT response to spills and abandoned containers may differ from procedures described in this document when the incident occurs on state highways located within tribal reservation boundaries.  Consult with the Mn/DOT Office of Environmental Services to determine proper, current procedures for responding to incidents within tribal reservations.       Purpose The intent of this procedure is to provide guidance for Mn/DOT employees responding to roadway incidents on how to properly and safely handle materials in order to open roadways for traffic.  This procedure should be applied to spills at traffic incidents where there is an indentified responsible party(ies) who will be responsible for all costs associated with the incident or spills.  This procedure may also be applied to spills where no responsible party can be identified, likely resulting in Mn/DOT absorbing the cost of cleanup unless another funding source can be identified. Appropriate spill response actions are determined by considering factors such as the spill location, weather conditions and volume and composition of the spilled substance.  This procedure establishes communication protocol necessary to make response action determinations.   -MORETechnical Memorandum No. 11-10-M-02 Roadway Incident Procedure April 20, 2011 Page 2 Guidelines General Requirements Emergency response contractors will complete removal of hazardous materials and any other materials that have been determined not safe for Mn/DOT personnel to handle.  Emergency response contractors may be brought to the scene by Mn/DOT personnel, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency on-call person (MPCA), Minnesota Department of Agriculture on-call person (MDA), other incident responders or a party responsible for the incident (see Retaining an Emergency Response Contractor).  Mn/DOT personnel may handle the following materials to open the roadway to traffic: • motor vehicle fluids, which include gasoline, diesel fuel, hydraulic fluid, transmission fluid, engine oil and coolant. • intact cargo containers that do not contain hazardous or otherwise dangerous materials. • ruptured containers or packages and associated released contents that are not hazardous and determined not to be dangerous because of the material content or volume released. Mn/DOT shall not handle any of the following items under any circumstance: • intact or ruptured cargo containers or packages of hazardous materials or materials determined to be dangerous. • Mn/DOT personnel shall not perform removal or cleanup of released material along the roadway that is not obstructing travel.  Cleanup of this material will be completed by a contractor (see Retaining an Emergency Response Contractor).  Mn/DOT personnel should monitor the cleanup operation to ensure that department requirements are met (see Cleanup off the Traveled Portion of Roadway).  Spilled fluids recovered with sorbent and cargo removed from the traveled roadway will be stored in the right of way in the proximity of the incident and not brought back to any Mn/DOT facility, except under extreme circumstances (see Roadway Clearance).  A contractor will remove and manage final disposition of the waste material (see Retaining an Emergency Response Contractor). Mn/DOT Personnel Requirements Training • Mn/DOT employees responding to incidents covered by this policy must receive Mn/DOT’s annual Right-To-Know training that includes instruction in how to manage spilled vehicle fluids and recognize hazardous or dangerous materials.  Safety • Personnel will use required personal protective equipment • Safe work practices will be followed during assessment of the incident scene and application of containment materials. • Proper personal hygiene practices and decontamination procedures will be followed after exposure to spilled substances.  Response Procedure Arriving at the Incident When Mn/DOT is the first to arrive at a vehicle incident, the employee will evaluate the situation, notify the Dispatcher or other personnel designated by the district office and request the following as needed: • State Patrol, local police or other emergency services personnel  • Subarea Supervisor • Additional traffic control • District Safety Administrator • Trained Mn/DOT personnel, if not already on site, for containment of vehicle fluid spills and cargo removal (see Roadway Clearance) -MORETechnical Memorandum No. 11-10-M-02 Roadway Incident Procedure April 20, 2011 Page 3 If the evaluation determines that hazardous materials are present at the scene or the situation is dangerous because of the material content or volume released, an emergency response contractor must perform all operations to open the travel lanes: • The emergency response contractor will be retained by Mn/DOT, MPCA, MDA, another incident responder or the responsible party to assume complete control and cleanup responsibilities (see Retaining an Emergency Response Contractor).  Mn/DOT personnel are then relieved of all work involving cleanup of the spilled materials in the travel lanes.   • Mn/DOT personnel should continue to monitor the incident response and provide traffic control until the incident response is complete.   When Mn/DOT is called to a motor vehicle accident scene: • Determine the appropriate amount of sorbent or containment products that are needed for containment of fluid spills (see Roadway Clearance). Roadway Clearance The following procedure should be followed when Mn/DOT personnel complete actions to open the roadway or until such time when Mn/DOT is relieved by an emergency response contractor:   Fluid Spills • If needed deploy necessary traffic control • Ensure that the appropriate Maintenance subarea supervisor has been notified • Inform Dispatch or other personnel designated by the district office of identity of responsible party or parties for the accident.  • Ensure that the Duty Officer has been notified at 1-800-422-0798 or 651-649-5451 in the Twin Cities Metro Area. • If there is a motor vehicle fluid spill, assess the spill to determine the types and amount of fluid spilled and determine safety precautions needed. o Determine a safe working distance in relation to motor vehicle fluid type, quantity of the spill and presence of nearby sources of ignition. o Use appropriate type and amount of sorbent and containment products to safely and effectively absorb and contain spilled vehicle fluids • Only trained personnel shall contain vehicle fluid spills and move nonhazardous cargo containers (see Mn/DOT Personnel Requirements). • The contained fluids or contaminated sorbent materials shall be removed from the traveled portion of the roadway and relocated to a safe location on site for pickup by responsible party or their agent.   • The contaminated materials shall be protected from the elements and marked with traffic cones. • Contaminated material, including soil, sand and sorbents must not be thinspread anywhere on the highway right of way or brought to any Mn/DOT facility/site for storage.  Possible exceptions to bringing contaminated material to a Mn/DOT facility for storage prior to disposal are: o extreme weather conditions that prevent storing at the incident scene or o incidents in urban areas where nearby storage space is not available. • Monitor the situation and apply additional sorbent and/or containment products as necessary.  • If not picked up in a timely manner, the contaminated materials shall be protected from the elements and if necessary, marked with traffic cones.  Cargo • If cargo has been released from a vehicle(s), take appropriate action as follows: o Do not handle cargo that contains hazardous or dangerous material.  Notify the dispatcher or other personnel designated by the district office that an emergency response contractor is needed to handle the cargo. o Ensure that the Duty Officer has been notified of any release of hazardous -MORETechnical Memorandum No. 11-10-M-02 Roadway Incident Procedure April 20, 2011 Page 4 material cargo at 1-800-422-0798 or 651-649-5451 in the Twin Cities Metro Area. • Remove the following cargo from the traveled portion of the roadway (per Open Roads policy) and relocate to a safe location near the incident scene for pickup by responsible party or their agent: o Intact cargo that does not contain hazardous or dangerous material. o Ruptured containers and associated contents that are not hazardous or otherwise dangerous. Retaining an Emergency Response Contractor An emergency response contractor shall be retained to complete removal of hazardous materials and any other materials that have been determined not safe for Mn/DOT personnel to handle.  Emergency response contractors may be brought to the scene by Mn/DOT personnel, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency on-call person (MPCA), Minnesota Department of Agriculture on-call person (MDA), other incident responders or a party responsible for the incident.  In general, the MPCA will retain a contractor to respond to large petroleum spills and any spills or cargo involving hazardous materials.  The following steps should be taken to determine who will retain the emergency response contractor: • Provide the state duty officer with contact information of a Mn/DOT person at the scene who can help coordinate the contractor response. • The Mn/DOT contact person should request that the state duty officer connect him/her with the MPCA on-call person in order to determine who will mobilize the contractor or other emergency response team.  Cost Reimbursement Mn/DOT’s costs incurred for cleanup, disposal, repair and all associated costs in responding to the incident will be compiled by the maintenance area involved and billed to the responsible party or the responsible party’s insurance carrier.  Record the following information to enable Mn/DOT’s effort to recover incident response costs: • The State Patrol event number and yellow tag number if issued. • The company name and US DOT number of any commercial vehicle operators involved in the incident.   Cleanup off the Traveled Portion of Roadway Any contaminated soil and/or surface water on highway right of way must be cleaned up in accordance with Mn/DOT Office of Environmental Services procedure (available from OES or District Permits Office).  If right of way cleanup cannot be completed at the time of the incident, a permit must be obtained from the local Mn/DOT Permit’s Office prior to initiating work.  Utility clearance through Gopher State One Call must be completed before any excavation of contaminated soil can take place.  Cost to complete the cleanup and dispose of the contaminated soil should be at the expense of the responsible party or parties. Questions For information on the technical contents of this memorandum, please contact Brian Kamnikar at (651) 366-3617. Any questions regarding publication of this Technical Memorandum should be referred to the Design Standards unit, DesignStandards.DOT@state.mn.us.

The objective of this report is to evaluate the potential water resource impacts caused by each project alternative. This report identifies:  Potential waterbody impacts (Rouchleau Pit and area streams)  Potential wetland impacts of the project and potential mitigation options Project Background Since May 1960, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) has operated a segment of US 53 on an easement granted by United States Steel Corporation (now RGGS Land and Minerals Co.). This roughly one-mile segment of US 53, from approximately 2nd Avenue West to Vermillion Drive in Virginia, is subject to iron ore mining rights held by RGGS and Cliffs Natural Resources (United Taconite Division)—the mine’s owner and operator, respectively. Under the 1960 easement terms, MnDOT agreed to relocate US 53 upon notice from the mine owner/operator. On May 5, 2010, United Taconite (UTAC)1 provided notice to MnDOT that the 1960 easement rights would be terminated. MnDOT has negotiated with RGGS a May 2017 date as the deadline for vacating the highway, after which time RGGS and UTAC may proceed with mining activity into the area currently occupied by US 53. Project Alternatives The final Scoping Decision Document (SDD), distributed in September 2012, provided a summary of the Scoping process findings and documented the proposed scope and focus of the EIS. Four alternatives were proposed for detailed study in the Draft EIS: No Build, Existing US 53, M-1, and E-2 Alternatives.  An Amended Scoping Decision Document (ASDD) was completed in September 2013, adding one additional alternative to be studied in the Draft EIS, Alternative E-1A (Figure 1). Some Scoping alternative alignments that had been dismissed from further consideration in the Draft EIS during the 2012 Scoping process (specifically Alternative W-1) were reconsidered with minor alignment modifications (W-1A). The W-1A alignment was dropped from further consideration, in part due to resource impacts. The W-1A wetland impacts are documented in this report, in addition to the alternatives to be evaluated in the Draft EIS (Figure 2).  No Build Alternative – Closure of the Easement Segment of US 53 The No Build Alternative would respond to the easement terms by closing the easement segment of US 53, resulting in traffic being rerouted to existing highways. Signage would be used to officially mark the rerouting of US 53, which would follow existing roadways to the west of US 53: MN 37, Saint Louis County Road 7 (Co. 7), and US 169. This alternative provides a basis for comparison with other alternatives, and proposes no physical changes to the corridor other than vacating the easement. 1 United Taconite (UTAC) is a division of Cliffs Natural Resources, Inc. UTAC operates the mine on behalf of the land and mineral owner, RGGS Land and Minerals Co. For brevity, most references in this document will refer simply to “UTAC.” WATER RESOURCES TECHNICAL REPORT NOVEMBER 2013 US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT Existing US 53 Alternative The Existing US 53 Alternative, though not in compliance with the terms of the existing easement, would keep US 53 in place and open to traffic by addressing the economic, legal, or engineering issues associated with resolving the terms of the easement agreement. The State of Minnesota would not vacate US 53 but would keep the highway open. If an agreement could be reached, this alternative assumed incorporating construction of grade separations or other highway modifications to allow for reduced right-of-way area and accommodate mine operations on both sides of US 53. Alternative M-1 This alternative would mostly follow the grade created by the now backfilled Auburn Pit through the UTAC mine. As shown in Figure 1, Alternative M-1 would cross a mine operations area that will be active for many years. This alternative would involve construction of up to two miles of new highway, terminating west of 2nd Avenue, with earthwork and structures required for continued mine operations on both sides of the new alignment. Local roads at each end of the alternative would also be reconstructed to maintain community access. Alternative E-1A From south to north, this alternative diverges from existing US 53 just north of Cuyuna Drive. The alignment crosses MN 135 between the existing interchanges of US 53 and Bourgin Road. The new alignment then continues parallel to Bourgin Road before turning to the northwest to cross the Rouchleau Pit along an existing submerged haul road embankment. After crossing the pit, the alignment turns to the southwest to reconnect with existing US 53 beyond 2nd Avenue (see Figure 1). Alternative E-2 This alternative extends US 53 north of its existing location in order to cross the Rouchleau Pit at one of the pit’s narrow openings (see Figure 1). Access at 2nd Avenue and MN 135 would be maintained in approximately the same locations. This alternative is located outside of the UTAC permit to mine area. Alternative W-1A (not to be studied in Draft EIS) This alternative follows existing highways MN 37 and Co. 7. These routes are both existing two-lane highways, which could provide a portion of the right of way needed to develop a four-lane highway. The modified alternative completely avoids areas with mining rights.  Regulatory Context/MethodologyRegulatory Context The following agencies are responsible for regulation, review, and/or permitting of surface water related issues within the study area resulting from construction of the project:  United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), under the purview of the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)  Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA)  Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT), under the purview of the Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR)  Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MnDNR) WATER RESOURCES TECHNICAL REPORT NOVEMBER 2013 US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT United States Army Corps of Engineers Navigable waters are regulated under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act (RHA) of 1899 and Section 404 of the CWA. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) established a program to regulate the discharge of dredged or fill material into Waters of the United States, including those wetlands that are not isolated hydrologically on the landscape. Section 404 of the CWA is implemented by the USACE under the purview of the USEPA. Section 404 of the CWA requires a permit to be issued by the USACE prior to the placement of any dredged or fill material into any Waters of the United States, including wetlands. The USACE is responsible for administering the day-to-day of the Section 404 permitting program (including individual and general permit decisions), conducting Final or Preliminary Jurisdictional Determinations, developing policy and guidance, and enforcing all other Section 404 provisions. Minnesota Pollution Control Agency The MPCA establishes state water quality standards and conducts periodic water quality and biological monitoring. Water quality standards are implemented primarily through National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits issued to dischargers (MN 115; MN Rule Chapters 7001, 7090). Section 401 of the CWA requires the affected state to issue a water quality certification, or a waiver, for each Section 404 permit. The MPCA reviews USACE permits and is responsible for issuing Section 401 water quality certification (MN 115; MN Rule Chapter 7001). Minnesota Department of Transportation The Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act (WCA) of 1991, under the purview of the Minnesota Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR), establishes the goal of no net loss of wetlands (MN Rule Chapter 8420). MnDOT acts as the local government unit (LGU), for its projects, in coordination with the local agencies, which in this case includes Saint Louis County Planning and Community Development and the North Saint Louis Soil and Water Conservation District. The WCA requires that anyone proposing to drain or fill a wetland must try to avoid disturbing the wetland. If avoidance cannot be achieved, the WCA requires that impacts be minimized to the extent possible. Wetland replacement must replace the public value of wetlands lost as a result of an impact. Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Wetlands are regulated by the DNR if they are identified as public waters or public waters wetlands. Public waters/wetlands are all water basins and water courses that meet the criteria set forth in Minn. Stat., Section 103G.005, subd. 15, and that are identified on Public Water Inventory (PWI) maps (Minn. Stat., Section 103G.201). Proposed impacts involving a change in the course, current, or cross section of public waters/wetlands would require a permit from the DNR (MN Rule Chapter 6115). This same rule chapter requires an appropriation permit from the DNR for groundwater or surface water pumping. On behalf of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the DNR in conjunction with the local government units (cities, watersheds) also manages activities that may impact floodplains associated with DNR waters/wetlands, including activities such as construction, excavation, or deposition of materials over or under waters which may affect flood stage, floodplain, or floodway boundaries. Methodology Study Area The study area for water resources included land adjacent to the project alternatives to be studied in the Draft EIS, generally extending out 500 feet or more. The estimated construction limits were defined WATER RESOURCES TECHNICAL REPORT NOVEMBER 2013 US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT for each alternative, and they are reflected in Figure 1. For the Build Alternatives, the estimated construction limits consist of the existing right-of-way in some areas and a varying corridor throughout the rest of the alignments. For the Existing US 53 and No Build Alternatives, the existing right-of-way was generally used as the construction limits. For Alternative W-1A, the estimated construction limits consisted of an approximately 200-foot wide corridor throughout the alignment (Figure 2). Inventory Methods The water resources were identified based on current digital data and a field review. Surface waters and streams were identified from the DNR PWI. Wetlands were identified based on current digital data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) National Wetlands Inventory (NWI), web soil data for hydric soils (http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/), and field review of wetland areas to verify photo signatures of plant communities (USDOI, 2012; USFWS 1974-1988; DNR, 1983). Wetland boundaries were verified by a field review of wetland areas for general wetland types and characteristics, conducted on June 2021, 2012, by photointerpretation, and by review of digital data. It is assumed that all identified wetland areas, including those that may have been disturbed or created as a result of prior mining or grading activities, would be regulated if impacted. Each wetland identified was given a unique identification number and the total basin size was estimated. During the field review, approximately 90 percent of the wetland areas were reviewed to determine the dominant plant community/wetland type and extent of the wetland boundaries, excluding Alternative W-1A. The field reviewed wetlands were then used as a baseline for photo interpretation to confirm wetland boundaries and types for wetland where access was more difficult due to terrain or heavy cover. For Alternative W-1A and inaccessible areas, topographic data from the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office (two foot contours) was used to estimate wetland boundaries. Wetlands were also categorized into one of five plant communities as described by Eggers and Reed, including Shallow Marsh (SM), Wet Meadow (WM), Sedge Meadow (SME), Shrub-Carr (SC), and Seasonally Flooded Basin (SF).2 Many of the identified wetlands have multiple plant communities. The different plant communities represented within the project area include:  Shallow Marsh plant communities have soils that are saturated or inundated by standing water up to six inches in depth throughout most of the growing season. Herbaceous emergent vegetation such as cattails, bulrushes, arrowheads, and sedges characterize this community.  Wet Meadow plant communities are dominated by grasses and by forbs such as giant goldenrod, growing on saturated soils. The forbs and grasses of these meadows tend to be less competitive, more nutrient demanding, and often shorter-lived species than the sedges of the sedge meadow community. Therefore, Wet Meadows may represent younger communities that indicate recent disturbances.  Sedge Meadow plant communities are dominated by the sedges growing on saturated soils. Dominant vegetation includes sedges, spike-rushes, bulrushes, and nut-grasses. Grasses, especially Canada bluejoint grass, and true rushes may also be present. The forb species are diverse but scattered and may flower poorly under intense competition with the sedges. 2 Plant Community descriptions can be found in the USACE’s “Wetland Plants and Plant Communities of Minnesota and Wisconsin” (Eggers and Reed, 1997). WATER RESOURCES TECHNICAL REPORT NOVEMBER 2013 US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT  Shrub-Carr communities are plant communities composed of tall, deciduous shrubs growing on saturated to seasonally flooded soils. They are usually dominated by willows and dogwoods. The ground layer typically includes some of the ferns, sedges, grasses, and forbs of sedge meadow and wet meadow communities.  Seasonally Flooded Basins are poorly drained, shallow depressions that may have standing water for a few weeks each year but are usually dry for much of the growing season. These basins may be kettles in glacial deposits, low spots in outwash plains, or depressions in floodplains. Typical species include smartweeds, beggarticks, grasses, and nut-grasses. One unique aspect of seasonally flooded basins is that the alternating periods of flood and drought can eliminate perennial plants so that annual plant species typically dominate the community. These basins can have a forested component with a dominance of willow, ash, and other softwood trees. Quality Assessment Method Each wetland was also assigned a value rating of exceptional, high quality, medium quality, or low quality, based on a qualitative assessment of diversity and integrity of the plant community using the USACE’s Wetland Plants and Plant Communities of Minnesota and Wisconsin (Eggers and Reed, 1997). These ratings include: Exceptional: Plant community is undisturbed or sufficiently recovered from past disturbances such that it represents pre-European settlement conditions. Non-native plant species are absent or, if present, constitute a minor percent cover of that community. Unique features such as an old growth forest, never-plowed wet prairie, or threatened and endangered species may also be present. High Quality: The plant community has a high diversity of native species with non-native and/or invasive species comprising less than 20 percent cover. Medium Quality: The plant community has less diversity than the high quality, but the nonnative/invasive species make up 20-50 percent of the total cover. Low Quality: The plant community is comprised of only a few dominant species with more than 50 percent of the dominant species being non-native or invasive species. Many of the areas identified as wetland have been disturbed or created as a result of prior grading/mining activities in the area. Over time, areas that are not provided positive drainage (ruts, old road/railroad beds, depressions) and have dense clayey soils hold water long enough to support wetland vegetation.  At this time, jurisdiction of the wetland areas has not been determined; rather, it has been assumed that all identified wetland areas would be regulated if impacted. Any areas that were considered to be natural/undisturbed wetlands are noted in Table 1, based on 1948-1989 aerial photos (Figure 2 and Appendix B) and field observation of past disturbance (overburden, tailings). WATER RESOURCES TECHNICAL REPORT NOVEMBER 2013 US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT Impact Analysis Methods Water resources were evaluated for potential impacts based on a worst case assumption that everything within the construction limits would be impacted by the project. This approach allows for potential worst case impacts to be evaluated and expect that the impacts may be reduced as the project layout is refined. Affected Environment Inventory Results Waterbodies: The only named surface water in the area of the Build Alternatives is the waterbody that has developed in the combined Mesabi Mountain Mine and Rouchleau Pits. Due to the rising water levels within the pit since mining ceased, the Mesabi Mountain Mine Pit (north end) and Rouchleau Pit (south end) are connected, creating one large waterbody (see Appendix B). For purposes of this report, herein this waterbody will be referred to as the Rouchleau Pit. The Rouchleau Pit does not have any public access and is not identified on the DNR’s Public Waters Inventory. It is estimated to be near 200 feet deep in the Mesabi Mountain Pit section and over 300 feet deep in the southern Rouchleau Pit section. According to City records, in the 1980s the water elevation in the Mesabi Mountain Mine pit was as low as 1,115 feet, and the 2009 peak water elevation was 1,310 feet (see the Water Supply Section of Draft EIS for more information regarding water levels). A MnDOT bathymetric survey conducted in 2013 indicates that the Rouchleau Pit water depth varies between five and over 300 feet. The overall pit depth is estimated to be over 400 feet deep in some areas with banks above the water line that exceed 130 feet on the west side and nearly 170 feet on the east side near the proposed Alternative E-2 crossing (based on contours provided by MnDOT in June 2012). This is a man-made waterbody that is groundwater fed. This waterbody does not meet the criteria for being a wetland due to its depth being greater than 6.6 feet deep. Streams: There are four DNR Public Waters Inventory streams located with the project study area. These streams are identified on Figure 2 and are located along the W-1A alignment.  Wetlands: The wetlands identified for the Build Alternatives are listed in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 1. The wetlands along Alternative W-1A are listed in Table 2 and shown in Figure 2. Table 1: Inventoried wetlands within the Build Alternatives study area WATER RESOURCES TECHNICAL REPORT NOVEMBER 2013 US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT WATER RESOURCES TECHNICAL REPORT NOVEMBER 2013 US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT ¹ Wetland #36 is a complex of small upland and wetland areas. The ratio of wetland to upland that makes up this complex is approximately 50:50. Due to the mixed nature of this area, the entire area was identified as wetland as a conservative estimate and would be further refined as the design concepts are refined. Note: Italicized quality ratings are based on aerial photography (invasive species signature on aerial), prior disturbance, and adjacent land uses (Wetlands 47-128). Table 2: Inventoried Wetlands for Alternative W-1A WATER RESOURCES TECHNICAL REPORT NOVEMBER 2013 US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT WATER RESOURCES TECHNICAL REPORT NOVEMBER 2013 US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT Note: Italicized quality ratings are based on aerial photography (invasive species signature on aerial), prior disturbance, and adjacent land uses (Wetlands 47-128). Environmental ConsequencesDirect Impacts No Build Alternative The No Build Alternative would not impact any wetlands, streams, nor have direct impacts to the Rouchleau Pit. Existing US 53 Alternative The Existing US 53 Alternative would not impact any wetlands, streams, nor have direct impacts to the Rouchleau Pit. Alternative M-1 Seven wetlands were identified within the M-1 construction limits with a total wetland impact of up to 8.8 acres.

Impacts to individual wetlands are listed in Table 6 and shown in Figure 2. This alternative would cross four DNR Public Waterways as shown in Figure 2.  This alternative would have no direct impacts to the Rouchleau Pit. WATER RESOURCES TECHNICAL REPORT NOVEMBER 2013 US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT Table 6: Wetland Impacts of Alternative W-1A WATER RESOURCES TECHNICAL REPORT NOVEMBER 2013 US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT Note: Italicized quality ratings are based on aerial photography (invasive species signature on aerial), prior disturbance, and adjacent land uses (Wetlands 47-128). Construction Phase (Temporary) Impacts Construction phase impacts to wetlands would result from the Build Alternatives for the US 53 project. Temporary impacts may result from equipment access required to build the roadway and structures. The extent of temporary impacts cannot be estimated at this time; however, it is expected that grading and soil disturbance during construction would be mitigated through implementation of best management practices for erosion control. Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures Permits and Approval Requirements Wetland permits from the USACE (Section 404) and MPCA (Section 401 certification) will be required as part of this project. An Individual Permit is typically required for road projects with over five acres of wetland impact. Additionally, MnDOT, as the designated LGU, will issue a WCA wetland replacement plan approval for this project. All of these permits and approvals require wetland sequencing (avoidance, minimization and mitigation) to be addressed. Avoidance and Minimization Measures to avoid wetland impacts will be considered as the preferred alternative is selected and as the preliminary design layout is developed. However, it is not possible to avoid all wetland areas given their size and locations and other constraints required to design the new road alignments; therefore, some level of wetland impact will be unavoidable. Measures to minimize wetland impacts will be considered as the preferred alternative is selected and as the preliminary and final design layout is developed. Wetland impacts will be minimized by narrowing the construction limits and possibly shifting the preferred alternative alignment slightly to avoid wetlands to the extent possible. At this time, it is not possible to determine a specific impact reduction estimate for the Build Alternatives; however, it can be estimated that the impacts may be reduced through typical avoidance and minimization measures described. Mitigation As described in the previous section, measures to avoid wetland impacts would be considered as the conceptual layout is developed. However, it is not possible to avoid all wetland areas given the size and location of wetland areas and other constraints required to design the new road alignments; therefore, some level of wetland mitigation would be required. WATER RESOURCES TECHNICAL REPORT NOVEMBER 2013 US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT The current minimum wetland replacement ratio for wetland credits is 1:1 for WCA regulated impacts and 1:1 for USACE regulated impacts on MnDOT road projects in the northeast part of the state if replacement is in the same Bank Service Area (BSA) as the impact. Because the potential for wetland restoration is limited in the northeast, options for wetland replacement include wetland creation or wetland bank credits. Creating on-site or project-specific mitigation for the project’s wetland impacts may be considered after a preferred alternative has been selected. Areas where wetland creation would be considered include areas where existing four-lane roadway would be converted to two-lane and excess existing right-of-way is present. Due to the previously disturbed nature of the project area, cost, mineral rights, and project timing, on-site mitigation may not be the most efficient or preferred method for replacement by the permitting agencies. MnDOT has access to (i.e., has purchased) established wetland credits in the BWSR Road Bank; however, there are virtually no USACE approved wetland credits in the impact BSA as of Fall 2013. The BWSR Road Bank does contain several hundred USACE-approved wetland credits in two adjacent BSAs (BSA 5 and BSA 6). At the time of permitting, it is MnDOT’s intent to use the closest appropriate USACE-approved wetland credits in the BWSR Road Bank. With regard to the Rouchleau Pit, best management practices for sediment and erosion control would be used to minimize impacts to water quality (addressed in Water Supply and Water Quality sections of the Draft EIS). Summary of Wetland Impacts by Alternative Table 7: Summary of Potential Impacts and Mitigation Required by Alternative ALTERNATIVE No Build Existing US 53 Alternative M-1 Alternative E-1A Alternative E-2 Alternative W-1A  POTENTIAL DIRECT IMPACTS (WORST CASE) 0 0 8.8 acres 6.7 acres 4.9 acres 95.50 acres  MINIMUM WETLAND MITIGATION REQUIRED 0 0 8.8 acres 6.7 acres 4.9 acres 95.50 acres  Coordination The USACE was contacted regarding inventory and quality assessment methodologies.

The main objective of this report is to provide a description of the alternatives development, evaluation, and decision-making process that occurred after the 2012 Scoping Decision Document (SDD) was released. This process included developing and refining the alternatives identified in the 2012 SDD as those to be carried forward to the Draft EIS and an initial assessment of impacts and feasibility. This led to an amended Scoping process that reassessed and refined some Scoping alternatives and resulted in an additional alternative to be studied in the Draft EIS (as documented in the 2013 Amended SDD). In addition, this report summarizes the issues considered in the refinement of alternatives to be evaluated in the Draft EIS and the resulting design features for each of the Draft EIS alternatives. It should be noted that the design assumptions made for this report were based on concept level layouts and standard design practices. These assumptions were not intended to be used to limit future design; rather, the intent was to establish general parameters for evaluation of the extent of potential impacts. This report includes: • An overview of the 2012 Scoping process decisions regarding alternatives to be carried forward for study in the Draft EIS • A description of the 2013 amended Scoping process, including reassessment and refinement of previously scoped alternatives, and resulting decision-making • Description of design considerations, potential impacts, and related refinement of design details for each of the alternatives being studied in the Draft EIS 1.2 Project Background Since May 1960, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) has operated a segment of US 53 on an easement agreement granted by United States Steel Corporation (now RGGS Land and Minerals Co.). This roughly one-mile segment of US 53, from approximately 2nd Avenue West to Vermillion Drive in Virginia, is subject to iron ore mining rights held by RGGS and Cliffs Natural Resources – United Taconite Division (the mine’s owner and operator, respectively). Under the 1960 easement terms, MnDOT agreed to relocate US 53 upon notice from the mine owner/operator. On May 5, 2010, United Taconite (UTAC)1 provided notice to MnDOT that the 1960 easement rights would be terminated. MnDOT has negotiated with RGGS a May 2017 date as the deadline for vacating the existing easement agreement area. 2.0 2012 Scoping Process MnDOT released the US 53 Scoping Document in February 2012, which described the process used to assess the range of initial project alternatives considered. During the Scoping period, more than a dozen alternatives were studied for their ability to meet the project Purpose and Need and were compared 1 United Taconite (UTAC) is a division of Cliffs Natural Resources, Inc. UTAC leases the property from the land and mineral owner, RGGS Land and Minerals Co. For brevity, most references in this document will refer simply to “UTAC.” ALTERNATIVES DEVELOPMENT REPORT OCTOBER 2014 US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT against social, economic, and environmental screening criteria (Exhibit 2.1). MnDOT’s Scoping process resulted in several alternatives being dropped from further consideration based on other alternatives having fewer anticipated impacts. The final Scoping Decision Document (SDD), distributed in September 2012, provided a summary of the Scoping process, including public/agency coordination, the process findings, and the proposed scope and focus of the EIS. The alternatives carried forward to be studied in the EIS included the No Build, Existing US 53, M-1, and E-2 Alternatives (Exhibit 2.2). The SDD (September 2012) can be accessed via the project website for further information on the 2012 Scoping alternatives evaluation and decision-making process.2 3.0 2013 Amended Scoping Process An amended Scoping process was initiated in 2013 due to more detailed information obtained during the refinement and assessment of costs, impacts, and feasibility of the Draft EIS Build Alternatives identified in the 2012 SDD. During the amended Scoping process, some Scoping alternative alignments that had been dismissed from further consideration during the 2012 Scoping process were reconsidered (specifically Alternatives W-1 and E-1). Also, minor alignment modifications to one of the alternatives (Alternative E-2A) were assessed for the potential to improve the feasibility and/or cost-effectiveness of Alternative E-2. As a result of further analysis, one additional alternative has been proposed for detailed study in the Draft EIS: Alternative E-1A (Exhibit 3.1). The Amended Scoping Decision Document (ASDD) (September 2013) summarizes the additional alternatives assessment and decision-making process. The ASDD can be accessed via the project website.3 The design refinement and decisions regarding the two Build Alternatives reassessed in the amended Scoping process but not carried forward for study in the Draft EIS are described in Section 3.1 below. The refinement of Alternative E-1A, which was carried forward for study in the Draft EIS as a result of the amended Scoping process, is described in Section 4.4 below. 3.1Alternatives Not Carried Forward from the Amended Scoping Process As part of the amended Scoping review process, two 2012 Scoping alternatives were refined and reconsidered for further evaluation (Alternatives E-2A and W-1A). However, even with minor adjustments/modifications to make them more viable than the original alignments, the decision was made not to carry these alternatives forward to the Draft EIS as they had greater potential impacts than other Draft EIS alternatives already being studied. The evaluation of these alternatives is described below. These alternatives are shown in Exhibit 3.2. 3.1.1 Alternative E-2A This alternative followed the same alignment as Alternative E-2 except between MN 135 and the new Landfill Road access where it shifted east around a tailings basin, through the Off Highway Vehicle Recreation Area (OHVRA) managed by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR). This shift to the east was made in an attempt to completely avoid any encumbrance of mineral resources. The loop was made large enough to avoid to the extent possible valuable mineral stockpiles and the tailings basin east of Landfill Road that have recoverable minerals. Design Modifications A constrained highway cross section (as shown in Exhibit 3.3) (12 foot driving lanes, four foot inside shoulder, two foot median barrier, and 10 foot outside shoulder) was assumed to minimize the roadway footprint for most of the alignment except at the intersections at MN 135, Landfill Road, and 2nd 2 Available at http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/scoping.html 3 Available at http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/scoping.html US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT Avenue. A 14 foot trail and utility corridor, via a MnDOT permit, would possibly be provided along the north side of the alignment, which would be constructed as part of the project but funded by others. Additional Design Considerations and Potential Impacts In addition to the geometric considerations described above, there were a number of other considerations that shaped this alternative. As with Alternative E-2, this alternative would completely avoid UTAC’s permit to mine boundary (see Exhibit 3.4), minimizing the business risk to UTAC regarding air quality permit compliance. However, moving the alignment further to the southeast encroached upon the OHVRA to a greater extent than Alternative E-2, isolating a large portion of the recreation area that would be difficult to mitigate. To address DNR concerns with this alternative, additional drilling was conducted to determine if this shift would provide the benefit intended (avoiding mineral resources west of Landfill Road). The drilling results indicated that the edge of the formation is 200-400 feet west of Landfill Road; therefore, both Alternatives E-2 and E-2A would avoid mineral resources in this area. With this information, Alternative E-2A was not proposed to be carried forward for further study in the Draft EIS at this time, since it is anticipated to result in greater impacts to the OHVRA while providing no identifiable benefits over Alternative E-2. Design Details • This alternative followed the same alignment as Alternative E-2 except between MN 135 and the new Landfill Road access, where it was shifted east around the tailings basin and through the OHVRA 3.1.2 Alternative W-1A Alternative W-1A was also developed as part of the amended Scoping process in 2013 as a Build Alternative that could avoid impacting mineral resources. This included reassessment of the extent of potential social, economic, and environmental impacts versus the potential benefits of this alternative in avoiding impacts to the Biwabik Iron Formation. This alternative included a four-lane roadway approximately 13.5 miles in length and largely followed existing highways (MN 37 and County Road (Co.) 7). Design Modifications A typical section was used for this alignment (Exhibit 3.3) (four lanes, 12 foot driving lanes, four foot inside shoulder, and 10 foot outside shoulder). This alternative included four grade-separated railroad crossings that would each need 23 feet of vertical clearance. It also included a new bridge that would be constructed at the MN 37/US 53 intersection. Additional Design Considerations and Potential Impacts In addition to the geometric considerations described above, there were a number of other considerations that shaped this alternative. A key consideration was that this alternative increased the travel distance between the cities of Eveleth, Gilbert, and Virginia, adversely affecting businesses and residents. Travel times for emergency response and school district operations also increased. This alternative had large impacts to wetlands and water resources, and it had a substantial user cost increase compared to existing conditions. US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT This alternative was not carried forward for further consideration in the Draft EIS since other Build Alternatives would meet all of the identified project needs with less severe social, economic, and environmental impacts. Design Details • Changes to 2012 Scoping Alternative W-1 in the development of 2013 Alternative W-1A included the addition of a direct connection from Co. 7 to US 53. The connection included intersection improvements at 13th Street South, 17th Street South, and Unity Drive. The alternative also included extensive intersection improvements at Co. 7/Co. 101, MN 37/Co. 7, and MN 37/existing US 53. These intersection improvements were added to provide better traffic flow for travelers by making US 53 a continuous through route to address the identified transportation needs. • Alternative W-1A made its northern connection to US 53 approximately at the 13th Street South traffic signal on the west side of Virginia • Alternative W-1A made its southern connection to existing US 53 by way of MN 37 south of Eveleth • This alternative was approximately 13.5 miles in length and largely followed existing highways (MN 37 and Co. 7) • This alternative required up to four grade-separated crossings (bridges) over existing railroads, which were necessary to provide the safety and capacity required for a four-lane divided highway and forecast traffic volumes • Noise walls were expected to be required in at least three areas: the Long Lake area on the north side of the alignment, Co. 7 manufactured home area on the east side of the alignment, and on both sides of the north end of the alignment • Modifications were required at four intersections, including Co. 7/US 53, Co. 101/US 53, the intersection north of the existing MN 37/US 53 intersection, and the north end of new US 53/existing US 53 tie-in 4.0 Description of Draft EIS Alternatives The following provides a brief description of each alternative and the factors considered in refining the alternatives for assessment in the Draft EIS. For each of the Build Alternatives there was a baseline set of design concept assumptions that were used to estimate the project footprint and assess the potential worst-case impact area, including: • Four-lane capacity, divided with 64 foot median spacing (centerline to centerline) • Typical cross section (12 foot driving lanes, four foot inside shoulders, 10 foot outside shoulders, 1:4 side slopes) However, some modifications were made for specific alternatives as needed to avoid/minimize environmental impacts and/or excessive costs. The alternatives descriptions that follow include discussion of modifications made, where applicable. 4.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) The No Build Alternative responds to the existing easement agreement terms by closing the segment of US 53 within the existing easement agreement area, resulting in traffic being rerouted to existing highways. Signage would be used to officially mark the rerouting of US 53, which would follow existing MN 37, Co. 7, and US 169 (between Co. 7 and existing US 53) (see Exhibit 4.1). No improvements would be made under the No Build Alternative to these roadways. ALTERNATIVES DEVELOPMENT REPORT OCTOBER 2014 US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT Design Concept Modifications The No Build Alternative is required under NEPA to be used for comparison with the Build Alternatives and typically involves no improvements. With the existing easement agreement area needing to be vacated, this No Build is different than a typical road project as permanent traffic rerouting is necessary. Therefore, signage and re-designation of routes is required. During the 2013 amended Scoping process, there was discussion regarding whether improvements were required or should be made to other roadways and railroad crossings, or if new connections should be made to dead end segments of road due to the closure of the existing easement agreement area segment. However, to maintain a true No Build (minimal action) for comparison purposes, no new road connections or improvements are included in this baseline alternative. Additional Design Considerations to Address Potential Impacts Even though this alternative will have substantial impacts to traffic operations, other design considerations were not evaluated or included as part of this alternative. The intent of the No Build Alternative is to provide a baseline for comparison of doing nothing as opposed to the proposed Build Alternatives. Design Assumptions • The US 53 existing easement agreement area would be vacated from MN 135 to 2nd Avenue, including removal of the existing pavement and sub-base • The south interchange of MN 37 and existing US 53 would remain in place, marking the location where northbound traffic would depart from existing US 53 to the newly signed route (existing MN 37) • The four-mile segment of existing MN 37 to be used as US 53 is a two-lane highway with left and right turn lanes located at the intersection with Co. 7 • Northbound US 53 traffic would make a right turn from MN 37 to Co. 7, a two-lane highway, travelling 8.75 miles before making a right turn at the signalized intersection with US 169. Four existing at-grade railroad crossings in this corridor would remain at-grade. • Less than a half-mile segment (0.4 miles) of four-lane US 169 would be used to the east to make the connection back to existing US 53 at the US 169 interchange • MN 135 is currently routed from Gilbert through the existing easement agreement area segment and into Virginia. The designation for MN 135 would be rerouted to the south using the existing US 53 alignment (starting at the existing US 53 northbound ramp to MN 135 and restriping to allow the southbound movement) to the south MN 37 interchange where it would follow the new US 53 route west along MN 37. • US 53 within Virginia, between the US 169 interchange and the existing easement agreement area terminus near the 2nd Avenue interchange, would be turned back to local government jurisdiction 4.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) The Existing US 53 Alternative, though not in compliance with the terms of the existing easement agreement, would keep US 53 in place and open to traffic by addressing the economic, legal, and/or engineering issues associated with resolving the terms of the easement agreement. The State of Minnesota would not vacate the segment of US 53 within the existing easement agreement area but would keep the highway open (Exhibit 4.2). Keeping the highway open in its current location would require the State of Minnesota to acquire the property by direct purchase and most likely the use of eminent domain. If the eminent domain action were successful, the cost of the land may equal or exceed the cost of the ore reserves initially estimated ALTERNATIVES DEVELOPMENT REPORT OCTOBER 2014 US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT at values of $400-600 million.4 Therefore, as part of the design refinement for this alternative, options were considered that would reduce the amount of right-of-way needed to maintain a roadway through this corridor. Design Concept Modifications No modifications to the existing roadway would be made under this alternative. Additional Design Considerations to Address Potential Impacts It has been determined that no changes to existing roads would be required for this alternative if the existing easement agreement area and mineral rights are purchased. However, given the high potential cost of acquiring mineral rights, opportunities for reducing the area to be purchased and overall purchase price were investigated. In other words, it was asked: what is the minimum area needed to maintain a road crossing at this location, which is outside the permit to mine boundary? It is known that mining access would be required under the road so as to not prohibit access to the permit to mine boundary (shown in Exhibit 3.4) north of the existing easement agreement area. Therefore, if mining access could be provided to mineral resources, would that reduce the acquisition/mineral rights cost for this alternative? It is clear that the existing easement agreement area near MN 135 is very wide. Based on these factors, opportunities for consolidating the road alignment and providing a bridge for mine equipment crossing were investigated. A consolidated cross section was considered to minimize needed right-of-way that would include bringing the northbound and southbound lanes of existing US 53 together with an assumed constrained cross section using a reduced median and steeper side slopes (12 foot driving lanes, four foot inside shoulder, two foot median barrier, 10 foot outside shoulder). Because the roadway would remain on in situ rock/soil, by converting the roadway to a constrained section it is expected that the right-of-way needed could be much narrower in comparison to what is there today. However, with mining activity and blasting setbacks, the narrowed right-of-way would not allow the mine to access much of the existing easement agreement area without closing the road during mining operations. A bridge approximately 670 feet long and up to 300 feet tall was considered to allow access to some of the ferrous resources within the existing easement agreement area. Access across the road would be necessary for UTAC to get material excavated on the north side of the road/existing easement agreement area to the crusher and rail line south of the roadway/existing easement agreement area for processing and shipping, respectively. Construction may require temporary closure of the corridor and rerouting traffic to other roadways, similar to the No Build Alternative. The realignment of the northbound and southbound lanes would also require replacing the existing MN 135 interchange with an at-grade intersection. Additionally, by keeping the existing US 53 easement agreement area segment operational and providing mining access under the roadway, it is expected that routing a public roadway through an active mine area may subject the mine to business/operation impacts by having to meet air quality standards (National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter/dust) at the road. 4 The valuation range of $400 to $600 million is based on the potential royalty value of the existing US 53 easement agreement area segment (the land & mineral values) plus the potential business volume (margin) that could be derived from mining, processing, and shipping the iron ore. This range was calculated based on publicly available data about the mine, with input from UTAC and the Minnesota DNR Land and Minerals Division. This estimate does not account for lost jobs or tax revenue if the mine closes or cannot expand. The range is provided for the purpose of comparing alternatives and does not represent a negotiated value between the State of Minnesota and the mine’s owners and operators. A large contingency is reflected in this range because of uncertainty in how the alternative would work both legally and physically. This initial cost estimate may change in the DEIS, as additional information is obtained. ALTERNATIVES DEVELOPMENT REPORT OCTOBER 2014 US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT It was concluded that the amount of mineral resources that would be made accessible by these road modifications would be minimal due to mining setbacks and air quality requirements/constraints. Therefore, the intended benefit of this road modification would be minimal, and it was determined not to be carried forward as part of the Existing US 53 Alternative. Design Assumptions No modifications to the existing roadway would be made under this alternative. 4.3 Alternative M-1 Alternative M-1 is routed through the active UTAC mine (see Exhibit 4.3). The alignment through the mine was initially suggested by the mine operator in a location that was believed to have had most of the ferrous resources removed and backfill generally placed throughout much of the alignment. The following details for this alternative have been refined since 2012 Scoping based on the considerations outlined below. Design Concept Modifications A constrained highway cross section (12 foot driving lanes, four foot inside shoulder, two foot median barrier, and 10 foot outside shoulder) with approximately 1:2 side slopes was assumed through the mine for approximately one mile (4,950 feet) to keep the roadway footprint through the mine as narrow as possible. The elevation of the road was raised to the extent possible to minimize potential business/operation impacts due to air quality standards within the mine. Minimum design specifications for bridge dimensions and locations were obtained from UTAC . Additional Design Considerations to Address Potential Impacts In addition to the geometric considerations, there are a number of other factors that shaped development of this alternative. A key factor in designing the road crossing was the stability of the existing fill material. The depth and compaction of the fill was important in determining whether the crossing could be on fill or if a structural solution would be required. The most feasible pit crossing method was determined after considering two options: • Constructing an engineered fill section across the pit with two separate structures to accommodate mine operations. The structures would be located near the north and south ends of the pit crossing at locations identified by UTAC. • Constructing the pit crossing primarily on structure to address potential fill settlement concerns Borings were conducted by MnDOT to confirm the condition of existing fill.5 A seismic study was also conducted to determine the potential effects of blasting on fill slopes and bridge structures within the mine area.6 As a result, it was determined that an engineered fill could be used across most of the mine with bridges constructed in two locations to accommodate mining access needs. An all fill section would not allow mine equipment to cross the road, and an all bridge section would be more costly. The engineered fill could be constructed with approximately 1:2 slopes, minimizing the footprint of the fill section in the mine (average of 375 feet wide at base of fill). It was assumed that the engineered fill may need to extend down to the pit bottom rather than placed on top of the existing uncompacted backfill material. The depth of the active mine south of this alignment currently ranges from 100 to 200 feet deep. Future mining along the west side of the mine may extend down 500 feet or more; to protect 5 Preliminary Geotechnical Engineering Report (Gale-Tec Engineering, 2013) 6 Proposed TH 53 M-1 (and E-2) Alignment: Report of Seismic Study of Mine Blast Induced Vibrations (HDR, 2013) ALTERNATIVES DEVELOPMENT REPORT OCTOBER 2014 US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT the structural integrity of the roadway/structures, the mining setback may need to extend beyond the fill footprint (toe of slope). Therefore, MnDOT may require a setback greater than the 300 feet from toe of slope required by current mining practice, limiting the proximity of blasting and excavation. By constructing a public roadway through an active permit to mine area and providing mining access under the roadway, it is expected that the road location may result in business/operation impacts to the mine due to air quality standards (NAAQS for particulate matter/dust) at the road. Based on the above information, UTAC notified MnDOT in February 2013 that they no longer could support this alternative. Their correspondence stated that “Cliffs has determined that we cannot risk the future viability of United Taconite by encumbering ore, creating an environmental compliance risk or accepting health and safety hazards that come with the through-pit alignment (M-1), so UTAC cannot grant an easement for the M-1 corridor.” Design Assumptions Even though the current mine operator does not support this alternative, it is being carried forward for further analysis since the opportunities for crossing the ore body are limited and could still be determined a viable alternative. Based on the above considerations this alternative was defined for analysis using the following design assumptions. • From south to north, this alternative would depart from existing US 53 close to Cuyuna Drive in the Midway area of Virginia. Approximately one mile of new four-lane roadway would be constructed to mostly follow the grade created by the partially-backfilled Auburn Pit through the UTAC mine. As shown on Exhibit 4.4, the new alignment would connect back to existing US 53 approximately 1,000 feet east of the existing 12th Avenue traffic signal. • Earthwork and structures (two bridges) would be incorporated into the alignment design to allow for mine operations on both sides of the new alignment • Existing highway connections at MN 135 and 2nd Avenue would be reconstructed to maintain community access, reusing portions of the US 53 roadway to the extent possible. The MN 135 connection would require right-of-way acquisition or a new easement with RGGS and UTAC for the retained portion of existing US 53 within the mine setback area. • The MN 135 connection would be made by routing MN 135 on to a portion of the existing northbound US 53 highway segment south of the current US 53/MN 135 interchange. The new intersection would be at-grade, with the primary turning movement (westbound MN 135 to northbound US 53) facilitated with a free right turn lane. A left turn lane would be provided for the southbound US 53 to eastbound MN 135 turning movement (intersection geometry shown in Exhibit 4.5). This intersection would be signalized. • Due to the proximate location of Cuyuna Drive and the US 53/MN 135 intersection, local street access at Cuyuna Drive would be modified to provide adequate intersection spacing. Instead of providing Cuyuna Drive direct access from US 53, access would be provided from MN 135 to accommodate intersection spacing guidelines. As shown in Exhibit 4.4, Cuyuna Drive would be connected to MN 135 by extending Midway Drive north near the new intersection with US 53. o An interchange option is not being evaluated for this intersection because at this location near Midway there is not adequate space necessary for an interchange above the mine wall without involving substantial business and residential relocations in Midway. • The connection to 2nd Avenue would be retained by using a portion of the existing US 53 highway between 2nd and 12th Avenues, which is outside of the existing easement agreement area segment that would be vacated. 2nd Avenue would be extended to create a new at-grade intersection approximately at the present location of Southern Drive in Virginia. This new US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT intersection would be spaced approximately 1,000 feet east of the 12th Avenue traffic signal. The northbound segment of US 53 to be used for extension of 2nd Avenue currently features four bridge structures: a pair over 6th Avenue and a pair over a now vacated railroad corridor. The northbound bridges would remain in use, whereas the southbound bridges would be removed along with the southbound traffic lanes. Coordination with the local jurisdictions (County and City) would be necessary to make a determination regarding future ownership of these local connection roadways. • The local street connection of 6th Avenue and Southern Drive, which provides access to the Ridgewood area south of US 53, would be improved under Alternative M-1 by adding direct access to US 53 via the new 2nd Avenue intersection. New street connections in Alternative M-1 would be made by retaining the 6th Avenue underpass of northbound US 53 as shown in Exhibit 4.4. Southern Drive would be connected to US 53 at the 2nd Avenue at-grade intersection, with continued connectivity also to the 6th Street underpass. This design would provide new access to US 53 for the Ridgewood neighborhood, while maintaining through traffic to 6th Avenue via the underpass. • Unique measures to mitigate the potential mine air quality exceedances at the roadway have been investigated to protect roadway users from particulate matter. UTAC has identified the limited actions it can take to minimize dust exposure at this location. MnDOT has offered measures to minimize user time on the roadway (breakdowns, stalls); however, these measures were determined by EPA to not eliminate the NAAQS exceedance potential. Therefore, MnDOT evaluated the potential for constructing a covering over the roadway (creating a tube-like tunnel) that would provide such exposure protection. The analysis7 identified a constructible covering (tunnel) and ventilation system that would potentially keep exposure to users under the PM10 limits; however, it would require substantial construction and operational costs. Additional Design Considerations to Address Potential Impacts Exhibit 4.6 shows two alternate alignments that were considered if Alternative M-1 were to connect to MN 135 outside the existing easement agreement area with a two-lane, two-way road. These alignments followed general topography (Blue option) or used existing roadway (Magenta option) where possible. These alignments would require the relocation of at least one business, two to three homes, one to four acres of additional wetland impact (medium quality wetland) and nearly 15 acres of new right-of-way required from 10 or more parcel owners. This option was dismissed due to relocation and wetland impacts. 4.4 Alternative E-1A Alternative E-1A has similar termini as Alternative E-2, but it is routed through the UTAC permit to mine boundary (shown in Exhibit 3.4) parallel to and north of the existing US 53 alignment, following a submerged haul road embankment within the Rouchleau Pit preliminarily identified by UTAC during the 2013 amended Scoping process (see Exhibit 4.7). This alternative is derived from the original Alternative E-1 and has been refined since 2012 Scoping based on the considerations outlined below. Alternative E-1 was initially not carried forward because of potential business/operation impacts to the mine due to the uncertainty of compliance with air quality permit requirements (compared to other East Corridor alternatives), expected higher right-of-way costs due to conflicts with the existing UTAC permit to mine area, and assumed construction costs due to crossing the widest portion of the Rouchleau Pit. 7 Alternative M-1 Air Quality Mitigation Technical Memorandum (CH2MHill, 2013), and Structural Cost Estimate for Elevated Tunnel for US 53 Alternative M-1 Air Quality Mitigation (Kimley-Horn, 2013) ALTERNATIVES DEVELOPMENT REPORT OCTOBER 2014 US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT With additional information gathered for the E-1A Alternative, it was determined that a feasible crossing of the pit may be achievable. Two design options for crossing the Rouchleau Pit are included in this alternative: • RSS Option: A reinforced soil slope (RSS) causeway/fill section with a potential future mine access bridge located on the east side of the pit (see description in Mine Access section below). The future mine access bridge location was coordinated with UTAC and the DNR. The structure would be located near the south end of the pit, above the existing water line. • Bridge Option: Crossing the pit on structure, eliminating the need for fill within the Rouchleau Pit, allowing the road elevation to be increased and drain to the west side of the pit. This bridge would allow for future mine access to the north but may restrict distance from the bridge that mining/blasting activity may occur. A third option was briefly considered which included an alternate bridge crossing location where the bridge would be located off (west) of the submerged haul road embankment. However, given the depth of the pit this area, the pier heights would have been over 200 feet tall. Since the first two crossing options were determined to offer more reasonable design issues, this deep water bridge alignment is no longer under consideration. Design Concept Modifications RSS Option: A constrained highway cross section (12 foot driving lanes, four foot inside shoulder, two foot median barrier, and 10 foot outside shoulder) with approximately 1:1 engineered fill embankment slopes was assumed through the Rouchleau Pit for approximately one-half mile (2,800 feet) to keep the roadway footprint in the pit as narrow as possible (Exhibit 3.3). A 14 foot trail (10 foot bituminous with 2 foot shoulders), funded by others, would be allowed on the north side of the alignment via a MnDOT permit and was assumed in the estimated right-of-way needed for purposes of evaluating worst case impacts. Bridge Option: This option would place the road on a bridge structure across the pit, eliminating the need for fill within the Rouchleau Pit. A constrained cross section (12 foot driving lanes, four foot inside shoulder, two foot median barrier, and 10 foot outside shoulder) was assumed with median and outside barriers. Additional Design Considerations to Address Potential Impacts There were a number of potential environmental impacts and construction-related issues that were considered in development of both the RSS and Bridge Options, including pit water depth, geotechnical (soil stability) information, mine operations, construction methods, dewatering discharge impacts, and water quality impacts. Pit Water Depth MnDOT conducted a bathymetric survey of the Rouchleau Pit to inform the location and design of the alignments (see Exhibit 4.8). For reference, the 2014 pit water level was at an elevation of 1,305 feet, and the city water intake is at elevation 1,117 feet. The survey confirmed the location of a submerged haul road embankment within the Rouchleau Pit that lies five to 30 feet below the current water surface and is approximately 500 to 560 feet wide. Areas adjacent to the submerged haul road embankment range from 30 to over 300 feet deep, with high walls (steep drop-offs) of 60 to 80 feet on the northwest and southeast sides of the submerged haul road embankment. US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT For the RSS Option, the E-1A fill footprint would need to be designed to be less than 500 feet wide at the base to allow adequate distance between the base of fill and the drop-offs into deep water to ensure road fill stability due to the steepness of the embankment slopes and the fact that the base of the road fill will be submerged after construction. Geotechnical Concerns A key factor in designing the road crossing was the stability of the existing fill material in the submerged haul road embankment. The depth and compaction of the existing fill was important in considering whether the crossing could be on fill or if a bridge would be required. In order to evaluate crossing options, borings were conducted by MnDOT (IDEA Drilling, LLC, 2013) to confirm the condition of existing fill within the submerged haul road embankment (see Exhibit 4.9). This information was reviewed along with other geophysical data by Gale-Tec Engineering, Inc. and summarized in the Preliminary Geotechnical Engineering Report for E-1A Alignment (Gale-Tec Engineering, 2013). A seismic study was also conducted to determine the potential effects of blasting on fill slopes and bridge structures within the mine area.8 As a result, it was determined that an engineered fill could be used across the pit at a cost substantially less than a full bridge. However, due to constructability, stormwater, and business (i.e., air quality permit requirements) impact concerns, a bridge crossing option is also being evaluated in the Draft EIS. For the RSS Option, the elevation of the road across the pit was determined by balancing the need for keeping the road as high as possible to minimize air quality and road grade concerns with the need to keep the footprint under 500 feet wide and to minimize the amount of fill required. The engineered fill would be constructed with approximately 1:1 slopes. The maximum fill height would be approximately 160 feet and range from 40-160 feet. It was determined that a typical fill section (1:3 or 1:4 slopes) and even a steep fill (1:2) would not fit on the submerged haul road embankment (greater than 500 feet at base of fill), and therefore an engineered/reinforced soil slope was assumed and confirmed feasible by an independent review documented in TH 53 RSS for Alternative E-1A Memorandum (Parsons Brinkerhoff, 2013). For the Bridge Option, the pit is approximately five to 25 feet deep at the crossing location, and the bridge would span approximately 3,000 feet. The alignment would follow the submerged haul road embankment to minimize pier height. This option must consider design criteria to withstand blasting operations in the adjacent mine. Ferrous Resources Based on the width of the road fill section with the RSS Option, similar to Alternative M-1, there was concern regarding encumbrance of ferrous resources. The recent geotechnical borings also confirmed that the majority of the ferrous resources have been removed from under the E-1A alignment, except in the location near 2nd Avenue on the west side of the pit. Due to blasting buffer zones and other mining regulatory restrictions, it appears the identified ferrous resources will not affect the proposed roadway location due to the proximity of the ferrous resources to the city of Virginia. Therefore, the resources are not accessible with or without the E-1A Alternative, unless portions of existing development in the city were relocated. On the east side of the Rouchleau Pit, the DNR had similar concerns regarding encumbrance of resources under both the RSS and Bridge Options. There are ferrous rich stockpiles on the east side of Landfill Road according to the DNR (landowner) (see Appendix A – Mine Stockpiles). Therefore, the eastern shift of the alignment took into account avoiding the stockpiles to the extent possible. In 8 Report of TH 53 E-1A Alignment Seismic Study (HDR, 2013) ALTERNATIVES DEVELOPMENT REPORT OCTOBER 2014 US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT addition, the DNR raised concerns regarding potential non-ferrous metallic resource exploration (primarily for gold) on School Trust land in Section 16 on the east side of the pit. The DNR also expressed the need to minimize impacts to the OHVRA (a Section 4(f) property) east of Landfill Road. Mine Access The RSS Option would allow for the potential future construction of a mine access bridge on the east side of the pit (above the water line) to allow future mining access to the permit to mine area east of the new road alignment. The future mine access bridge could be sized to accommodate passage of mining trucks (75 feet high by 165 feet wide) under the roadway. By constructing a public roadway through a permit to mine area, and providing future mining access under the roadway, there were concerns regarding potential business impacts to the mine if the proximity and configuration of the road would result in potential for mine air quality compliance issues at the road. Therefore, MnDOT has been coordinating with UTAC on the design considerations for this alignment to minimize such concerns. The Bridge Option would require a separate mine access bridge because the bridge spanning the Rouchleau Pit would provide mine access to the northeast of the E-1A Alternative. UTAC informed MnDOT that it did not have air quality compliance concerns for this option based on road location and elevation with respect to planned stockpile areas and mine traffic. Construction Methods For the RSS Option, road construction across the pit could occur in either wet conditions (fill placed below water level) or dry conditions (temporarily remove water from construction limits). There were two key considerations regarding dry construction: • Water Quality There are measures that have been considered to minimize potential water quality impacts during and post-construction. o Post-construction: These measures include slope stabilization, storm water collection/treatment, and a spill containment system, all of which would be incorporated into the design. o During construction: With construction in the dry condition, there would be limited exposure to the water body from construction materials. By using standard best management practices (BMPs) for erosion control for water crossing conditions and specific BMPs for slope stabilization during construction, potential impacts from turbidity, sedimentation, and road runoff would be eliminated or minimized to the extent possible. Additionally, by specifying that clean fill material (meaning material that is free from contaminants) be used, the potential to release contaminants into the water body would be avoided. • Dewatering Localized dewatering (coffer dam) or a drawdown of the Rouchleau Pit would be required for dry road construction. The water volume necessary to draw the pit down 30 feet is substantial (2.65billion gallons), especially if dewatering needs to occur over a short period of time (estimated at three months for initial draw down), which may impact other surface waters (i.e., the receiving waters) as well as other pumping/appropriation activities (e.g., mining and city water supply). On the other hand, localized dewatering may have issues related to constructing a feasible means of isolating the construction area from the adjacent water column. o Pit Drawdown Method: Potential methods for dewatering were investigated in the TH 53 Relocation Alternative E-1A RSS Construction Option Water Management Study (HDR, 2014) which are summarized in Table 5.2 (attached in Appendix B). Alternative EUS HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT 1A would cross the pit on a fill section and could require a temporary drawdown of current water levels in the entire pit by up to 30 feet during the construction period. The new road fill would separate the western portion of the pit from the larger water body to the east, but they would remain connected hydraulically. Therefore, water levels west of the new road are expected to slowly rebound and equalize after construction is completed. If a drawdown of the Rouchleau Pit were implemented, the discharge receiving waters could be impacted by the initial volume of water generated by a three-month drawdown period (estimated at 2.65 billion gallons). Maintenance pumping to hold the water level at 1,275 feet after the initial drawdown is estimated to be 8.2 million gallon per day (approximately 4,400 to 5,700 gallons per minute). The receiving water options were analyzed in the Water Management Study for their capacity to receive the water volume and the potential water appropriations and water quality permit requirements. Many of the options for a water transfer were eliminated due to the high flow rate associated with the relatively short three month period allocated for the initial drawdown dewatering, which is dictated by the construction schedule. In addition, options were eliminated if the proposed water transfer would impact an existing National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit and require either a major modification or permit re-issuance due to schedule constraints related to the timeframe necessary to obtain the required permits. Feasible options were those that would be considered water transfers between waters of the state (as defined by federal law) and would not be subject to Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) water quality permitting, provided that there is no intervening commercial or industrial use of the water and no pollutants are introduced during construction operations or transfer of the water. Any construction activities within the Rouchleau Pit would require coverage under the MPCA’s construction stormwater permitting program. Conditions of the construction stormwater permit would preclude the introduction of construction-related pollutants to the water being transferred. Based on this evaluation, two feasible options were identified for receiving high-volume flows from the initial drawdown dewatering period and one option for the construction maintenance dewatering period. For all three of the options, potential routes were identified that would have the least potential for environmental impacts (see Exhibit 4.10). The temporary, above-ground (except at road or railroad crossings) dewatering conveyance piping would be routed primarily within previously disturbed areas (road, railroad, utility corridors, and previously mined/graded areas). o Coffer Dam Construction Method: Because the submerged haul road sets on 30 to 120 feet of mine waste rock over Upper Cherty bedrock, traditional sheet pile coffer dam construction is not feasible due to the depth of waste rock fill and ability to obtain sheet wall stability to retain 30 feet of water for a length of 2,800 feet. Therefore, alternative methods are being evaluated, including a geotextile tube system.9These methods would be studied in greater detail if the Alternative E-1A RSS Option is selected as the preferred alternative. Initial dewatering of the construction zone should be free of sediment and, therefore, should be able to be pumped directly into the Rouchleau Pit. 9 A geotextile tube system consists of a series of stacked large diameter (up to 9 feet) tubes being installed underwater and pumped full of sand to create two parallel temporary walls that would allow the construction zone to be dewatered. ALTERNATIVES DEVELOPMENT REPORT OCTOBER 2014 US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT Maintenance dewatering during construction would be pumped to a sedimentation basin before discharging to other surface waters. There were also two key considerations for wet construction, including water quality and fill stability (achieving necessary compaction). • Water Quality As noted above for the dry condition, standard construction erosion control measures would be assumed during and post-construction. To construct in the wet condition, however, additional measures to limit potential for turbidity in the Rouchleau Pit would be expected. BMPs such as installation of floating silt curtain, material specification, and other measures would be important to minimize potential for turbidity during construction. Up to three natural submerged land bridges at elevations 60 feet above the city’s water intake elevation, between the alternatives and the city’s water intake site, limit the potential turbidity that would reach the intake. • Fill Stability Construction of the lower portion of the new road embankment in the wet would be feasible but more complex and expensive then constructing in the dry. It is anticipated that the underwater fill placement would extend from the top of the existing submerged haul road to the current water level (approximately 30 feet). A method for such underwater fill placement is using rock retention dikes. Zoned fill behind the rock dikes and ground improvement of the retained fill have been used in marine environments to construct fill and appear to be feasible for this project. The road embankment above the current water level would be constructed in the dry. Additional measures would be needed for the existing fill in the submerged haul road embankment and the fill placed in the underwater condition to reduce future settlement potential and increase shear strength of the fill to support the engineered fill embankment of the new roadway. A number of specialized compaction techniques have been identified for potential use in constructing this alternative. Local Road Connections Locations for the local road connections were evaluated for both the RSS and Bridge Options. The design concept for this alternative in the Draft EIS assumes that the 2nd Avenue interchange would be replaced with a full access, at-grade, signalized intersection, similar to Alternative E-2. This improves access (currently no southbound to westbound movement available) while eliminating the right-of-way and maintenance needed for the existing interchange loop and bridges (see Exhibit 4.11). There is approximately a 100 foot elevation difference between existing Landfill Road and US 53 at the point where US 53 turns west from the Landfill Road alignment. Placing an intersection at this location on a horizontal curve with an assumed four percent downgrade on US 53 and an even steeper grade on Landfill Road is not a sound option for safety. Reconstructing Landfill Road for a longer distance does not result in enough grade reduction to make this location work for Landfill Road truck access and could require greater impact to the OHVRA area, even with consideration of retaining walls. Therefore, rather than creating a new intersection with Landfill Road, the existing Landfill Road intersection would remain with MN 135 at its current location. However, a segment of Landfill Road would need to be shifted east due to elevation difference between the new US 53 alignment and the Landfill Road alignment. The Landfill Road shift would impact the OHVRA, a Section 4(f) property, while minimizing impacts to the potential non-ferrous metallic mineral resources west of Landfill Road and US 53 as requested by the DNR. US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT Multiple options were also considered for connecting US 53 to MN 135. Due to the elevation differences and the OHVRA boundary, there was one option that stood out: keeping MN 135 on its existing alignment with a slight shift north for the intersection (Exhibit 4.12). Shifts of several hundred feet to the south and to the north were considered, but both resulted in substantial new right-of-way, elevation changes, and impacts to wetlands, stockpiles, and other resources. Traffic volumes and movements at this intersection do not warrant a traffic signal. Westbound MN 135 to southbound US 53 would not be accommodated at the intersection due to potential safety concerns, the availability of alternate routes, and low turning volumes in the peak hours (25 to 35 vehicles). This option will be referenced as the Intersection Option. A compressed diamond interchange was also evaluated for the MN 135/US 53 intersection, as shown in Exhibit 4.13. Other interchange configurations were considered but did not provide full access or did not fit within the confined space between the mineable land and the OHVRA. An interchange would also provide full access and maximize traffic safety by eliminating turning movements to/from a four-lane highway. This option will be referenced as the Interchange Option. Alternate alignments were considered for Alternative E-1A to connect to MN 135 outside the existing easement agreement area with a four-lane road, avoiding or minimizing the relocation and wetland impacts identified in other options described for Alternatives M-1 and E-2. This US 53 alignment shift was incorporated into Alternative E-1A, swinging east from Midway around most of the large wetland before crossing MN 135. Design Assumptions Based on the above considerations this alternative was defined for analysis in the Draft EIS with the following assumptions. • From south to north, this alternative diverges from existing US 53 just north of Cuyuna Drive. The alignment crosses MN 135 between the existing US 53/MN 135 interchange and Bourgin Road. The new alignment then continues parallel to Bourgin Road before turning to the northwest to cross the Rouchleau Pit along an existing submerged haul road embankment on a fill section or a bridge. After crossing the pit, the alignment turns to the southwest to reconnect with existing US 53 near 2nd Avenue. • Alternative E-1A allows for a shallow crossing of the Rouchleau Pit along an existing submerged haul road embankment. The pit water elevation may be partially dewatered (up to a 30 foot drawdown) to expose the submerged haul road embankment, or localized dewatering (e.g., coffer dam) may be utilized. The road would be constructed either via a fill section or a bridge through the pit. • The RSS Option allows for future construction of a mine access bridge to allow for mine vehicle passage under US 53 above the water line. This bridge could be needed to access ferrous resources to the north of the road. The time frame for the future mine access bridge, if needed, is estimated at 30 years. • At US 53 and MN 135 there are two design options: an Intersection Option with a three-quarter intersection (no left turns allowed from westbound MN 135 to US 53) and an Interchange Option with a compressed diamond interchange (see Exhibit 4.13) • A barrier would be considered in the median and on both sides of roadway for safety and screening • All stormwater will be treated and/or removed from the roadway and not discharged directly into the Rouchleau Pit. The stormwater system would include spill containment. US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT • MnDOT would install automatic gates and signage to assist with road closures during mine blasting operations • Any trail (pedestrian, bicycle, ATV, snowmobile) access to the south side of the highway (i.e., the operating mine side) would be prohibited • The Mesabi Trail could be allowed via a MnDOT permit on the north side of the highway, away from the mine activity (constructed as part of the project, but would be funded by others) • The Landfill Road intersection with MN 135 would remain at its current location. A short segment of Landfill Road would need to be shifted east due to elevation differences between it and the new US 53 alignment. 4.5 Alternative E-2 Alternative E-2 is routed around the current permit to mine area (shown in Exhibit 3.4). The alignment crosses the Rouchleau Pit in a narrow area in the middle of the pit (see Exhibit 4.14), with pit walls 130 to 170 feet above the water level. The following details for this alternative have been refined since 2012 Scoping based on considerations outlined below. Design Concept Modifications A constrained highway cross section (Exhibit 3.3) (12 foot driving lanes, four foot inside shoulder, two foot median barrier, and 10 foot outside shoulder) was assumed to minimize the roadway footprint for most of the alignment except at the intersections at MN 135, Landfill Road, and 2nd Avenue. The narrower cross section was assumed to minimize right-of-way required within Section 4(f) land and within land containing identified mineral resources, including the Rouchleau Pit crossing. A 14 foot trail (10 foot bituminous with two foot shoulders) corridor, funded by others, would be allowed on the north side of the alignment via a MnDOT permit. Additional Design Considerations and Potential Impacts There are a number of considerations that shaped development of this alternative concept. A key consideration is the pit crossing method. The most feasible pit crossing method for this alternative was determined to be a bridge. A fill section across the pit is not expected to be feasible due to the depth of the water and pit walls and the width of the fill footprint. At 1:2 slopes the fill footprint at the bottom of the fill would be at least 950 feet wide and require nearly 10 million cubic yards of fill material; with more standard slopes of 1:4, the footprint and fill material needed would double. Additionally, given the depth of water to be contained on the north side of the fill (125 feet currently), the fill would require engineering for a dam to support the water pressure and withstand blasting vibration. The dam design would need to consider future water level increases as dewatering changes occur. Given the extent of footprint concerns, the dam design requirements, and costs compared to a bridge, the fill option was dropped from further consideration. Therefore, the Alternative E-2 concept assessed in the Draft EIS assumes that the crossing at the Rouchleau Pit would be a structure (bridge) over the pit. The pit would be approximately 250 feet deep at the crossing location, and the bridge would span approximately 1,350 feet. This option must consider design criteria to withstand blasting operations in the adjacent mine. Initial feasibility assessments indicate that a bridge crossing of the pit represents a reasonable alternative with respect to constructability and cost impacts. Another key consideration in the development of Alternative E-2 is minimizing or avoiding encroachment onto lands owned or leased by RGGS. To accomplish this, one of the Alternative E-2 alignment variations was designed so that the proposed roadway would avoid any current or future conflict with UTAC’s lease boundary. US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT There is also possible conflict with the exploration and mining of non-ferrous metallic resources, such as gold, on School Trust land on the east side of the pit. Ferrous and non-ferrous exploratory boring locations are shown on Exhibit 4.9. The alignment was designed to minimize impacts to the flood control ditches along the west side of Landfill Road to the extent possible, while also avoiding the mineral rich stockpiles and potential mineral deposits east of Landfill Road. Additionally, the alignment along Landfill Road was designed to minimize the impacts to the OHVRA (a Section 4(f) property) east of Landfill Road to the extent possible. Initially, it was not known where the edge of the ferrous resources was located. To identify the edge of these resources in relation to this alternative, additional study was conducted to determine if ferrous resources are present within the Alternative E-2 construction area near Landfill Road. The drilling results indicated that the edge of the formation is 200-400 feet west of Landfill Road; therefore, Alternative E-2 would avoid ferrous resources in this area. The local street connections for Alternative E-2 are similar to Alterative E-1A, except at Landfill Road, as described in the following design detail section and shown in Exhibit 4.15. Exhibit 4.6 also shows an option that was considered for Alternative E-2 which would provide right-ofway outside the existing easement agreement area for a four-lane roadway for US 53 and an intersection for MN 135 near its current location. This alignment would have a large impact on the Midway area frontage on US 53, requiring relocation of at least six businesses and seven homes. More residential or business relocations and over six acres of additional wetland impact (medium quality wetland) could be required to maintain an access road to the remaining residents and businesses and to provide a noise wall and/or retaining walls along the edge of new right-of-way. This option was dismissed due to relocation and wetland impacts. Design Details Based on the above considerations, this alternative was defined for analysis using the following design assumptions. • From south to north, Alternative E-2 follows existing US 53 from the Midway area and follows the MN 135 exit ramp for the start of new four-lane construction. As shown in Exhibit 4.14, the new alignment then continues on a northeasterly track on the present day Landfill Road corridor before turning to the west to cross over the Rouchleau Pit adjacent to an old railroad corridor. Upon crossing the pit, Alternative E-2 turns to the southwest following an abandoned railroad corridor that runs between the pit and residential neighborhoods before reconnecting to existing US 53 at 2nd Avenue. • With the Intersection Option MN 135 would be slightly realigned to accommodate a new at-grade three-quarter intersection (unsignalized) with US 53, replacing the existing interchange and prohibiting left turns from westbound MN 135 to southbound US 53. A compressed diamond interchange at this location was evaluated (Interchange Option) to compare potential impacts (see Exhibit 4.16). • The 2nd Avenue access would also be converted from the existing partial interchange to an at-grade intersection. The existing 2nd Avenue interchange does not allow for turns from southbound US 53 to 2nd Avenue or from 2nd Avenue to northbound US 53. The new 2nd Avenue signalized intersection would provide access to and from US 53 in all directions (see Exhibit 4.11). • Access to Landfill Road would be maintained with a new at-grade connection approximately one-half mile north of the new US 53/MN 135 intersection. A median break would allow for access to Landfill Road for travelers from both directions on US 53. The US 53 median at Landfill ALTERNATIVES DEVELOPMENT REPORT OCTOBER 2014 US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT Road would provide a refuge for large vehicles making turning movements across US 53 at Landfill Road. 4.6 Areas of Evaluation The areas shown in Exhibits 4.3, 4.7, and 4.14 illustrate the area evaluated for potential physical impacts for each alternative. These “areas of evaluation” were defined based on the general design assumptions outlined herein, estimated construction limits, potential additional right-of-way needed for stormwater management and other related transportation functions, and other design factors. The Alternative M-1 area of evaluation represents the assumed alignment for that alternative. The area of evaluation was widened for Alternatives E-1A and E-2 in areas where there is potential for design adjustments in the alignment to accommodate currently undefined solutions to known engineering challenges (e.g., existing areas of unstable fill and bridge type). The intent of evaluating the wider area for Alternatives E1A and E-2 is to identify potential impacts and determine if there are any environmental resources that could limit implementation of the design options being considered. Since most of the widened area is within the previously mined area in and adjacent to the Rouchleau Pit, the alignment adjustments should result in little difference in impacts to resources except for ferrous resources and right-of-way. To calculate potential impacts for the Draft EIS without overestimating them due to the widened area of evaluation, a corridor averaging 200-400 feet wide was assumed for Alternative E-1A, and a corridor averaging 150-300 feet wide was assumed for Alternative E-2 (the Alternative E-1A RSS Option requires a larger footprint). US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT Appendix AMine Stockpiles THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK ±0 1,000 2,000 Feet Sources: USGS Aerial 2011, DNR Legend Pits Appendix A Existing US 53 Alternative Alternative M-1 In-Pit Stockpiles Mine Stockpiles Stockpiles US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Alternative E-1A Alternative E-2 Tailings Basins Alternatives Development Report THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK US HIGHWAY 53 VIRGINIA TO EVELETH DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT Appendix B Table 5.2 Potential Dewatering Transfer Locations from TH 53 Relocation Alternative E-1A RSS Construction Option Water Management Study (HDR, 2014) THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK Table5.2 PotentialDewateringTransfer Locations Location  Description  Evaluation  Sauntry Creek system including Bailey and Silver Lakes  Sauntry Creek system supplemented with diversion from Rouchleau Pit via Enterprise Pit.

Ultimately drains to Lake Superior.  Closest discharge point 10.5 miles south of Rouchleau Pit alongTH53. Preliminary DNR assessment indicates that the river has capacity to receive rate and volume from initial drawdown and maintenance dewatering. Would be considered water transfer and would not require water quality permitting. Recommendation:Not carried forward as option for watertransfer.  As noted previously, the options for discharge of the Rouchleau Pit dewatering operations were analyzed for their capacity to receive the initial drawdown and/or maintenance dewatering water volume and rates, and the potential water appropriations and water quality permit requirements and implications. Evaluation Results: Initial Drawdown Receiving Waters Many of the options for the transfer of the initial drawdown water were eliminated due to their inability to accommodate either the total volume or the high flow rate associated with the 3month period allocated for the initial dewatering. These include the Sauntry Creek system, Manganika Creek, Manganika Lake, Mashkenode Lake, East Two River and Ore-Be-Gone Lake. The UTAC Hull/Spruce Hill Pit complex and the Enterprise Pit were removed from consideration as options for the initial drawdown volume because of the potential for interference with mining operations. Two other options were removed from consideration because the proposed water transfer and introduction of a new water source could trigger major modification or re-issuance of an existing National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. These included the Minntac Mountain Iron Pit, and the UTAC South Pit. The Pike River was eliminated for either discharge because it would require negotiation of an inter-basin transfer agreement under the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact (Great Lakes Compact) for a new water use, which would not fit within the project schedule. Ely Lake was removed from consideration due to uncertainty of the ability of the outlet to handle the increased volume and outflows, and the risk of water level rise on a highly developed shoreline. The St. Louis River is not recommended at this time because there are other potentially viable alternatives closer to the Rouchleau Pit (describedbelow) that appear to be feasible. The options that are recommended for further consideration for the initial dewatering period are the WestTwo River Reservoir andthe Minntac Tailings Basin Cell2. The West Two River Reservoir is located approximately 5.5 miles west of Rouchleau Pit. It was created in 1963 by US Steel to be used as a water source for mining operations and processing. The reservoir has natural inlets and receives discharges from Minntac dewatering operations. There are two outlets from the reservoir to West Two River, including a fixed-head dam and a siphon-controlled outlet. The siphon, which was included as part of the permit that allowed establishment of the reservoir, provides a minimum flow of 3 cubic feet per second to West Two River to maintain a minimum base flow below the reservoir.

May 1960, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) has operated a segment of US Highway 53 (US 53) on an easement granted by United States Steel Corporation (US Steel, now RGGS Land and Minerals Co., or RGGS). This roughly one and a half mile segment of US 53, from approximately 2nd Avenue West to Cuyuna Drive in Virginia, Minnesota (see Figure 1.0-1), is subject to iron ore mining rights held by RGGS and Cliffs Natural Resources (United Taconite Division, herein referred to as UTAC), the mine’s owner and operator, respectively. At its east end, the US 53 easement segment connects with Minnesota Trunk Highway 135 (MN 135), which provides the inter-regional link toward Gilbert and other communities to the east. Under the 1960 easement terms, MnDOT agreed to relocate US 53 upon notice from the mine owner/operator. On May 5, 2010, United Taconite (UTAC)1 and RGGS provided notice to MnDOT that the 1960 easement rights would be terminated (see copies of the 1960 easement and the letter of termination in Appendix A). Under the original easement terms, MnDOT must vacate the US 53 easement within three years of notification. In response to the notice, MnDOT requested a seven-year timeframe for relocation of US 53. The two parties have signed an agreement to modify the easement vacation date to May 2017. MnDOT is conducting this project process to make decisions on how to best address the pending termination of easement rights. Accordingly, the approximate project termini are on US 53 at 2nd Avenue West and Cuyuna Drive. 1.1 Project Purpose The purpose of the US 53 project is to address the termination of the 1960 easement agreement that affects the current highway location in order to continue to provide a transportation facility that will safely maintain adequate roadway capacity and mobility as well as local, regional, and inter-regional connectivity. 1.2 Project Setting US 53 is a primary north-south route in the upper Midwest. The US 53 “Falls-to-Falls Corridor” between International Falls, Minnesota, and Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, is designated as a High Priority Corridor on the National Highway System. Within Minnesota, this corridor links Virginia, a secondary regional trade center, to Duluth, a primary regional trade center about 60 miles to the south. International Falls, a shopping trade center and a gateway to Canada, is located on US 53 about 100 miles north of Virginia. The project is located within the Mesabi Range of the Iron Range2 in northeastern Minnesota and is set in the middle of the Quad Cities area, which includes the cities of Eveleth, Gilbert, Mountain Iron, and Virginia (see Figure 1.0-1). The land use characteristics within the project area consist of large mining operations, forested land, wetlands, open space, residential areas, and commercial developments. The area is widely known for iron ore mining, and the existing US 53 corridor easement crosses UTAC’s open-pit mine, which extends a distance of about five miles between Virginia and Eveleth. 1 United Taconite (UTAC) is a division of Cliffs Natural Resources, Inc. UTAC leases the property from the land and mineral owner, RGGS Land and Minerals Co. For brevity, most references in this document will refer simply to “UTAC.” 2 The Iron Range is an informal and unofficially designated region that makes up the northeastern section of Minnesota. It is a region with multiple distinct bands of iron ore. From a geological perspective, the Iron Range in Minnesota includes these four major iron deposits: ■ The Mesabi Range, the largest of the four, is largely within Itasca and St. Louis Counties ■ The Vermilion Range, northeast of the Mesabi, is in St. Louis and Lake Counties ■ The Gunflint Range is in the extreme northern portion of Cook County and extends into Canada ■ The Cuyuna Range, southwest of the Mesabi, is largely within Crow Wing County The large size of the Mesabi Range leads many Minnesotans to equate it directly with the Iron Range, in exclusion of the other, smaller ranges. Along with US 53, US 169, MN 37, and MN 135 are the arterial routes providing connectivity within the Quad Cities, to the broader portions of northeastern Minnesota, and beyond. The Mesabi Range is often thought of as the iron ore formation that has been a foundation of the area’s economy since the late 1800s. The most important iron ore deposits are concentrated along a linear geologic formation about 120 miles long and up to three miles wide (Figure 1.2-1). This iron-rich sedimentary rock formation is known geologically as the Biwabik Iron Formation. The Biwabik Iron Formation has a distinct five mile wide meander, or U-shape, near its middle known as the Virginia Horn, which is in the US 53 project area. The central portion of the Biwabik Iron Formation, including the Virginia Horn, has the thickest deposits of iron ore found along the entire formation.3 Figure 1.2-2 shows the Virginia Horn in relation to the project alternatives, as discussed in Chapter 2: Alternatives. In addition to the large presence of Figure 1.2-1. Biwabik Iron Formation iron mining, the project area includes emphasis on outdoor tourism, services, and healthcare, particularly in and near Virginia, the largest of the Quad Cities. The surrounding area features scenic topography, reflecting the region’s geology; woodlands; recreational lakes, both natural and previously mined iron ore pits; and many trails for hiking, bicycling, and motorized recreation. In general, the Biwabik Iron Formation forms naturally high and dry ground in the region, with lower-lying wet soils and wetlands more prevalent in the areas that surround it, including the area southwest of Virginia and west of Eveleth. As iron mining proceeded over the decades, depleted mine pits created new lakes, often with steep shores formed by the pit edges. 1.3 Project Needs The need for undertaking this project is derived from the following elements: ■ Respond to the roadway easement terms; address the requirements set forth in agreements between the State of Minnesota and the land owner ■ Provide a facility that meets regional and inter-regional system connectivity needs and inter-regional highway corridor performance targets ■ Maintain local connectivity to the regional system and maintain efficiency of local connections ■ Provide a facility that serves current and future capacity needs while maintaining system mobility and safety All four elements are discussed in more detail below. Together, these needs support taking action to address the anticipated transportation system problem arising from the termination of the existing easement agreement. 3 The Biwabik Iron Formation is about 175-300 feet thick at its extreme eastern end, as much as 730-780 feet thick in the folded central area (including the Virginia Horn near Virginia/Eveleth), and around 500 feet thick in the western Mesabi Range near Coleraine.

The May 2010 termination of the State’s easement rights is the primary need for action, requiring MnDOT to address the future of US 53 at this location. Under the easement terms, MnDOT must vacate the above-noted portion of US 53. The timeframe for response to the easement compliance, formalized through written agreement between MnDOT and RGGS/UTAC, is May 2017. 1.3.2 Need #2: Provide a facility that meets regional and inter-regional system connectivity needs and inter-regional corridor performance targets 1.3.2.1 Inter-regional and Regional Connectivity US 53 is a High Priority Corridor on the National Highway System. It links Virginia, Minnesota, a secondary regional trade center, to Duluth, a primary regional trade center about 60 miles to the south. International Falls, a shopping trade center and a gateway to Canada, is located on US 53 about 100 miles north of Virginia. The US 53 easement segment provides an important link along this and other inter-regional routes, supporting these long-distance trips. US 53, MN 135, and US 169 are also designated constitutional routes in Minnesota’s trunk highway system, meaning that any proposed route relocation must closely evaluate connectivity to and between various communities.4 In the US 53 project area, constitutional routes are intended to provide the cities of Eveleth, Virginia, Gilbert, and Mountain Iron “…a reasonable means of communication, each with the other and other places in the state…” (Minnesota Statutes, section 161). Similarly, MN 37 between Gilbert and Eveleth is designated as a constitutional route. 1.3.2.2 Inter-regional Corridor (IRC) Performance US 53 is also categorized in MnDOT plans as a Medium Priority Inter-regional Corridor (IRC). The focus of IRCs is on improving mobility along the corridors to facilitate connections between regional economic centers. This focus is reflected in the performance target for a Medium Priority IRC (averaging 55+ miles per hour for the entire length of the US 53 corridor). 1.3.3 Need #3: Maintain local connectivity to the regional system; maintain efficiency of local connections 1.3.3.1 Local Connections to Regional Highway System The need to maintain highway system linkages and route continuity, even with the possible removal of the segment of US 53 through the existing easement agreement area, is a challenge. This challenge is clarified when we review the original easement location decision, which recognized: ■ The need for a direct highway connection to serve many regional and local highway trips ■ The need to cross future iron ore reserves and anticipate conflicts with future mining (the issue now being addressed) The transportation effectiveness of the original US 53 route in serving both local and regional trips is further evidenced by existing and forecast traffic volumes. The easement segment carries more traffic (more than 22,000 vehicles per day) than any other segment of US 53 in the study area. While such focused heavy demand on about one and a half miles of highway is remarkable, it is not surprising given 4 Minnesota’s constitutionally dedicated routes “…may be relocated as provided by law but no relocation shall cause a deviation from the starting points or terminals nor cause any deviation from the various villages and cities through which the routes are to pass under the constitutional amendment adopted November 2, 1920.” (Source: Minnesota Legislature website, Article XIV, Public Highway System, accessed April 4, 2011.) the route’s strategic location. In fact, from a highway network perspective, the US 53 easement segment is comparable to a major river crossing, as there are limited opportunities to cross through the iron formation. Now, as compliance with the easement terms necessitates a new review, travelers continue to need an efficient and effective connection for many trip purposes. 1.3.3.2 Efficient Local Connections US 53 also provides a local connection between the communities of Virginia and Eveleth and is an important link among all of the Quad Cities (Figure 1.3-1). The easement segment of US 53 also connects the main/larger portion of Virginia to the city’s Midway neighborhood on the east side of the UTAC mine. Therefore, the easement segment serves local connections both between the area’s communities and within the city of Virginia itself. Several roads intersect US 53 near the easement segment and provide important connections to the area’s neighborhoods and businesses. To the north of the easement within Virginia, US 169 ties into US 53 as do several local streets, including 12th Avenue and 2nd Avenue. MN 135 connects to the easement segment of US 53 on its east, providing a direct link to/from Gilbert. To the south, in Eveleth, MN 37 and County Road (Co.) 101 tie into US 53 from the east and west, respectively. Further south, MN 37 connects to the west side of US 53 (US 53 and MN 37 share the same segment of highway between Eveleth and the western section of MN 37). With a combined population of about 17,100 (Table 1.3-1), Table 1.3-1. Quad Cities Populations the Quad Cities is a major population sub-area in the Iron (2010 US Census) Range. There is a need to preserve at least the same level of network connectivity and community access as is currently provided. The need for daily east-west connections is illustrated with about 60 to 65 percent of the area’s population located west of the easement segment and 35 to 40 percent located east. In Virginia, the connectivity need includes maintaining a link to 2nd Avenue, which connects the central business district to US 53, to the Midway neighborhood and other points east via the easement segment. City  2010 Population  Virginia  8,712  Eveleth  3,718  Mountain Iron  2,869  Gilbert  1,799  TOTAL  17,098  In order to maintain or improve existing connections among the Quad Cities, including connections that currently use the US 53 easement segment as the most direct route, current travel times between local communities should be maintained or not increased substantially. Examples of community needs that depend on efficient transportation connectivity include the local economy, emergency service providers, and school transportation. Increases in travel time between communities would impair emergency response time, such as police, fire, and ambulance, which is an issue of concern that has often been noted by stakeholders in the project area. In addition to the general concerns, Essentia Health-Virginia is located on Virginia’s north side (on 9th Street) and serves as the region’s main trauma center and hospital. Also, the Mountain Iron/Buhl, Eveleth, and Virginia school districts rely on the US 53 easement segment to transport students throughout the school year. 1.3.4 Need #4: Provide a facility that serves current and future capacity needs while maintaining mobility and safety US 53 must continue to safely and efficiently meet the current travel demand, and continue to do so for projected demand. Chapter 3: Transportation Analysis shows the actual 2009 traffic volumes on US 53 (the most current year for traffic count data) (see Figure 3.1-1) as well as forecasts for: ■ 2017, the year when a long-term plan for US 53 should be fully implemented, based on the background/needs above ■ 2037, the project’s target design year (20 years after 2017) Annual average daily traffic (AADT) volumes are shown for US 53 and intersecting roads within the study area.5 In 2009, traffic volumes on US 53 within the study area ranged from 12,000 vehicles per day (vpd) to more than 22,000 vpd. The highest AADTs, both current and projected, occur on the easement segment of US 53, as shown in Figure 3.1-1, where the 2009 traffic volume on US 53 was 22,400 vpd between 2nd Avenue and MN 135. This segment is expected to carry over 24,000 vpd by 2017 and over 28,600 vpd by 2037. There is a need for US 53 to convey the existing and forecast traffic demands while addressing IRC performance standards and efficient connections, as described in Needs 2 and 3 above. 1.4 Other Considerations In addition to the project needs outlined above, other factors that should be considered in the development and evaluation of project alternatives include: ■ Potential high cost of acquiring right-of-way due to mineral rights As described above, the segment of US 53 that is the subject of this project is located on an easement within land owned by a mining company. Since the project is located in an area where the Biwabik Iron Formation is located, much of the land in the project area has valuable mineral rights associated with it. Depending on the amount of mining that has already taken place on parcels, the quality of the ore deposits, and other factors, the value of the land varies. Overall, however, the value of mineral rights associated with parcels within the Biwabik Iron Formation can result in substantially higher acquisition costs compared to land outside the feasible mining areas. Therefore, the value of mineral rights and how they affect overall project cost is a factor that needs to be considered in developing and evaluating project alternatives. ■ Economic development US 53 provides an important connection within and among the Quad Cities, including providing an important route for local and regional commerce. Potential impacts to existing businesses and to future development opportunities within the cities adjacent to US 53 have been identified by project stakeholders as an important factor to be considered in this project. Changes to methods for shipping iron ore out of the UTAC mine are not expected, as all iron ore is currently shipped out by rail. ■ Use of US 53 as a corridor for utilities The existing US 53 corridor includes permits granted for a variety of public and private utilities between Virginia and Eveleth. US 53 in particular enables utility service to Virginia’s Midway area. Relocation of US 53 and the continuation of UTAC mine operations could effectively sever important utility services in Virginia and to other areas of the Quad Cities. While MnDOT is not obligated to relocate utilities as part of this project, a new US 53 alignment could be used as a corridor for the continuation of some utility services. ■ Consideration of existing and planned pedestrian/bicycle facilities The Mesabi Trail, a non-motorized vehicle and pedestrian trail, currently provides a connection between the cities of Virginia and Gilbert within the project study area. Potential impacts to the trail and opportunities for maintaining a trail connection between these cities should be considered in conjunction with this project. 5 The most recent traffic counts for US 53 and other trunk highways (US 169, MN 135, and MN 37) are from 2009. Traffic counts for most county and local roads were last completed in 2007. Traffic forecasts are based on a one percent annual growth rate. Figure 3.1-1 presents a baseline of 2009 for all segments, with county/local road volumes adjusted where necessary to conform to 2009 trunk highway traffic levels. ■ Provide a feasible transportation solution that is based on first avoiding and then minimizing adverse environmental impacts In addition to the resource issues discussed above, this portion of northeastern Minnesota is characterized by northern mixed hardwood and conifer forests as well as conifer bogs and wetlands. Lakes and streams surround the project area in addition to abandoned mine pits that have naturally filled with groundwater. Virginia uses an adjacent mine pit as a reservoir for its drinking water. Within the context of an open-pit mining environment and nearby location of a public highway, an additional economic concern that must be considered is the potential business impact if the mine cannot meet air quality standards adjacent to the new road alignment. Mine operations near public air space may warrant closer review against National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), which were established to protect public health and the environment. 169 £¤ 53 Mountain Iron 135 Gilbert £¤ Virginia US 53Easement Area 57467 Leonidas December 2014 £¤53 101UV Eveleth Eveleth-Virginia Z Municipal Airport 37 ± 0 3,000 6,000 Feet Source: Environmental Setting Boundary (DNR) Legend Pro Figure 1.0-1 Existing US 53 Easement Agreement Area ject Location UTAC Mine US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Municipalities Draft Environmental Impact Statement 169 Mountain Iron 135 Gilbert £¤ Virginia 53£¤ £¤53 Leonidas Evele th 46757 Eveleth-Virginia ZMunicipal Airport Iron Junction U101V ± 0 3,000 6,000 Feet Source: Biwabik Iron Formation (DNR) Legend Figure 1.2-2 Virginia Horn of the No Build Alternative Alternative E-2 Biwabik Iron Formation Biwabik Iron Ore Formation Existing US 53 Alternative US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Alternative M-1 Municipalities Draft Environmental Impact Statement Alternative E-1A December 2014 US 53 and US 169 £¤ 53 12th Ave W2nd Ave W Virginia £¤ 169 US 53 and 12th Avenue Midway 135 (Virginia) Gilbert Mountain Iron To Aurora US 53 and South 2nd Avenue West US 53 and MN 135 £¤53 US 53 and MN 37 (East) / Co. 101 (West) 7 Eveleth-Virginia ZMunicipal Airport Iron Junction US 53 and MN 137 (South) Leonidas Eveleth U101V December 2014 ± 0 4,500 9,000 Feet Figure 1.3-1 Legend Local Connections Existing US 53 Easement Agreement Area US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Municipalities Draft Environmental Impact Statement 2.0 Alternatives A Scoping process was used to identify the range of alternatives to be addressed in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), consistent with federal (23 CFR 771.123(b) and 40 CFR 1501.7) and state (Minnesota Rules, part 4410.2100) requirements. Section 8.1.1 of this Draft EIS describes the Scoping process and related public involvement in more detail. The process for alternatives development, analysis, and decision-making consisted of four sequential steps: ■ 2011-2012 Scoping Process: During this process a range of alternatives were studied at a Scoping-level of design development to identify alternatives recommended to be carried forward for more detailed study in the Draft EIS. This process is documented in the February 2012 Scoping Document (SD)/Draft Scoping Decision Document (SDD) and the September 2012 Final SDD, available on the project website.1 ■ 2013 Amended Scoping Process: An initial assessment of Draft EIS alternatives was conducted, leading to re-Scoping of alternatives considered previously and ultimately resulting in one additional alternative being recommended for study in the Draft EIS. This process is documented in the September 2013 Amended SDD, available on the project website.2 ■ Draft EIS Alternatives Refinement: A more detailed refinement of the Draft EIS alternatives and construction options took place in order to define them prior to assessment of social, economic, and environmental impacts; costs; engineering feasibility; and other issues. ■ Preferred Alternative Identification: The Draft EIS alternatives were evaluated based on the assessment of impacts, costs, feasibility, and other issues to identify a preferred alternative. Throughout the process, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) coordinated with regulatory agencies, local governments, businesses, and other stakeholders to get input for consideration in developing and evaluating alternatives. The sections that follow summarize the steps in the alternatives development process. 2.1 2011-2012 Scoping 2.1.1 Initial Development of Alternatives A range of project alternatives was developed based on several data sources and stakeholder feedback, including the project Purpose and Need (see Chapter 1: Purpose and Need), previous MnDOT and United Taconite (UTAC) design concepts, and consideration of applicable technical data. During the initial part of the Scoping process, the MnDOT team and stakeholders identified broad corridors for Build Alternatives: West, Middle, and East. The primary differentiating features of the corridors include the following: ■ West Corridor routes avoid ferrous resource conflicts by going around the Biwabik Iron Formation and using existing travel corridors such as highways or railroads ■ Middle Corridor routes provide the most direct connection of US 53 while complying with the requirement to evacuate the existing easement agreement area ■ East Corridor routes allow for maintenance of existing access between Virginia, Gilbert, and Eveleth These corridors are shown in Figure 2.1-1. 1 http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/scoping.html 2 http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/scoping.html Within each of these broad corridors, specific alignments were developed based on available information on physical, social, and environmental factors identified in data collection and through coordination with project stakeholders. Four alignments were identified within the West Corridor, two within the Middle Corridor, and four within the East Corridor. These Build Alternative alignments are shown in Figure 2.1-2 and are described in detail in Section 2.1.3. In addition to the Build Alternatives, a No Build Alternative and an alternative that would keep US 53 on its existing alignment, requiring direct acquisition of the existing easement agreement area (Existing US 53 Alternative), were also defined. These alternatives are also described in Section 2.1.3. 2.1.2 Agency and Stakeholder Involvement During Scoping As part of the Scoping process, a Project Advisory Committee (PAC) consisting of local community representatives was regularly consulted and informed of project progress; a public meeting was held on March 22, 2011; and input from cooperating agencies (US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)) and other project stakeholders was incorporated into the alternatives development, analysis, and decision-making. In February 2012, a SD/Draft SDD was released for a 30-day public comment period (which included a public hearing) to provide information on the Scoping process and preliminary Scoping decisions and to provide an opportunity for formal public and agency comment. Those comments were considered in the preparation of the Final SDD, released in September 2012. Section 7 of the SD/Draft SDD and Section 9 of the Final SDD3 provide additional details of the public and agency involvement during Scoping. 2.1.3 Scoping Alternatives Development, Evaluation, and Decision-Making The February 2012 SD/Draft SDD and September 2012 Final SDD documents4 describe the process of developing and evaluating the Scoping alternatives in detail. The evaluation process included consideration of issues such as how well each alternative met the Purpose and Need; potential for social, economic, and/or environmental impacts; relative estimated costs; and potential engineering feasibility issues. As described in the previous section, stakeholder input was also factored into the evaluation process. The range of alternatives evaluated during Scoping and the Scoping decisions (which alternatives would be carried forward for further study in the Draft EIS and which would not be) are summarized below. 2.1.3.1 2012 Alternatives to be Carried Forward for Study in the Draft EIS ■ No Build Alternative The No Build Alternative would respond to the easement terms by closing the segment of US 53 through the existing easement agreement area, resulting in traffic being rerouted to existing highways. Signage would be used to officially mark the rerouting of US 53, which would follow existing MN 37, County Road (Co.) 7, and US 169 (between Co. 7 and existing US 53) (see Figure 2.1-3). Signs and strategic highway safety improvements, such as striping, rumble strips, turn lanes, signal installation, or signal modifications, as needed, were initially included to address these roads and other connecting roads. No major improvements were proposed in this alternative that required substantial acquisition of new rightof-way. This alternative does not meet the project’s Purpose and Need. However, it served as the baseline for comparison of alternatives and is required under NEPA to be evaluated in the EIS for comparison purposes. ■ Existing US 53 Alternative The Existing US 53 Alternative, though not in compliance with the terms of the existing easement agreement, was proposed to keep US 53 in place and open to traffic by addressing the economic, legal, 3 Available at http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/scoping.html 4 Available at http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/scoping.html and engineering issues associated with resolving the terms of the existing easement agreement. The State of Minnesota would not vacate US 53 but would keep the highway open (see Figure 2.1-4). Keeping the highway open in its current location would require the State of Minnesota to acquire the property by direct purchase and most likely the use of eminent domain. If the eminent domain action were successful, the cost of the land could equal or exceed the cost of the ferrous resource reserves initially estimated at values of $400 million to $600 million.5 While this alternative presents many risks, including the potential for high costs, it succeeds in avoiding and minimizing other social, economic, and environmental impacts through continued use of the existing US 53. This advantage warranted further consideration of the Existing US 53 Alternative in the Draft EIS. ■ Alternative M-1 This alternative would follow the grade created by the now backfilled Auburn Pit through the UTAC mine, providing the most direct route for a realigned US 53 (see Figure 2.1-5). Alternative M-1 would cross a mine operations area that will be active for many years, requiring mine vehicles and equipment to pass under the highway. Crossing over the Auburn Pit was expected to minimize long-term conflicts with remaining ferrous resource reserves and the potential need to relocate the highway to accommodate future mining activities. Key factors in the determination to retain this alternative for study in the Draft EIS were that the direct route (the shortest of the new alignment options) may reduce impacts to business access and community cohesion, and routing over the Auburn Pit in the UTAC mine may reduce ferrous resource encumbrance and natural resource impacts. The corridor also provides a potential utility corridor to retain connections A permit to mine means legal approval has been given by to the Midway area. While business the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Natural impacts due to air quality Resources to conduct a mining operation. The only permit to compliance were a potential mine boundary (extent of permit limits) within the study area concern, this alternative warranted is issued to UTAC as the mine operator and is shown in further evaluation in the Draft EIS.

This range was calculated based on publicly available data about the mine, with input from UTAC and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Land and Minerals Division. The range is provided for the purpose of comparing alternatives and does not represent a negotiated value between the State of Minnesota and the mine’s owners and operators. A large contingency is reflected in this range because of uncertainty in how the alternative would work both legally and physically. metallic resources, an issue to be considered in the Draft EIS is the potential for future mining conflicts. Alternative E-2 was retained for further consideration since it provides a direct route comparable to existing conditions with potential minor impacts to the business community and local traffic, while potentially allowing for the provision of utilities between Virginia’s central business district and the Midway area. In addition, Alternative E-2 could avoid the UTAC environmental setting boundary, which could eliminate the business risk to UTAC regarding air quality compliance. 2.1.3.2 Alternatives Not Carried Forward for Study in the Draft EIS ■ West Corridor Alternatives (W-1, W-2, W-3, W-4) All alternatives considered in the West Corridor made their northern connection to US 53 approximately at the 13th Street South traffic signal on the west side of Virginia. The southern connection to existing US 53 was made either by way of MN 37 (Alternatives W-1, W-2, and W-3) or Co. 101 (Alternative W-4). The West Corridor alternatives varied in length from 9.4 to 13.5 miles. Since other Build Alternatives (i.e., Alternatives M-1 and E-2) would meet all of the identified needs with less severe social, economic, and environmental impacts, none of the West Corridor alternatives (described in detail below) were proposed to be carried forward for study in the Draft EIS. Alternative W-1 Alternative W-1 largely followed existing highways (MN 37 and Co. 7). These routes were both two-lane highways, which could provide a portion of the right-of-way needed for the Alternative W-1 corridor. The MN 37 existing right-of-way is an average of 150 feet, and the Co. 7 existing right-of-way ranges from 80 to 140 feet. The findings of the Scoping assessment (2012 SDD) with respect to estimated construction costs, user costs, and Scoping level social, economic, and environmental impacts resulted in the decision to not carry this alternative forward for further consideration in the Draft EIS at that time since other Build Alternatives (i.e., Alternatives M-1 and E-2) would meet all of the identified project needs with less severe social, economic, and environmental impacts. Alternative W-2 Alternative W-2 included a new corridor connection back to Co. 7, blending the features of highway-and railroad-based alignments. This alternative provided a shorter route than Alignment W-1 by diverting from MN 37 at the railroad corridor, running parallel to the railroad line, and connecting to Co. 7 north of Co. 101. This alternative reduced the number of potential property relocations and the length of the highway corridor compared to Alternative W-1 by going on a new alignment parallel to existing railroad tracks. However, this alternative was not carried forward for further consideration because, while reducing overall length, the use of new alignment would result in greater construction costs and more acres of right-of-way acquisition. Alternative W-3 Alternative W-3 paralleled existing railroad corridors and did not use the Co. 7 corridor, in effect creating a new highway corridor parallel to Co. 7 between MN 37 and US 169. This alternative reduced the number of potential property relocations, stream crossings, and the length of the highway corridor compared to Alternative W-1 by going on entirely new alignment parallel to existing railroad tracks. However, this alternative was not carried forward for further consideration because, while reducing overall length, the use of new alignment would result in greater construction costs and more acres of right-of-way acquisition. Alternative W-4 (Two Options – “A” and “B”) Unlike the other West Corridor alternatives, Alternative W-4 used existing Co. 101 from US 53 through the communities of Eveleth and Leonidas to connect to Co. 7 and turn north toward Virginia. By using Co. 101, more of the existing US 53 highway was retained. Additionally, this alternative recognized the natural route for motorists traveling from Gilbert to Virginia as using MN 37 from Gilbert to Eveleth and continuing on that alignment where MN 37 turns into Co. 101. Unlike the other western alternatives, Alternative W-4 did not avoid conflict with ferrous resource reserves. Co. 101 through Eveleth is heavily developed, with dozens of residential and commercial properties directly adjacent to both sides of the roadway. Due to this urbanized character of the corridor in Eveleth, two options were considered for the Scoping review: ■ W-4A (two lanes through Eveleth): This option tried to limit impacts to adjacent property owners by retaining the two-lane cross section of Co. 101 through Eveleth. At minimum, however, many of the access points in Eveleth would have needed to be closed or modified. All existing and other new segments of US 53 outside of Eveleth would have been four lanes. ■ W-4B (four lanes through Eveleth): This option provided four lanes of traffic, consistent with the rest of US 53 in the project area. This would have required a widening of the Co. 101 corridor through Eveleth, resulting in the acquisition of residential and commercial properties and substantial changes to how the community is accessed. Alternative W-4A was not carried forward for further consideration because it only partially meets the project Purpose and Need. In addition, it would not substantially decrease social, economic, and environmental impacts as it would have substantial direct impacts within Eveleth, so there was no reason to retain this alternative as an approach to avoid adverse impacts. While Alternative W-4B utilized existing travel corridors for a connection between Virginia and Gilbert, the Midway area, or Eveleth, it was not carried forward for further consideration because the expansion of Co. 101 to a four-lane facility through Eveleth would cause substantial community impacts for right-of-way, property relocations, and business access. This route, like the other West Corridor alternatives, would have negative impacts to access in Virginia and would not provide the benefit of avoiding conflict with ferrous resources as would other West Corridor alternatives. Additionally, Co. 101 crosses the existing UTAC permit to mine area and environmental setting boundary, and the mine operator has indicated that it would likely close Co. 101 to through traffic at a future time (estimated by 2024) when it resumes mining in this area. ■ Middle Corridor Alternative (M-2) Similar to Alternative M-1, Alternative M-2 followed the grade created by the now backfilled Auburn Pit through the UTAC mine. Alternative M-2, however, provided an option that would re-join existing US 53 closer to 2nd Avenue, which is an important connection to Virginia’s central business district. The primary benefit of Alternative M-2 compared to Alternative M-1 was that it ran closer to the existing 2nd Avenue access. In order to gain this relatively minor improvement in travel time to Virginia’s central business district, the alignment would cross over known ferrous resource reserves. Alternative M-2 was not carried forward for further consideration because the Alternative M-2 conflict with ferrous resource reserves greatly increased anticipated business impacts and related potential compensation and legal costs/risks, similar to the Existing US 53 Alternative. The value of the ferrous resource reserves in conflict could be less than the Existing US 53 Alternative; however, the compensation values could still rise to hundreds of millions of dollars. Furthermore, Alternative M-2 had many transportation performance and construction cost similarities to Alternative M-1 and did not avoid the potential for mine business risks. Therefore, the extra expense for the additional ferrous resource reserve conflict was not warranted. ■ East Corridor Alternatives (E-1, E-3, E-4) Alternative E-1 Alternative E-1 was the closest of the East Corridor alternatives to the existing alignment. One advantage of this route was the potential for limited or no impacts to the existing 2nd Avenue interchange ramps. This alternative would maintain that straight east-west route, cross the Rouchleau Pit at one of its widest locations, and then turn south near the existing Landfill Road in order to connect back to US 53. The key benefit of this alternative was the retention of current US 53 functionality, including access at 2nd Avenue similar to the existing configuration. However, Alternative E-1 was not carried forward for further consideration in the 2012 Scoping process because, compared to other East Corridor alternatives, this benefit was outweighed by the potential for mine air quality compliance concerns (compared to other East Corridor alternatives), higher right-of-way costs due to conflicts with the existing UTAC permit to mine area and environmental setting boundary, and potential construction costs due to crossing the widest portion of the Rouchleau Pit. Alternative E-3 Alternative E-3 was similar to Alternative E-2; the primary difference was that Alternative E-3 provided a longer route to make the curve from the Midway area back into Virginia. This route still crossed the Rouchleau Pit at a narrow crossing location but had the effect of lengthening the corridor northward into more privately-owned lands before turning back to the existing US 53 alignment at 2nd Avenue. The only known advantage of Alternative E-3 versus Alternative E-2 was greater distance from the UTAC environmental setting boundary, perhaps reducing the potential for proximity conflicts. This alternative was not carried forward for further consideration because it offered relatively few benefits compared to Alternative E-2. Other features of this route would generally require more construction costs or more complex right-of-way acquisition due to greater conflicts with privately owned lands and minerals. Alternative E-4 This was the only East Corridor alternative that did not reuse the existing 2nd Avenue interchange. Instead of connecting back to US 53 at 2nd Avenue, this alternative was routed to the north side of Virginia, where it used the 9th Street North corridor. The Rouchleau Pit crossing was wider than in Alternatives E-2 and E-3. Additionally, the route ran near the existing water intake for Virginia’s water supply, which comes from the Rouchleau Pit. This corridor also ran directly by Essentia Health-Virginia. For consistency of comparing alternatives, a 300-foot wide corridor centered on 9th Street North was used for this Scoping analysis; 9th Street North is an existing four-lane undivided roadway with multiple private access points provided. Alternative E-4 was not carried forward for further consideration for reasons that include the impacts to business access and community cohesion, as well as high construction costs. Potential direct impacts to Virginia’s water supply were also a concern. 2.2 2013 Amended Scoping Process After the SDD was distributed in September 2012, more detailed study of the Draft EIS alternatives and their potential impacts was performed. The initial findings regarding the cost and feasibility of some of the Build Alternatives led MnDOT to 1) reconsider some Scoping alternative alignments (i.e., Alternatives W-1 and E-1) that had been dismissed from further consideration in the Draft EIS during the 2012 Scoping process and 2) assess whether minor alignment modifications to some alternatives (i.e., Alternative E-2) would make them more feasible/cost-effective. In order to add or amend alternatives to be studied in the Draft EIS, an Amended Scoping Decision Document had to be prepared (Minnesota Rules, part 4410.2100, subpart 8). The September 2013 Amended Scoping Decision Document (ASDD)6 and the Alternatives Development Report (Kimley-Horn, 2014; provided in Appendix K) provide details of the Scoping reassessment and the resulting decisions regarding alternatives that would be carried forward for study in the Draft EIS. The amended Scoping process alternatives and the amended Scoping decisions regarding alternatives to be carried forward for study in the Draft EIS are summarized in Section 2.2.2. 6 Available at http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/scoping.html 2.2.1 Agency and Stakeholder Involvement During 2013 Amended Scoping A public information meeting was held on April 22, 2013, at the Mountain Iron Community Center. The focus of this meeting was to provide information on the need for additional alternatives to be evaluated, review the revised schedule and study process, and collect comments and feedback from the public. Comments received at the meeting were similar to those previously provided (summarized in the ASDD), with a strong focus on reasons why the western alternative should remain dropped from further consideration. On August 15, 2013, there was a conference call with the cooperating agencies to provide an update regarding the alternatives being evaluated and solicit input on issues to be considered in the amended Scoping process decision-making. Both the USEPA and USACE stated that they would not request that Alternative W-1A (see description in Section 2.2.2.1) be carried forward for further analysis in the Draft EIS. An economic study was initiated specifically to evaluate the potential impacts to businesses and residents of the Quad Cities from closure of the US 53 existing easement agreement area segment or rerouting traffic to the west (No Build and W-1A Alternatives) as compared to other Build Alternatives (M-1, E-1A, E-2). The study was completedin January 2014 and is available on the project website.7A number of public meetings were held specific to the economic study to inform the public of the scope of the study and to obtain input on perceived impacts. As new alternatives were developed and evaluated, other agency and stakeholder coordination (with UTAC, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), school districts, and cities) was also initiated to identify opportunities and impacts. 2.2.2 Alternatives Considered in 2013 Amended Scoping 2.2.2.1 Alternatives Added or Modified for Study in the Draft EIS ■ No Build Alternative During the amended Scoping process, the No Build Alternative was revised so that it no longer included the minor improvements described in Section 2.1.3.1, such as turn lanes, striping, and signal modifications. This revised No Build Alternative reflects a true No Build Alternative in which minimal investments are made. As noted in Chapter 1: Purpose and Need, this alternative does not meet the stated needs of the project. ■ Alternative E-1A Alternative E-1A is the closest of the East Corridor alternatives to the existing US 53 alignment (see Figure 2.2-1). The corridor makes its northern connection in vicinity of the 2nd Avenue interchange and maintains a direct connection to the southern reach of US 53 over the Rouchleau Pit. This alternative is a modified version of Alternative E-1, which was initially not retained for consideration in the Draft EIS because Alternative E-2 was thought at the time to provide a more feasible eastern alignment. The modifications to Alternative E-1 included shifting the alignment further to the west over the Rouchleau Pit, resulting in a shallower crossing of the pit along an existing submerged haul road embankment, which may result in fewer ferrous resource impacts. The E-1A alignment was also shifted further to the southeast between Cuyuna Drive and MN 135 to accommodate potential mine operational space needs. Alternative E-1 was initially not carried forward in the SDD because of the uncertainty of compliance with mine air quality requirements (compared to other East Corridor alternatives), potentially higher right-ofway costs due to conflicts with the existing UTAC permit to mine area and environmental setting boundary, and construction costs due to crossing the widest portion of the Rouchleau Pit. With the modifications to this alternative, a feasible crossing would be achievable. Alternative E-1A would allow 7 http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/TechnicalReports.html development of options to cross the Rouchleau Pit with or without a bridge; crossing the pit without a bridge may involve partial dewatering of the pit during construction. This alternative remains within the environmental setting boundary; however, UTAC has completed a business risk assessment analysis that indicated low risk regarding the ability to meet its permit requirements with this alternative. Further details are provided in Sections 2.3.4 and 4.2.3.3. 2.2.2.2 Alternatives Not Carried Forward for Study in the Draft EIS ■ Alternative W-1A Alternative W-1A was developed as part of the re-Scoping process in 2013. This included reassessment of the extent of potential social, economic, and environmental impacts versus the potential benefits of this alternative in avoiding impacts to the Biwabik Iron Formation. One change to Alternative W-1 from the initial SD/SDD was the addition of a direct connection from Co. 7 to US 53. The connection would include intersection improvements at 13th Street South, 17th Street South, and Unity Drive. This alternative would also include extensive intersection improvements at Co. 7/Co. 101, MN 37/Co. 7, and MN 37/existing US 53. These intersection improvements were added to provide better traffic flow for travelers by making US 53 a continuous through-route to better address the identified transportation needs. Alternative W-1A would make its northern connection to US 53 approximately at the 13th Street South traffic signal on the west side of Virginia. The southern connection to existing US 53 is made by way of MN 37.This alternative is approximately 13.5 miles in length and largely follows existing highways (MN 37 and Co. 7). As documented in the 2013 ASDD, Alternative W-1A would result in increased travel distances between the cities of Eveleth, Gilbert, and Virginia, adversely affecting businesses, residents, emergency response times, and school district operations. This alternative would also result in large impacts to wetlands and water resources and would have a substantial user cost increase compared to existing conditions. This alternative was not carried forward for further consideration in the Draft EIS since other Build Alternatives (i.e., M-1, E-1A, and E-2) would meet all of the identified project needs with less severe social, economic, and environmental impacts. ■ Alternative E-2A Alternative E-2A is a sub-alternative of Alternative E-2 that was evaluated in addition to Alternative E-2. A section of Alternative E-2 north of MN 135 was shifted further to the east in an attempt to completely avoid any encumbrance of ferrous resources and/or mining exploration (non-ferrous metallic resource leases) at the edge of the permit to mine boundary, Biwabik Iron Formation, and mineral rich stockpiles along Landfill Road. The shift was made largely to avoid valuable stockpiles and the tailings basin east of Landfill Road that may have recoverable ferrous resources. Alternative E-2A would maintain many of the benefits of Alternative E-2, including complete avoidance of the UTAC permit to mine boundary, minimizing the business risk to UTAC regarding future air quality compliance. However, moving the alignment further to the southeast would encroach upon the Iron Range Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area (OHVRA) to a greater extent than Alternative E-2, isolating a large portion of the recreation area that would be difficult to mitigate. To address DNR concerns with this alternative, additional study was conducted to determine if this shift would provide the benefit intended. Drilling was conducted to determine if ferrous resources are present near Landfill Road. Borings located 200 to 400 feet west of Landfill Road showed essentially no ferrous resources, indicating that the edge of the formation lies further west of these test sites. With that knowledge, Alternative E-2A was not proposed to be carried forward for further study in the Draft EIS since it was anticipated to result in substantial impacts to the OHVRA while providing no identifiable benefits over Alternative E-2. 2.3 Draft EIS Alternatives As the Draft EIS analysis continued, design details were refined as new information was obtained and decisions were made regarding construction options. These design assumptions and decisions are documented in the Alternatives Development Report (Kimley-Horn, 2014; provided in Appendix K). Agencies and key stakeholders continued to be engaged during the preparation of the Draft EIS in the development of information for the evaluation of impacts and mitigation. This section provides a more detailed description of each alternative evaluated in this Draft EIS. All alternatives that have been carried forward for further study are shown on Figure 2.3-1. Each alternative has a defined area of evaluation based on general design assumptions, estimated construction limits, potential additional right-of-way needed for stormwater management and other related transportation functions, and other design factors. Staging areas, if required outside of the areas of evaluation, will be identified for the preferred alternative and evaluated in the Final EIS. These areas of evaluation were used to evaluate physical impacts in areas where ground disturbance is likely to occur under one or more construction option. Impacts related to aspects of the project other than ground disturbance (e.g., noise, economic, and community impacts) that may extend beyond the areas of evaluation were also evaluated and are discussed in the following chapters. Refinement in design and social, environmental, and economic impact analysis will occur for the preferred alternative prior to the issuance of the Final EIS. 2.3.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) The No Build Alternative would respond to the easement terms by closing the segment of US 53 within the existing easement agreement area, resulting in traffic being rerouted to existing highways. Signage would be used to officially mark the rerouting of US 53, which would follow existing MN 37, Co. 7, and US 169 (see Figure 2.1-3). No transportation systems management (TSM) elements (i.e., maintenance or operation improvements) are included in this alternative in order to represent a true No Build Alternative and because TSM improvements on the existing roadways would not provide the needed traffic capacity given the closure of the existing easement agreement area. The following existing roadways would be designated as the official reroute of US 53 in their current condition: ■ The south interchange of MN 37 and existing US 53 would remain in place, marking the location where northbound traffic would depart from existing US 53 to the newly signed route (existing MN 37) ■ The four-mile segment of existing MN 37 to be used as US 53 is a two-lane highway with left and right turn lanes located at the intersection with Co. 7. Existing at-grade railroad crossings in this corridor would remain at-grade. ■ Northbound US 53 traffic would make a right turn from MN 37 to Co. 7, a two-lane highway, traveling 8.75miles before making a right turn at the signalized intersection with US 169. Existing at-grade railroad crossings in this corridor would remain at-grade. ■ Less than a half-mile segment (0.4 miles) of four-lane US 169 would be used to the east to make the connection back to existing US 53 at the US 169 interchange MN 135 is currently routed from Gilbert through the existing easement agreement area and into Virginia. The designation for MN 135 would be rerouted to the south using the existing US 53 alignment (starting at the existing US 53 northbound ramp to MN 135) to the south MN 37 interchange where it would follow the new US 53 route west along MN 37 (Figure 2.1-3). US 53 within Virginia, between the US 169 interchange and the 2nd Avenue interchange, would be turned back to local government jurisdiction. This alternative does not meet project Need #3 (connectivity/travel times) or #4 (capacity/mobility) described in Section 1.3.3 and 1.3.4, respectively. To meet Need #2 (constitutional route connectivity) as described in Section 1.3.2, signing and road designation changes would be needed to maintain the road connection from Eveleth to Virginia. However, it is an important baseline for the comparison of alternatives and is required to be evaluated in the Draft EIS for comparison purposes under NEPA and the Minnesota Environmental Review program. ■ Area of Evaluation Under the No Build Alternative, no construction would occur, and traffic would be rerouted to other roads. Therefore, the area evaluated includes the existing right-of-way of those reroute roads. 2.3.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) The Existing US 53 Alternative, though not in compliance with the terms of the existing easement agreement, would keep US 53 in place and open to traffic by addressing the economic, legal, and engineering issues associated with resolving the terms of the existing easement agreement. The State of Minnesota would not vacate US 53 but would keep the highway open (Figure 2.1-4). Keeping the highway open in its current location would require condemnation by the State of Minnesota to oppose termination of the existing easement agreement knowing that the owner and lessee are not willing sellers. Even with the use of eminent domain, this alternative may require a large payment from the State to the owners and operators of the minerals and mining/lease rights (RGGS and UTAC). Under this alternative, no roadway modifications would be made. While it was noted in the SDD (September 2012) that this alternative may include construction of a grade separation and other highway modifications to allow for the mine to function as one operation from both sides of US 53, it did not present details. As described in the Alternatives Development Report (Kimley-Horn, 2014; provided in Appendix K), consolidation of right-of-way and constructing a bridge for mine access were considered but determined to not provide a meaningful reduction in overall project costs or provide the mine with access to much of the existing easement agreement area to mine to offset reconstruction costs; therefore, these elements are not being further evaluated. This alternative was found in the SD/Draft SDD (February 2012) to meet all four need criteria. This alternative would indirectly honor the terms of the existing easement agreement (Need #1) by compensating the landowner and operator for land and mineral rights. ■ Area of Evaluation Under the Existing US 53 Alternative, no construction would occur, and traffic would remain on existing US 53. Therefore, the area evaluated includes the existing right-of-way/easement agreement area of existing US 53. 2.3.3 Alternative M-1 All of the Build Alternatives under consideration in this Draft EIS assume construction of a new four-lane US 53 alignment. Alternative M-1 is routed through the active UTAC mine. The following details for this alternative have been refined since Scoping based on considerations of providing mine access to both sides of the new US 53 alignment, existing fill material stability, depth of current and future mining activity, embankment design in blasting zone, and structural options (bridge vs. engineered slopes). ■ New Alignment From south to north, this alternative would depart from existing US 53 approximately at Cuyuna Drive in the Midway area of Virginia. Approximately one mile of new four-lane roadway would be constructed to mostly follow the grade created by thepartially-backfilled8Auburn Pit through the UTACmine. As shown on Figure 2.1-5, the new alignment would connect back to existing US 53 approximately 1,000 feet east of the existing 12th Avenue traffic signal. ■ Local Access Existing highway connections at MN 135 and 2nd Avenue would be reconstructed to maintain community access, reusing portions of the US 53 roadway to the extent possible. The MN 135 connection would require right-of-way acquisition or a new easement with RGGS and UTAC for the retained portion of existing US 53 within the mine setback area (Figure 2.3-2). The MN 135 connection would be made by routing MN 135 on to a portion of the existing northbound US 53 highway segment south of the current US 53/MN 135 interchange. The new access would be at-grade, with the primary turning movement (westbound MN 135 to northbound US 53) facilitated with a free right turn lane. A left turn lane would be provided for the southbound US 53 to eastbound MN 135 turning movement. This intersection would be signalized (intersection geometry shown in Figure 3.1-4). Due to the proximate location of Cuyuna Drive and the US 53/MN 135 intersection, local street access at Cuyuna Drive would be modified to provide adequate intersection spacing. Instead of providing Cuyuna Drive direct access from US 53, access would be provided from MN 135 to accommodate intersection spacing guidelines. As shown in Figure 2.3-2, Cuyuna Drive would be connected to MN 135 by extending Midway Drive north near the new intersection with US 53. An interchange option for this US 53 connection to MN 135 is not feasible in this location because there is not adequate space necessary for an interchange above the mine wall without involving substantial business and residential relocations in Midway. There is approximately 800 feet between the edge of the Auburn Pit wall and Cuyuna Drive, so a compressed diamond interchange (assumed to be approximately 2,000 feet long) would either have 1,200 feet of the interchange supported by structure in the pit or would require the acquisition of multiple residential and business properties in the Midway neighborhood. Given the extent of impacts and constructability concerns, an interchange at MN 135/US 53 was determined to not be feasible. The connection to 2nd Avenue would be made by using a portion of the existing US 53 highway between 2nd and 12th Avenues, which is outside of the existing easement agreement area segment that would be vacated. 2nd Avenue would be extended to create a new at-grade intersection approximately at the present location of Southern Drive in Virginia. This new Southern Drive intersection would be spaced approximately 1,000 feet east of the 12th Avenue traffic signal. The northbound segment of US 53 to be used for extension of 2nd Avenue currently features four bridge structures (a pair over 6th Avenue and a pair over a now vacated railroad corridor). The northbound bridges would remain in use, whereas the southbound bridges would be removed along with the southbound traffic lanes. Coordination with the local jurisdictions (County and City) would be necessary to make a determination regarding future ownership of these local connection roadways. The local street connection of 6th Avenue and Southern Drive, which provides access to the Ridgewood area south of US 53, would be improved by the Alternative M-1 alignment by adding direct access to US 53 via the new Southern Drive intersection (which would also provide access to 2nd Avenue as described above). New street connections in Alternative M-1 would be made by retaining the 6th Avenue underpass of northbound US 53 as shown in Figure 2.3-2. Southern Drive would be connected to US 53 at the Southern Drive at-grade intersection, with continued connectivity to the 6th Street underpass. This design would provide new access to US 53 for the Ridgewood neighborhood, while maintaining through traffic to 6th Avenue via the underpass. ■ Design Features Alternative M-1 would cross a mine area that will remain active for many years. In order to reduce the potential conflict with remaining ferrous resource reserves, a constrained highway cross section (Figure 2.3-3) was assumed for US 53 through the mine for approximately one mile (4,950 feet). The constrained 8 Backfilled material is from local sources within the mine boundary. See Section 5.12 for more detail. cross section assumed median and outside barriers and steep side slopes. The depth of the active mine south of this alignment currently ranges from 100 to 200 feet deep. Future mining along the west side of the mine may extend down 500 feet or more. The proposed right-of-way through the mine would encompass the full road footprint. Standard blasting best practices by the mine include a 300 foot setback from the edge of right-of-way. If this setback encumbers ferrous resources, the loss of access to these resources would be expected to be included in the negotiation for acquisition of right-of-way for this alternative. Earthwork and/or structures (bridges) would be incorporated into the alignment design to allow for mine operations on both sides of the new alignment. The depth of the fill and compaction was important in determining whether the crossing could be on fill or if a structural solution would be required. Borings were conducted by MnDOT to confirm the condition of existing fill.9 A seismic study was also conducted to determine the potential effects of blasting on fill slopes and bridge structures within the mine area.10 As a result it was determined that an engineered fill could be used across most of the mine with bridges constructed in two locations to accommodate mining access needs. An all fill section would not allow mine equipment to cross the road, and an all bridge section would be more costly with no additional benefit gained. The engineered fill could be constructed with 1:2 slopes, minimizing the footprint of the fill section in the mine. The depth of the active mine south of this alignment currently ranges from 100 to 200 feet deep. Future mining along the west side of the mine may extend down 500 feet or more. To address potential mine business risks (air quality compliance issues), a covering over a portion of the Auburn Pit crossing (an elevated tunnel concept) was evaluated as a potential mitigation strategy. This tunnel could be constructed with concrete barrier walls on each side supporting a three-sided concrete box structure to enclose the road and air handling equipment. Details of the tunnel construction assumptions can be found in Highway 53 M-1 Alignment Air Quality Mitigation Assessment (CH2M Hill, 2013) and the Structural Cost Estimate for Elevated Tunnel for US 53 Alternative M-1 Air Quality Mitigation (Kimley-Horn, 2013) provided in Appendix E. This alternative was found in the SD/Draft SDD (February 2012) to meet all four need criteria. ■ Area of Evaluation The potential physical impacts from this alternative were evaluated for the area shown in Figure 2.1-5. Physical impacts can be defined as areas where ground disturbance is likely to occur under one or more construction option. As noted above, this alternative would require fill across much of the Auburn Pit. The area of evaluation for Alternative M-1 represents the assumed alignment and extends to the bottom of the fill slope or the estimated limits of construction. It also includes areas anticipated for stormwater management and local road connections. 2.3.4 Alternative E-1A Alternative E-1A is routed through the UTAC permit to mine and environmental setting boundaries, north of existing US 53 (see Figure 2.2-1). This alternative was added through the amended Scoping process described in Section 2.2. Alternative E-1 was initially not carried forward because of the potential for mine business risks due to air quality compliance concerns (compared to other East Corridor alternatives), higher right-of-way costs due to conflicts with the existing UTAC permit to mine area and environmental setting boundary, and construction costs due to crossing the widest portion of the Rouchleau Pit. However, additional assessment of construction options and modification of this alternative determined 9 Preliminary Geotechnical Engineering Report for the TH 53 Relocation: M-1 Foundations (Gale-Tec Engineering, 2013); available at http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/TechnicalReports.html 10 Proposed TH 53 M-1 (and E-2) Alignment, Virginia, MN: Report of Seismic Study of Mine Blast Induced Vibrations (HDR, 2013); available at http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/TechnicalReports.html that Alternative E-1A could reduce the business risk impacts from mine air quality compliance concerns. The features of this alternative assumed for analysis in this Draft EIS are described below. ■ New Alignment From south to north, this alternative diverges from existing US 53 just north of Cuyuna Drive. The alignment crosses MN 135 between the existing US 53 interchange and Bourgin Road. The new alignment then continues parallel to Bourgin Road before turning to the northwest to cross the Rouchleau Pit along an existing submerged haul road embankment.11 After crossing the pit, the alignment turns to the southwest to reconnect with existing US 53 near 2nd Avenue. The road cross section was assumed to be constrained across the Rouchleau Pit (four lanes with a two-foot wide median barrier). A barrier would be considered on the south side of the roadway for safety and screening reasons. All stormwater would be treated and/or removed from the roadway and not discharged directly into the Rouchleau Pit. The storm sewer system would also allow containment of any potential spills on the roadway. Two construction design options for crossing the Rouchleau Pit are evaluated for this alternative. The first is a reinforced soil slope (RSS) causeway/fill section (RSS Option). The second option is a bridge crossing of the pit (Bridge Option). Both options would follow the existing submerged haul road across the Rouchleau Pit. ■ RSS Option: This option would require the placement of fill below the existing water level and extending up to 160 feet in elevation above the water line. To minimize the fill footprint, a steep fill slope (up to 60% slope) would be required, and the height of the road would be kept as low as possible across the pit, resulting in a low point near the middle of the crossing. (Construction methods [i.e., dry vs. wet fill placement] for this design option are described in Section 5.3.3.2.) This option may require a future bridge (75 feet by 165 feet) to be constructed east of the Rouchleau Pit to allow for mining access to the north of the new alignment. ■ Bridge Option: This option would place the road on a bridge structure across the pit, eliminating the need for fill within the Rouchleau Pit and allowing the road elevation to be increased and drain to the west side of the pit. This bridge would allow for future mine access to the north but may restrict distance from the bridge that mining/blasting activity may occur. Any trail (pedestrian, bicycle, ATV, snowmobile) access to the south side of the highway would be prohibited due to mine safety concerns. The Mesabi Trail and utilities may be allowed within MnDOT rightof-way (with the trail on the north side of the highway, away from the mine activity) via a permit (may be constructed in conjunction with the project but funded by the trail and utility owners/operators; the St. Louis and Lake Counties Regional Railroad Authority (SLLCRRA) and the utility owners have received state bond funds for utility and trail relocation). ■ Local Access The 2nd Avenue interchange would be replaced with a full access, at-grade, signalized intersection, similar to Alternative E-2 (Figure 2.3-4). This improves access (currently no southbound to westbound movement available) while eliminating the right-of-way and maintenance needed for the existing interchange loop and bridges. There are two intersection options evaluated for MN 135 at US 53. ■ Intersection Option: An unsignalized, ¾ intersection12 would be used at the US 53/MN 135 intersection, with no left turns allowed from westbound MN 135 to US 53 11 Backfilled material in this haul road is from local sources within the mine boundary. See Section 5.12 for more detail. 12 A ¾ intersection (also known as a right-in/right-out/left-in-only intersection) permits access from the through approach (US 53) and the stop-controlled approach (MN 135) via right-turn movements and allows the left-turn movement from the through approach (US 53) to the stop-controlled approach (MN 135). (intersection geometry shown in Figure 2.3-5). ■ Interchange Option: A compressed diamond interchange would provide full access between US 53 and MN 135, as shown in Figure 2.3-5. The Landfill Road intersection with MN 135 would remain at its current location. A short segment of Landfill Road would need to be shifted east due to elevation differences between it and the new US 53 alignment. ■ Design Features This alternative is within the UTAC permit to mine and environmental setting boundaries, although little further conflict with remaining ferrous resources is anticipated. In order to reduce the amount of fill within the Rouchleau Pit, a constrained highway cross section (Figure 2.3-3) was assumed for US 53 through the pit for approximately one-half mile (2,800 feet). The constrained cross section assumed median and outside barriers under both the RSS and Bridge Options. ■ RSS Option: This option would allow for a shallower crossing of the Rouchleau Pit along an existing submerged haul road embankment. The pit may be partially dewatered or local construction dewatering (e.g., coffer dam) may be used, and the road would be constructed via a fill section through the pit. A mine access bridge southeast of the Rouchleau Pit could eventually be constructed in the future, if needed, to allow for mine vehicle passage under US 53 above the current water line. A number of dewatering discharge options have been evaluated to inform potential construction impact analysis. Details regarding the options assessed can be found in the TH 53 Relocation Alternative E-1A RSS Construction Option Water Management Study (HDR, 2014), provided in Appendix G. The effects of constructing the Rouchleau Pit crossing in the dry (via pit drawdown or localized dewatering) and in the wet (fill placed below water) condition are evaluated in Sections 5.2 and 5.3, providing a summary of the recommended options for dewatering discharge and their potential impacts. ■ Bridge Option: The pit is approximately five to 25 feet deep at the crossing location, and the bridge would span approximately 3,000 feet. The alignment would follow the submerged haul road embankment to minimize pier height. This option must consider design criteria to withstand blasting operations in the adjacent mine and areas of potential unstable fill. This alternative was found in the ASDD (September 2013) to meet all four need criteria. ■ Area of Evaluation The potential physical impacts from this alternative were evaluated for the area shown in Figure 2.2-1. Physical impacts can be defined as areas where ground disturbance is likely to occur under one or more construction option. As noted above, this alternative includes two options for crossing the Rouchleau Pit generally following the submerged haul road. The area of evaluation was widened across the Rouchleau Pit for Alternative E-1A in areas where there is potential for design adjustments in the alignment to accommodate currently undefined solutions to known engineering challenges (e.g., existing areas of unstable fill and bridge type). The intent of evaluating the wider area was to identify potential impacts and determine if there were any environmental resources that could limit implementation of the design options being considered. As determined by analysis of aerial photography and data collection within the widened area of evaluation, it generally has consistent vegetation/cover types (i.e., mostly forested with some wetlands, or rock pit walls and water) and has no existing development or noise receptors. Since most of the widened area is within the previously mined area in and adjacent to the Rouchleau Pit, the alignment adjustments should result in little difference in impacts to resources except for ferrous resources and right-of-way. Impacts to vegetation and wetlands were determined to be similar regardless of where the final alignment would be oriented within the widened area (see Chapter 4: Community and Social Analysis and Chapter 5: Physical and Environmental Analysis for more details). To calculate potential impacts without overestimating them due to the widened area of evaluation, a corridor averaging 200-400 feet wide was assumed for Alternative E-1A within the area of evaluation. 2.3.5 Alternative E-2 Alternative E-2 is routed around the UTAC permit to mine and environmental setting boundaries. The following details for this alternative have been refined since Scoping based on considerations of crossing the Rouchleau Pit, structural vs. fill options, bridge design in blasting zone, depth of pit, lands permitted or leased for mine operations, and construction staging considerations.13 ■ New Alignment From south to north, Alternative E-2 generally follows existing US 53 from the Midway area to the MN 135 exit ramp for the start of new four-lane construction. As shown in Figure 2.1-6, the new alignment then continues on a northeasterly track on the present day Landfill Road corridor before turning to the west to cross over the Rouchleau Pit. Upon crossing the pit, Alternative E-2 turns to the southwest following an abandoned railroad corridor that runs between the pit and residential neighborhoods before reconnecting to existing US 53 at 2nd Avenue. Areas of roadway that would be removed are shown in Figure 2.3-6. Two alignments are being considered for Alternative E-2 between Midway and roughly MN 135.14 Both options extend from a point just north of Cuyuna Drive on the south end to approximately the point where the Mesabi Trail crosses existing Landfill Road just north of the MN 135. ■ Straight Option: This is a westerly route that follows existing US 53 and the exit ramp to MN 135. This option minimizes new disturbance by following existing roads to the extent possible. The area of evaluation for this option includes a wider section just south of MN 135 to allow for design flexibility to shift the alignment east of the existing easement agreement area, if needed, to minimize mining setback and wetland impacts. ■ Curved Setback Option: This route shifts east of existing US 53, similar to the alignment of Alternative E-1A south of MN 135. The purpose of this option is to facilitate staging of project construction and to minimize or potentially avoid encroachment on the mine setback from the road, shifting the alignment to the east at least 300 feet. The actual alignment shift exceeds 300 feet to also minimize impacts to the wetland that is located between US 53 and this option. ■ Local Access The 2nd Avenue access would be converted from the existing partial interchange to an at-grade intersection. The existing 2nd Avenue interchange does not allow for turns from southbound US 53 to 2nd Avenue or from 2nd Avenue to northbound US 53. The new 2nd Avenue intersection would provide access to and from US 53 in all directions. Both intersections would be signalized (intersection geometry shown in Figure 3.1-5). There are two intersection options evaluated for MN 135 at US 53. ■ Intersection Option: With this option, as shown in Figure 2.3-7, MN 135 would be slightly realigned to accommodate a new at-grade intersection with US 53, replacing the existing interchange. An unsignalized, ¾ intersection would be used at the US 53/MN 135 intersection, with no left turns allowed from westbound MN 135 to US 53 (intersection geometry shown in Figure 3.1-5). 13 Alignment development details are further described in the Alternatives Development Report in Appendix K. Permitted and leased mining operations are defined in Section 4.2. 14 The Alternative E-2 Curved Setback Option was developed after the completion of the Alternatives Development Report and, therefore, is not discussed in that document. ■ Interchange Option: With this option, a compressed diamond interchange would be constructed to provide full access between US 53 and MN 135, as shown in Figure 2.3-7. Access to Landfill Road would be maintained with a new at-grade connection approximately one-half mile north of the new US 53/MN 135 intersection. A median break in the US 53 corridor would allow for access to Landfill Road for travelers from both directions on US 53. ■ Design Features A constrained highway cross section between the new Landfill Road access and 2nd Avenue, approximately one mile (5,500 feet) long, was assumed in order to reduce the potential impacts of the Alternative E-2 route along the west side of and across the Rouchleau Pit. The constrained cross section assumed median and outside barriers and steep side slopes (Figure 2.3-3). East of the Rouchleau Pit a continuation of the existing cross section from the south is planned. The new Landfill Road access median break was assumed to be located outside of the constrained cross section. The US 53 median at Landfill Road would provide a refuge for vehicles making turning movements across US 53 at Landfill Road. The most feasible pit crossing method for this alternative was determined to be a bridge; a fill option was eliminated based on constructability issues. A fill section across the pit is not expected to be feasible due to the depth of the water and pit and the width of the fill footprint at this location. At 1:2 slopes the fill footprint at the bottom of the fill would be at least 950 feet wide and require nearly 10 million cubic yards of fill material; with more reasonable slopes of 1:4, the footprint and fill material needed would double. Additionally, given the depth of water to be contained on the north side of the fill (125 feet currently), the fill would require engineering for a dam to support the water pressure as well as blasting vibration. The dam design would also need to consider future water level fluctuations as dewatering changes occur. Given the extent of constructability concerns and costs compared to a bridge, the fill option was dropped from further consideration for this alternative. Therefore, a bridge would be used to cross the Rouchleau Pit. The pit is approximately 250 feet deep at the crossing location, and the bridge would span approximately 1,350 feet. Crossing primarily on structure would minimize potential fill quantity and stability concerns. This alternative must consider design criteria to withstand blasting operations in the adjacent mine. Constructability assessments have indicated that a bridge crossing of the pit represents comparable constructability issues and cost impacts as other alternatives. This alternative was found in the SD/Draft SDD (February 2012) to meet all four need criteria. ■ Area of Evaluation The potential physical impacts from this alternative were evaluated for the area shown in Figure 2.1-6. Physical impacts can be defined as areas where ground disturbance is likely to occur under one or more construction option. As noted above, this alternative includes a bridge crossing over the Rouchleau Pit. The area of evaluation was widened across the Rouchleau Pit for Alternative E-2 in areas where there is potential for design adjustments in the alignment to accommodate currently undefined solutions to known engineering challenges (e.g., existing areas of unstable fill and bridge type). The intent of evaluating the wider area was to identify potential impacts and determine if there were any environmental resources that could limit implementation of the design options being considered. As determined by analysis of aerial photography and data collection within the widened area of evaluation near the Rouchleau Pit, it generally has consistent vegetation/cover types (i.e., mostly forested with some wetlands, or rock pit walls and water) and has no existing development or noise receptors. Since most of the widened area is within the previously mined area in and adjacent to the Rouchleau Pit, the alignment adjustments should result in little difference in impacts to resources except for ferrous resources and right-of-way. Impacts to vegetation and wetlands were determined to be similar regardless of where the final alignment would be oriented within the widened area (see Chapter 4: Community and Social Analysis and Chapter 5: Physical and Environmental Analysis for more details). To calculate potential impacts without overestimating them due to the widened area of evaluation, a corridor averaging 150-300 feet wide was assumed for Alternative E-2 within the area of evaluation. 2.4 Selection of a Preferred Alternative Based on a variety of construction, cost, environmental, social, and economic factors, including mining operations and effects to the local economy, MnDOT has identified a preferred alternative. The reasoning used in selecting this alternative is described below. See Chapter 8: Consultation and Coordination for more information on agency and stakeholder involvement in the selection process. 2.4.1 Preferred Alternative Alternative E-2 includes a 1,300-foot long bridge with 180-foot or taller bridge piers within the Rouchleau Pit. It is recommended as the preferred alternative based on its ability to meet the project Purpose and Need and minimize impacts to social, economic, and environmental resources, and on the basis of a number of technical and cost considerations, as described below. Both the Straight Option and Curved Setback Option are being carried forward with the preferred alternative for further refinement; however, one will be identified as the selected option in the Final EIS based on public and agency comment, refinement of the design, and overall environmental impacts. The Interchange Option was selected for the preferred alternative over the Intersection Option. These options have similar social and environmental impacts; however, the Interchange Option would maintain the current access provided at US 53 and MN 135 and would provide safer approach grades from the east (two percent compared to six percent with an intersection). This reduction in grade would also reduce the earthwork and rock cut quantities required for construction. Benefits of the preferred alternative include: ■ Mineral Rights: Avoids the permit to mine/environmental setting boundary ■ Business Risks: Has no risk for air quality compliance to impact mine operations ■ Water Supply: Avoids the major dewatering that would be required for the Alternative E-1 RSS Option ■ Wetlands: Both the Straight and Curved Setback Options have fewer wetland impacts than Alternative E-1A (RSS or Bridge Option). The Straight Option has fewer wetland impacts than Alternative M-1 and the Curved Setback Options has wetland impacts similar to Alternative M-1. ■ Noise: A noise wall is preliminarily cost effective at affected residential locations ■ Right-of-Way: Impacts the fewest number of parcels of any Build Alternative ■ Engineering and Constructability Considerations: ■ Shorter bridge than the Alternative E-1A Bridge Option ■ Only two pier foundations required, compared to up to eight for the Alternative E-1A Bridge Option ■ Less work required to construct in the water/ice of the Rouchleau Pit ■ Avoids 40 mph curve needed for Alternative E-1A ■ Has a better sight distance northbound from the bridge to the 2nd Avenue traffic signal than Alternative E-1A ■ Piers to be constructed in less than 30 feet of mine waste fill as compared to Alternative E-1A that would have up to 100 feet of mine waste fill ■ Schedule: Has the least schedule risk due to engineering constructability considerations noted above as well as considerations related to owner and operator property interests ■ Cost: Costs significantly less than the Existing US 53 Alternative and Alternative M-1, and the upper range of the cost estimate is less than that for either the Alternative E-1A RSS Option or Bridge Option The negative effects of this alternative include: ■ Mineral Rights: More mineral encumbrance than Alternative E-1A; requires greater impact to School Trust land and, therefore, has potential for greater impact to Vermillion Gold, Inc.’s lease than Alternative E-1A ■ Section 4(f): Impacts the OHVRA; however, the impact is negligible and meets the definition of de minimis ■ Vegetation/Cover Types: Impacts more acres of forest than other alternatives; however, impacts to wildlife are negligible ■ Unknowns: Requires additional geotechnical characterization at pier locations 2.4.2 Other Alternatives Considered See Section 10.3.2 for more discussion on the rationale for rejecting the following alternatives. 2.4.2.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) The No Build Alternative was carried forward for analysis as the “do nothing alternative” because it was required for comparison to other alternatives. It is not identified as the preferred alternative since other Build Alternatives (i.e., M-1, E-1A, and E-2) would meet all of the identified project needs with less severe social, economic, and environmental impacts. 2.4.2.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) The Existing US 53 Alternative would have substantially greater uncertainty and cost than any of the Build Alternatives; therefore, it was not selected as the preferred alternative. 2.4.2.3 Alternative M-1 Alternative M-1 has feasibility issues and would result in severe negative impacts that are not offset by the benefits in minimization; therefore, it was not identified as the preferred alternative. 2.4.2.4 Alternative E-1A RSS Option The Alternative E-1A RSS Option has feasibility issues and would result in severe schedule and constructability impacts (i.e., it is unlikely to meet the timeline due to dewatering, with substantial risks for additional delays due to weather, mine waste fill, and design requirements to mitigate constructability concerns) that are not offset by the benefits in minimization of environmental impacts; therefore, it was not identified as the preferred alternative. Bridge Option The Alternative E-1A Bridge Option has feasibility issues and would result in severe negative schedule impacts (i.e., it would require the greatest construction effort to meet the timeline, with substantial risks for delays due to weather, mine waste fill, and design requirements to mitigate constructability concerns) that are not offset by the benefits in minimization of environmental impacts; therefore, it was not identified as the preferred alternative. EASTERNCORRIDOR Virginia 53£¤ 169 MIDDLE Mountain Iron CORRIDOR 135 Gilbert £¤ 467 Leonidas 57 37 Eveleth U101 V 53 £¤ WESTERNCORRIDOR Iron Junction 37 December 2014 ± 0 5,000 10,000 Feet Figure 2.1-1 Studied Corridors US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Draft Environmental Impact Statement £¤ 169 53 MOUNTAIN Alternative M-1 IRON Alternative M-2 £¤ VIRGINIA Alternative E-4 Alternative E-3 Alternative E-2 Alternative E-1 135 GILBERT £¤ 46 LEONI 5 DAS 7 7101EVELETH UV Alternative W-4 Alternative W-2 53 IRONJUNCTION  Alternative W-3  Alternative W-1  37  December 2014 ±0 3,000 6,000 Feet Source: Environmental Setting Boundary (DNR) Legend Figure 2.1-2 2012 Scoping Document Alternatives 2012 Scoping Document Alternatives UTAC Environmental Setting Boundary US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Municipalities Draft Environmental Impact Statement VIRGINIA £¤ 169 53 MOUNTAIN IRON 135 £¤ GILBERT 37 46 LEONI 5 DAS 7 7£¤ EVELETH 101UV 53 IRONJUNCTION 37 December 2014 ±0 3,000 6,000 Feet LegendExisting US 53 Easement Agreement Area Figure 2.1-3 No Build Alternative No Build Alternative Biwabik Iron Formation US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Municipalities Draft Environmental Impact Statement 750 1,500 Feet ± 0 Source: USGS Aerial 2011 LegendExisting US 53 Alternative Figure 2.1-4 Existing US 53 Easement Agreement Area Existing US 53 Alternative Existing Mesabi Trail US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Existing School Trust Land Draft Environmental Impact Statement 750 1,500 Feet ±0 Source: USGS Aerial 2011 Legend Figure 2.1-5 Existing Public Recreation Land Alternative M-1 Area of Evaluation Alternative M-1 Existing US 53 Easement Existing School Trust Land Agreement Area US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Existing Mesabi Trail Draft Environmental Impact Statement Note: A 150-300 foot wide corridor was assumed for impact calculations reported in the Draft EIS. 750 1,500 Feet ±0 Source: USGS Aerial 2011 Legend Alternative E-2 Area of Evaluation Existing Mesabi Trail Existing US 53 Easement Existing Public Recreation Land Agreement Area Existing School Trust Land Figure 2.1-6 Alternative E-2 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Draft Environmental Impact Statement Note: A 200-400 foot wide corridor was assumed for impact calculations reported in the Draft EIS. 750 1,500 Feet ±0 Source: USGS Aerial 2011 Legend Alternative E-1AArea of Evaluation Existing Mesabi Trail Existing US 53 Easement Existing Public Recreation Land Agreement Area Existing School Trust Land Figure 2.2-1 Alternative E-1A US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Draft Environmental Impact Statement ±0 3,000 6,000 Feet Source: Environmental Setting Boundary (DNR) Legend Figure 2.3-1 No Build Alternative Alternative E-2 Existing US 53 Alternative UTAC Environmental Setting Boundary All Alternatives Municipalities US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Alternative E-1A Alternative M-1 Draft Environmental Impact Statement 2nd Ave Connection via Southern Drive Intersection MN 135 Connection Source: MnDOT Aerial 2011 Figure 2.3-2 Alternative M-1 Legend Local Street Connections Alternative M-1 0 250 500 Feet US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Road Removed Draft Environmental Impact Statement ±    INPLACE US 53 TYPICAL SECTIONUS 53 - CONSTRAINED    TYPICAL SECTION    December 2014 Figure 2.3-3 Existing and Constrained Typical Sections US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Draft Environmental Impact Statement Source: SEH Layout 11/27/20122nd Ave W 6th Ave W Southern Dr £SOUTHSIDE PARK NEW 2ND AVENUEAT-GRADE INTERSECTION 53¤ ROUCHLEAU PIT INTERCHANGEREMOVED 2nd Ave Connection NEW MN 135 AT-GRADE INTERSECTION (INTERSECTION OPTION) Note: See Figure 2.3-5 for the Interchange Option INTERCHANGEREMOVED 135 December 2014 £53¤ MN 135 Connection Source: MnDOT Aerial 2011 Figure 2.3-4 Legend Alternative E-1A Alternative E-1A Local Street Connections Existing Mesabi Trail 0 250 500 Feet US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth ± Draft Environmental Impact Statement Road Removals Intersection Option December 2014 Interchange Option 300 600 Feet ±0 Figure 2.3-5 Alternative E-1A Intersection and Interchange Options US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Draft Environmental Impact Statement 2nd Ave W 6th Ave W SOUTHSIDE PARK £ROUCHLEAU PIT 53¤ Southern Dr NEW 2ND AVENUEAT-GRADE INTERSECTION INTERCHANGEREMOVED 2nd Ave Connection Note: The Alternative E-2 Straight Option is shown.

The Existing US 53 Alternative would maintain the existing highway corridor and, therefore, is the “baseline” for analysis comparison in this chapter. This chapter also identifies modes of transportation other than motor vehicles that are present within the study area (see Figure 3.1-1) and compares how each would be affected by the alternatives. 3.1 Traffic Forecast and Capacity Analysis 3.1.1 Traffic Volumes Study area traffic volumes for the existing US 53 connection (2009) and forecasted years 2017 (project completion) and 2037 (20 years after completion) are shown in Figure 3.1-1. Growth in traffic is expected throughout the study area with increases for US 53 and adjacent roadways at about one percent per year. For details of the analysis, refer to the Traffic Analysis Technical Report (CH2M Hill, 2013).2 3.1.1.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) Traffic volumes are expected to change under the No Build Alternative. Closure of the US 53 easement segment would result in the official rerouting of US 53 along existing MN 37, Co. 7, and US169 (Figure 3.1-2). It was also assumed that local traffic would use Co. 101 as a shortcut, at least up through 2024, at which time the mine has indicated potential closure of Co. 101 to through traffic.3 Estimated daily traffic volumes on US 53 under the No Build Alternative are shown on Figure 3.1-3. These estimates are based on peak hour field counts (May 2012) collected at US 53 interchanges of MN 37 and MN 135, along with expected travel pattern shifts due to the road closure. It was assumed that approximately 10 percent of daily traffic that would have used the US 53 easement would use routes outside of the study area, based on local understanding of the regional roadway network and availability of other potential travel routes. It is expected that local traffic between Gilbert and Virginia would not use the designated No Build Alternative route but would instead use MN 37 (between Gilbert and Eveleth) and Co. 101 (while it remains open) to access Co. 7.4 Removal of the US 53 easement segment from the area’s transportation network is projected to result in substantial shifts in traffic volumes onto the surrounding highways in future years 2017 and 2037. Notable changes include large decreases along existing US 53 south of Virginia, as well as adjacent to the Midway neighborhood and Eveleth; large increases in traffic volumes along the designated US 53 reroute; and large increases in traffic volumes along the segment of MN 37 (between Gilbert and Eveleth) and Co. 101. 1 Available at http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/TechnicalReports.html 2 Available at http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/TechnicalReports.html 3 A segment of Co. 101 is located on an easement through UTAC’s environmental setting boundary. Per the Co. 101 agreement terms, UTAC can revoke the easement to the County at any time. 4 See page 2 of the Traffic Analysis Technical Report (CH2M Hill, 2013) and the Highway 53 Relocation Economic Impact Study (McComb Group and SEH, 2014) for more details. 3.1.1.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) This alternative represents the existing condition. The Existing US 53 Alternative does not change traffic volumes as it causes no change in traffic conditions. 3.1.1.3 Build Alternatives Daily traffic volumes for the Build Alternatives are expected to be similar to the traffic volumes on the existing easement segment, shown on Figure 3.1-1. Peak hour turning volumes at the intersections of 2nd Avenue and MN 135, both of which are key, at-grade intersections included in all three Build Alternatives (see Figures 3.1-4 and 3.1-5), were estimated using a combination of the field counts collected in May 2012, Automatic Traffic Recorder data on US 53, and daily traffic volumes. For more information on peak hour turning volumes, see the Traffic Analysis Technical Report (CH2M Hill, 2013). An at-grade intersection at US 53 and 2nd Avenue would increase access to US 53 over what is currently provided by the partial interchange at this location. Specifically, access to northbound US 53 from 2nd Avenue and to 2nd Avenue from southbound US 53 are movements that are not currently provided but would be provided with an at-grade intersection. Under Alternative M-1, new access to US 53 would be provided for Southern Drive. Under Alternative M-1 and the Alternative E-1A and E-2 Intersection Options, an at-grade intersection at US 53 and MN 135 would modify the access provided by the current full interchange (Figures 3.1-4 and 3.1-5). The current interchange provides free-flowing access for all movements between MN 135 and US 53.Alternative M-1 (with signal) would maintain full access, and the Alternative E-1A and E-2 Intersection Options (without signal) would involve a ¾ intersection with no left turns allowed from westbound MN 135 to southbound US 53. The Interchange Option under Alternatives E-1A and E-2 would provide free-flowing access for all movements between MN 135 and US 53 as is provided under existing conditions (see Figures 2.3-5 and 2.3-7). Maintenance of existing access at US 53 and MN 135 has been strongly supported by the public. 3.1.2 Traffic Operations Roadway operations were estimated using a Level of Service (LOS) measure that is based on the amount of congestion experienced by motorists. Congestion is rated from A to F, with LOS A representing free flow with no congestion and LOS F representing high levels of congestion with very long delays and slow speeds. The LOS D/LOS E boundary was used as the US 53 performance measure for LOS. A planning level review of capacity, including assumptions based on the Highway Capacity Manual and the Minnesota Department of Transportation’s (MnDOT’s) Automatic Traffic Recorder data, was used to calculate LOS for the segments of US 53 listed in Table 3.1-1 for year of construction (2017) and future 20 year conditions (2037). Review of these volumes versus the expected capacity of a four-lane divided roadway with turn lanes (approximately 35,000 ADT with LOS D or better) shows that this configuration provides adequate capacity for existing and future traffic volumes on US 53. 3.1.2.1 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) This alternative represents the existing condition. The Existing US 53 Alternative maintains the existing roadway geometry, and, therefore, it does not change traffic operations or cause changes in traffic conditions. The existing highway would continue to operate adequately under future traffic volumes, as shown in Table 3.1-1. Table 3.1-1.

Because the No Build Alternative roads are largely two-lane rural roads, this assessment was done to determine if existing configurations could accommodate rerouted US 53 traffic volumes. Table 3.1-2 summarizes the results, including traffic volumes in years 2009, 2017, and 2037; roadway geometry; and corresponding LOS. MN 37, Co. 7, Co. 101, and US 169 all currently operate at acceptable LOS with existing traffic volumes. However, four of the segments would operate at LOS E/F, which indicates high levels of congestion, in both 2017 and 2037 under the No Build Alternative where US 53 traffic would be introduced and no capacity would be added to these highways. Table 3.1-2.

It is assumed that Alternatives M-1, E-1A, and E-2, all of which are four-lane roadways, would also provide acceptable LOS. One key difference between existing conditions and Alternatives M-1, E-1A, and E-2 is the intersections of US 53 with MN 135 and 2nd Avenue. It was assumed that the existing interchange at 2nd Avenue would not be retained under the Build Alternatives; rather, an at-grade intersection would replace the existing interchange (see Figures 3.1-4 and 3.1-5). For Alternatives E-1A and E-2, at MN 135 both unsignalized and signalized at-grade intersection options (Intersection Option) and a grade-separated compressed diamond interchange option (Interchange Option) were addressed in the analysis. An operational analysis using Synchro modeling software was conducted to determine whether estimated traffic volumes would be accommodated by at-grade intersections at 2nd Avenue and MN 135. Based on a planning level review of changes to local travel patterns and Synchro analysis results, a signalized intersection was assumed at 2nd Avenue for all Build Alternatives (Traffic Analysis Technical Report, CH2M Hill, 2013). The 2nd Avenue intersection would meet warrants for installation of a traffic signal in the build year (2017). Operations at the US 53 and 2nd Avenue intersection vary by alternative. Alternatives E-1A and E-2 would have a three-legged intersection,5 whereas Alternative M-1 would have a four-legged intersection that also provides access to Southern Drive (Figures 3.1-4 and 3.1-5). Replacing the existing interchange with an at-grade intersection would also introduce two movements that do not currently exist (access to northbound US 53 from 2nd Avenue and access to northbound 2nd Avenue from southbound US 53). A sensitivity analysis completed for this intersection found that operations are acceptable until peak hour turning movement volumes reach 600 vehicles. At this volume, the intersection would operate at LOS C, with some movements experiencing LOS F. Higher levels of turns may require dual left turn lanes for southbound US 53. The preliminary design of the intersection allows for a future addition of a second left turn lane. The LOS for the intersection of 2nd Avenue and US 53 with 600 turning vehicles in the peak hours in future year 2037 with a dual left turn lane would be LOS D. ■ Intersection and Interchange Options At US 53 and MN 135, both an intersection (under Alternative M-1, Alternative E-1A Intersection Option, and Alternative E-2 Intersection Option) and an interchange (Alternative E-1A Interchange Option and Alternative E-2 Interchange Option) would result in an acceptable LOS, both at project opening (2017) and in the future design year (2037) (Table 3.1-3). The intersection is anticipated to operate at LOS B with an at-grade signal and with an at-grade, non-signalized, restricted crossing U-turn (RCUT) intersection.6A compresseddiamond interchange configuration would alsooperate at acceptable LOS (LOS A or LOS B) at the ramp terminal intersections (see Table 3.1-3). 5 A three-legged intersection is an intersection with three approaches. 6 An RCUT intersection restricts left turns within an intersection, requiring traffic to make a U-turn farther downstream. In this case, southbound left-turning vehicles on MN 135 would make a right turn (northbound) then a U-turn farther north on US 53. Table 3.1-3.

B An interchange option is not feasible for Alternative M-1. The levels of service for the compressed diamond interchange at MN 135 only apply to Alternatives E-1A and E-2. The Synchro model used to evaluate the intersection operations does not account for the grade differences of the road between these options, or the potential increase in truck volumes anticipated through this intersection. With an interchange, the east approach would be at a two percent grade; with an intersection, the grade would be six percent or more. A steeper grade increases the difficulty of loaded semi-trucks turning left onto MN 135 in the winter (November to April). 3.1.3 Travel Times Travel times for existing conditions and the alternatives were calculated based on the posted speed limits for all routes. Potential delays due to congestion or rail crossings were not accounted for in the calculations. For the No Build Alternative, there is potential for up to five additional minutes of delay due to three at-grade railroad crossings (see Section 3.2.1.3). Travel times for the four scenarios listed below were developed. ■ Regional Travel (Table 3.1-4): travel time from just south of the southern MN 37 interchange to 18th Street north of Virginia via US 53 (via MN 37/Co.7 for the No Build Alternative) ■ Eveleth to Virginia (Table 3.1-5): travel time to/from the intersection of Grant Avenue (Co. 302) and Pierce Street in Eveleth to Chestnut Street and 4th Avenue in downtown Virginia ■ Gilbert to Virginia (Table 3.1-6): travel time to/from the intersection of MN 37 and MN 135 in Gilbert to the intersection of Chestnut Street and 4th Avenue in downtown Virginia ■ Interregional Travel: travel time from Duluth to International Falls via US 53 (via MN 37/Co.7 for the No Build Alternative) Table 3.1-4.

Using delays reported in the detailed intersection analysis, the average delay for through traffic on US 53 due to the addition of a signalized intersection, depending on the direction and time of day, ranges from one to two minutes in the 2037 peak hours. Under the No Build Alternative, inter-regional travel times would increase six to 21 minutes. Considering the total inter-regional corridor between Duluth and International Falls is 163 miles, around three hours if a 55 mph average is used, the worst-case incremental increase in delay represents a one percent increase in total inter-regional travel time for the Build Alternatives and a 12 percent increase in total travel time for the No Build Alternative. 3.1.3.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) Travel distances and travel times would more than double under the No Build Alternative from Virginia to either Eveleth or Gilbert compared to existing conditions. Local travel time increases range from 6.5 to 21.2 minutes. This would negatively impact the connectivity of the Quad Cities. 3.1.3.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) Travel distances and travel times would not change compared to existing conditions under this alternative. 3.1.3.3 Build Alternatives Travel times on Alternatives M-1, E-1A, and E-2 would generally be slightly higher than travel times today on US 53 due to delay at the additional signalized intersection(s) at MN 135 (Alternative M-1 only) and 2nd Avenue and due to minor increases in distance (Alternatives E1A and E-2); however, this delay would not be substantial (approximately one to three minutes). However, the delay for left-turning vehicles turning to/from MN 135 would experience much greater delays with the unsignalized Intersection Option (under Alternative E-1A or E-2) than with the existing or proposed Interchange Option. 3.1.4 Safety Five years of crash records (from 2007-2011) for US 53 between south MN 37 interchange (to/from the west) and the US 169 interchange were used to complete a safety analysis. Out of the three segments within the corridor, two had less than the average crash rates for comparable four-lane divided rural highways. One segment, US 53 between the north MN 37 interchange (to/from the east) and 12th Avenue, did experience a crash rate higher than the critical crash rate over the five-year study period. Review of the crash data suggests that the corridor experienced a higher than expected amount of snow/slush related crashes. MnDOT previously implemented safety strategies to counter the crashes, including a changeable message sign installed in the late 1990s, to warn of icy conditions. Crash records for MN 37, MN 135, US 169, Co. 7, and Co. 101 were also analyzed. In general, both existing MN 37 and MN 135 include segments that have rates that are higher than would be expected for similar two-lane rural and urban roadway types. Specific issues identified in these corridors from the MnDOT Traffic Safety Fundamentals Handbook (2008, page A-20) include: ■ For the rural segments of MN 135 and MN 37, run off the road crashes are the most common type of crash with 35 percent and 45 percent of the crashes, respectively. The state average crash rate for similar two-lane rural roadways is 31 percent. ■ For the urban segment of MN 37 in Gilbert, the majority of the crashes (64 percent) are intersection related with right angle crashes making up 41 percent of the crashes. The state average crash rate for similar two-lane urban roadways is 21 percent. 3.1.4.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) Future safety issues along existing US 53 south of Virginia are not anticipated given that traffic volumes along this roadway are anticipated to substantially decrease with the No Build Alternative. However, the segments of MN 37, MN 135, Co. 7, and Co. 101 that would either compose the rerouted US 53 under the No Build Alternative or be adjacent to these roads all currently have crash rates that are higher than state average crash rates for similar two-lane roadways. The increases in traffic volumes that are several magnitudes higher (see volumes in Table 3.1-2) than existing traffic volumes indicate that these safety issues would worsen under the No Build Alternative. The introduction of these higher traffic volumes would also raise highway safety concerns at three at-grade railroad crossings along the No Build Alternative route (one crossing on MN 37 and two crossings on Co. 7). 3.1.4.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) The existing US 53 corridor from MN 37 (East) to 12th Avenue experienced a higher than expected number of crashes during snowy or icy conditions in the past five years and is the basis of comparison for other alternatives. Current safety issues would not change under the Existing US 53 Alternative. MnDOT would continue implementation of its weather-related safety changeable message signs. 3.1.4.3 Build Alternatives The existing US 53 corridor from MN 37 (East) to 12th Avenue experienced a higher than expected number of crashes during snowy or icy conditions in 2007 to 2011. Under the Build Alternatives, traffic volumes and road capacity would not change. MnDOT would continue implementation of its weather-related safety changeable message signs. ■ Intersection and Interchange Options For Alternatives E-1A and E-2, the at-grade Intersection Option and the compressed diamond Interchange Option at MN 135 and US 53 were compared using the Highway Safety Manual (HSM). The results for existing traffic volumes and forecast volumes for 2017 and 2037 showed virtually no difference in crash rates (see Table 3.1-7). Table 3.1-7. Intersection and Interchange Crash Rate Comparison Traffic Volume Year  Intersection Option (total crashes per year)  Interchange Option (total crashes per year)  2009  4.6  4.6  2017  5.1  5.0  2037  6.1  6.1  While the results were essentially the same between the Intersection Option and Interchange Option at the level of the HSM analysis for the years 2009, 2017, and 2037, this analysis does not account for the grade difference for the east approach between these options. The Intersection Option would require a much steeper grade (six percent compared to two percent for the Interchange Option) at the east approach, which would be expected to result in increased difficulty for loaded semi-trucks turning left onto US 53 in the winter (November to April). This difficulty would increase the potential for semi-truck/vehicle conflict at the intersection, which would increase crash risk and result in the intersection being the less desirable option based on safety. 3.1.5 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures For the Existing US 53 and Build Alternatives, there would be no adverse effects on traffic volumes, traffic operations, travel times, or safety; therefore, no mitigation is proposed. The No Build Alternative would adversely affect traffic volumes, traffic operations, travel times, and safety; however, by definition, the No Build Alternative would not include any mitigation measures. 3.2  Intermodal Transportation  3.2.1  Existing Conditions  3.2.1.1  Bicycles and Pedestrians  Virginia’s Comprehensive Plan (December 1997) notes that the city has a substantial sidewalk system that accommodates pedestrians but lacks a similarly developed system for bicyclists. The Mesabi Trail, a shared use path, runs through the cities of Virginia and Gilbert (Figure 4.3-1 in Section 4.3). This 115-mile trail connects more than 25 communities in northern Minnesota from Ely to Grand Rapids. Within the study area, the trail parallels the US 53 easement segment and continues along the west side of the Rouchleau Pit. 3.2.1.2 Bus Transit Arrowhead Transit, operated by the Arrowhead Economic Opportunity Agency (AEOA), provides scheduled bus service and Dial-A-Ride service in St. Louis County, including the city of Virginia. Scheduled public transit service is provided on weekdays, including service within Virginia and from Virginia to the cities of Babbit, Buhl, Chisholm, Duluth, Eveleth, Hibbing, and West Eveleth. According to the AEOA bus service schedule, there are two main routes which use the US 53 easement agreement segment daily from Monday through Friday. This includes five daily round trips between Eveleth and Virginia (2nd Ave ramp to/from Eveleth) and five daily round trips between Gilbert/Aurora and Virginia (MN 135 to/from the 2nd Ave ramp), resulting in 20 trips per day using this segment of US 53. Arrowhead Transit’s Dial-A-Ride service provides shared-ride, curb-to-curb transit within Virginia. There are no eligibility restrictions for these services. Rural Rides, which is not provided by Arrowhead Transit, provides work-related transportation services for low-income individuals in St. Louis County. Income guidelines apply for most of these services. 3.2.1.3 Rail Railroad corridors owned by Canadian National (CN) and operated by its subsidiary Wisconsin Central are located in the vicinity of the No Build Alternative and cross existing roadways at three locations (one crossing on MN 37 and two crossings on Co. 7) (Figure 3.1-1). The at-grade railroad crossing on MN 37 is a main rail line with an average of 17 trains per day carrying approximately 136,000 tons per day (Minnesota Comprehensive Statewide Freight and Passenger Rail Plan, 2010). The other two crossings on Co. 7 are mine service lines, with eight trains per day at the crossing between MN 37 and Co. 101 and 11 trains at the rail crossing at the intersection of Co. 7 and Co. 101. Future growth is not anticipated on the rail lines that cross Co. 7 but is anticipated on the main rail line crossing MN 37 (Minnesota Comprehensive Statewide Freight and Passenger Rail Plan, 2010). With an expected growth of three percent per year in tonnage there would be an increase to 22 trains daily by 2017 and 39 trains by 2037. 3.2.1.4 Aviation The publicly owned Eveleth-Virginia Airport is located approximately two miles southeast of Eveleth, just east of Co. 132 (Figure 1.0-1). This facility is owned and managed by a joint municipal commission with representatives from Eveleth and Virginia. The airport has two runways, one that is 4,200 feet long and one that is 2,550 feet long. The airport is located approximately five miles south of the project area, which means that the alternatives are outside of the area influenced by airport rules and regulations. This was verified through a check of the airport influence map for the Eveleth-Virginia Airport (January 1, 2010) that is available on MnDOT’s Aeronautics and Aviation webpage. 3.2.1.5 Other Transportation Modes Specialized modes of transportation, including school buses (from the Mountain Iron/Buhl, Eveleth, and Virginia school districts), ambulances (from Essentia Health-Virginia), and police and fire vehicles, all use the easement segment of US 53 to reach parts of the Quad Cities (see Section 4.7). 3.2.2 Intermodal Transportation Impacts This section describes potential impacts that would occur to the transportation modes described above as a result of implementing each alternative. This section does not address impacts to those traveling by personal vehicle or truck on US 53, as these modes have been covered in Section 3.1. Trail-related impacts are also covered in greater detail in Section 4.3. 3.2.2.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) ■ Bicycles and Pedestrians The No Build Alternative would not adversely affect current pedestrian/bicycle accommodations. MnDOT’s action of vacating the US 53 easement segment (just southwest of the Rouchleau Pit), through which the Mesabi Trail runs, would not directly impact the Mesabi Trail. Potential trail impacts due to actions by others are discussed in Chapter 7: Cumulative Impacts. The termination of the MnDOT easement by RGGS/UTAC does not directly affect the Mesabi Trail. ■ Bus Transit The lengthened routes and times for those traveling from Virginia to points outside the community would affect existing transit service, particularly the scheduled bus service between downtown Virginia and the Eveleth and Gilbert/Aurora areas, adding a minimum of 10 to 20 minutes, respectively, to each trip (see the travel times noted in Tables 3.1-5 and 3.1-6). ■ Rail Three existing at-grade rail crossings would be part of the designated reroute of US 53 under the No Build Alternative (one on MN 37 and two on Co. 7). The No Build Alternative would not affect train travel; however, increasing traffic volumes on MN 37/Co. 7 would increase the safety risk to travelers at these at-grade crossings. ■ Aviation The No Build Alternative would not directly impact the Eveleth-Virginia Airport located southeast of Eveleth. However, some airport users could be affected by increased travel times to/from the airport. ■ Other Transportation Modes The No Build Alternative would negatively impact the ability of school buses, ambulances, and police and fire vehicles to efficiently connect to all parts of the Quad Cities. Travel times between downtown Virginia and the Eveleth and Gilbert/Aurora areas would be substantially increased (10 to 20 minutes per Tables 3.2-5 and 3.2-6), resulting in corresponding increases in response times of police, fire, and ambulance vehicles along with other modes of transportation to/from these areas (see Section 4.7). 3.2.2.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) This alternative, in which US 53 would continue to operate as it does today, would not adversely affect any of the multimodal transportation options considered in this chapter. 3.2.2.3 Alternative M-1 ■ Bicycles and Pedestrians MnDOT’s action of vacating the US 53 easement segment (just southwest of the Rouchleau Pit), through which the Mesabi Trail runs, would not directly impact the Mesabi Trail. Potential trail impacts due to actions by others are discussed in Chapter 7: Cumulative Impacts. The termination of the MnDOT easement by RGGS/UTAC does not directly affect the Mesabi Trail. ■ Bus Transit While introducing shorter (0.8 miles) travel distance and travel times, Alternative M-1 would not noticeably change the travel times of the existing transit service that is offered within the study area. ■ Rail Existing railroad lines and crossings would not be impacted by Alternative M-1. ■ Aviation Alternative M-1 would not impact the Eveleth-Virginia Airport located southeast of Eveleth. ■ Other Transportation Modes Alternative M-1 would not noticeably affect the travel times of school buses or emergency service vehicles. 3.2.2.4 Alternative E-1A ■ Bicycles and Pedestrians MnDOT’s action of vacating the US 53 easement segment (just southwest of the Rouchleau Pit), through which the Mesabi Trail runs, would not directly impact the Mesabi Trail. Potential trail impacts by others are discussed in Chapter 7: Cumulative Impacts. The termination of the MnDOT easement by RGGS/UTAC does not directly affect the Mesabi Trail. The Alternative E-1A alignment crosses the existing Mesabi Trail at several locations. These crossings would be consolidated into one crossing location for user safety, or Alternative E-1A could allow for the Mesabi Trail to be reconstructed via permit on the eastern edge of the new alignment as part of the project but funded by the St. Louis and Lake Counties Regional Railroad Authority (SLLCRRA) (see Section 4.3 for more details). Potential trail impacts by others are discussed in Chapter 7: Cumulative Impacts. ■ Bus Transit While introducing slightly longer travel distance (approximately 1.3 to 1.5 miles) and travel times (approximately 2 to 3.5 minutes), Alternative E-1A would have a minor impact on the existing transit service that is offered within the study area. ■ Rail Existing railroad lines and crossings would not be impacted by Alternative E-1A. ■ Aviation Alternative E-1A would not impact the Eveleth-Virginia Airport located southeast of Eveleth (Figure 1.0-1) or substantially increase local travel time to/from the airport. ■ Other Transportation Modes Alternative E-1A would have a minor (approximately two to 3.5 minute) increase to the travel times of school buses or emergency service vehicles. 3.2.2.5 Alternative E-2 ■ Bicycles and Pedestrians MnDOT’s action of vacating the US 53 easement segment (just southwest of the Rouchleau Pit), through which the Mesabi Trail runs, would not directly impact the Mesabi Trail. Potential trail impacts by others are discussed in Chapter 7: Cumulative Impacts. The termination of the MnDOT easement by RGGS/UTAC does not directly affect the Mesabi Trail. Alternative E-2 would cross the Mesabi Trail at several locations. These crossings would be consolidated into one crossing location for user safety, or Alternative E-2 could include an easement along the eastern edge of the new alignment for the Mesabi Trail to be reconstructed as part of the project but funded by the St. Louis and Lake Counties Regional Railroad Authority (SLLCRRA) (see Section 4.3 for more details). Additional design details are needed to determine how the trail would be relocated. The final design will be discussed in the Final EIS. Potential trail impacts by others are discussed in Chapter 7: Cumulative Impacts. ■ Bus Transit While introducing slightly longer travel distance (approximately 1.3 to 1.5 miles) and travel times, Alternative E-2 would have a minor impact on the existing transit service that is offered within the study area. ■ Rail Existing railroad lines and crossings would not be impacted by Alternative E-2. ■ Aviation Alternative E-2 would not impact the Eveleth-Virginia Airport located southeast of Eveleth (Figure 1.0-1) or substantially increase local travel time to/from the airport. ■ Other Transportation Modes Alternative E-2 would have a minor (approximately two to 3.5 minutes) increase to the travel times of school buses or emergency service vehicles. 3.2.3 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures MnDOT would continue to use safety warning signs for all alternatives. The No Build Alternative would have substantial adverse impacts on railroad crossing safety; however, by definition, the No Build Alternative would not include any mitigation measures. December 2014 Figure 3.1-1ng and Forecast Traffic umes on US 53 2009 AADT Segment 2017 AADT 4-Lane Highway 2037 AADT Existi To Duluth Vol Source: Traffic Analysis Technical Report (2013)Stream 2-Lane Highway Railroad 0 0.5 1 Miles US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Draft Environmental Impact St t County / Local Road atemen To International Falls To International Falls December 2014 To Chisholm To Chisholm To Biwabik To Biwabik LegendTo Hibbing To Hibbing 4-Lane Highway 2-Lane Highway To Duluth To Duluth Railroad Lake Figure 3.1-2 0.5 1 Miles County / Local Road ± 0 Stream No Build Alternative Designated Reroute U.S. 53 Route US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Source: Traffic Analysis Technical Report (2013)Draft Environmental Impact Statement To International Falls Souther Drive 2,000* 15,000 28,200 29,600 December 2014 To Biwabik ± Figure 3.1-3 Representative Traffic Volumes 0 0.5 1 Miles for No Build Alternative US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Source: Traffic Analysis Technical Report (2013)*Volume reduction due to planned            closure of Co. 101 by year 2037 Draft Environmental Impact Statement Legend4-Lane Highway 2009 AADT 2017 AADT 2-Lane Highway 2037 AADT Railroad Lake County / Local Road Stream t ±Not to Scale 2nd Avenue Intersection December 2014 ± Not to Scale MN 135 Intersection Source: Traffic Analysis Technical Report (2013) Figure 3.1-4 Alternative M-1 Intersections US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Draft Environmental Impact Statement ±Not to Scale 2nd Avenue Intersection Note: See Figures 2.3-5 and 2.3-7 for Interchange Options ± Not to Scale MN 135 Intersection Source: Traffic Analysis Technical Report (2013) Figure 3.1-5 Alternative E-1A and E-2 Intersection Options US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Draft Environmental Impact Statement 4.0 Community and Social Analysis 4.1 Right-of-Way 4.1.1 Regulatory Context and Methodology 4.1.1.1 Regulatory Context Federal and State Law The Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act (Uniform Act) of 1970, and its amendments, provides federal requirements regarding the acquisition of right-of-way for any federally funded actions. The Uniform Act is adopted for all public acquisitions in Minnesota by Minnesota Statutes section 117.52. The purpose of this act is to ensure people whose real property is acquired, or who move as a result of projects receiving public funds, will be treated fairly and equitably. The longevity of any alternative, which is the expected lifespan of infrastructure to be built, is also guided by federal policy. Applicable federal regulations and advisories are found at 23 CFR 710 (Right-of-Way and Real Estate) with reference to 49 CFR 24 Subpart B (Real Property Acquisition) and at 23 CFR 626 (General Pavement Design Considerations). These regulations include guidance regarding cost-effective public investments for highway rights-of-way and infrastructure. The right-of-way acquired for the project will be a permanent solution (see definition below) commensurate with the transportation investment. Minnesota Statutes (sections 117 and 160) provide the legal authority to acquire right-of-way through direct purchase or condemnation. Right-of-Way Definitions There are a number of ways that right-of-way can be established. In an effort to minimize confusion in terminology, the following definitions for methods of establishing right-of-way were considered in this evaluation. ■ Permanent Solution: The permanent acquisition (greater than 99 years) of property rights for transportation use. Acquisition can be accomplished via a number of means as defined below. If the solution involves an easement, the agreement would require the easement owner to be responsible for any future road/infrastructure relocation. If the solution involves a permit for use within the easement by a third party (e.g., for a trail), the permitee would be responsible for relocating their infrastructure per the terms of the permit and underlying easement. ■ Fee Acquisition: Surface and/or mineral ownership is transferred to the buyer ■ Permanent Easement: An agreement giving a designated party other than the landowner the right to use the property for a specific purpose in perpetuity ■ Long-Term Easement: A time-limited agreement giving a designated party other than the landowner the right to use the property for a specific purpose, for a specific time period as outlined in the agreement (i.e., greater than 99 years) ■ Surface Rights ■ Total Acquisition: The entire property is acquired, excluding mineral rights ■ Partial Acquisition: Only a portion of the property is acquired with the remainder of the property staying with the owner ■ Easement Agreement: An agreement between the owner and the easement holder that defines the rights granted by the easement. The easement agreement may include terms to address compensation, duration, notice for performing work in the easement area, or other terms that articulate how the owner and easement holder interact. ■ Mineral Rights ■ Mineral rights can be owned separately from rights for the surface of land. In Minnesota law, this is known as a “severance” of surface and mineral rights associated with a property. Severance of mineral rights usually occurs through a sale of land rights which specifically states in the deed of conveyance the specific mineral rights retained by the seller. Once severed, mineral rights become a type of real property that may be sold or inherited.1 Mineral Rights Ownership in Minnesota The owner of mineral rights in Minnesota has the right of entry to explore for and mine minerals, with the surface owner compensated for any resulting damages to the surface. If the State of Minnesota owns the mineral rights to any land, state law prohibits the sale of those rights; however, they may be leased at public sale. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) has historically purchased highway right-of-way subject to mineral rights, without purchasing the mineral rights. Minnesota Statutes section 160.10 provides that unless there is an agreement that the road must be relocated at the road authority’s expense, the owner of the mineral rights is responsible for costs of relocating the road. Roads or highways in areas of valuable minerals, such as the Iron Range, are built using both approaches. The costs of the mineral rights are weighed against the risk of being required to move the road in the future. In the circumstance of this project, the 1960 easement agreement between MnDOT and the owner of the minerals (US Steel Corporation, succeeded by RGGS) states that MnDOT is responsible for the highway relocation. This resulted in MnDOT being able to use the property for over fifty years for the highway but allowed the property owner (RGGS) to terminate the easement agreement at no cost to RGGS. MnDOT is committed to acquiring a permanent solution (greater than 99 years) to address mineral rights that would not require MnDOT to pay to relocate the new highway in the future. Mining Practices Minnesota Rules, part 6130.1200, item H requires a mining setback of 100 feet from road right-of-way, except where mine access or haul roads cross the road right-of-way, and 500 feet from any occupied dwelling, public school, church, public institution, county or municipal park, or cemetery unless allowed by the owner. The mine operator (UTAC) typically uses a 300 foot blasting setback from the road right-of-way for safety, which is a standard industry best practice, but can mine as close as 100 feet. These setbacks are not imposed by MnDOT, but they are part of the design and operating considerations as the project alternatives are refined if setbacks are required to protect and preserve the integrity of the roadway infrastructure. For the Build Alternatives, practical design will dictate whether setbacks are needed to avoid impacts from excavation and/or blasting within close proximity to the road base. Setbacks will be a point of negotiation with the mineral owners and their lessees. 4.1.1.2 Methodology Each alternative has been evaluated to identify the number of parcels that would be partially or totally acquired for right-of-way, within the proposed right-of-way limits, based on general construction limits, as shown in Figures 4.1-1 through 4.1-3. These construction limits cover the area needed during construction, including potential stormwater pond locations, which led to the identification of the right-ofway that would need to be acquired. Specific staging areas were not included in the construction limits. If staging areas are needed outside the areas of evaluation, they will be identified for the preferred alternative and evaluated in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Parcel data was obtained from St. Louis County for the study area and updated by MnDOT. Additionally, existing parcel access was considered to determine if access changes would be required as a result of road modifications. If so, new access options were identified. 1 See the Minnesota DNR Fact Sheet “Mineral Rights Ownership in Minnesota,” November 2000, found at: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/lands_minerals/ownership.html When determining if a parcel would be a total acquisition, the following factors were considered: ■ Would a partial acquisition create an uneconomical parcel or non-compliant parcel (one that no longer meets building codes and/or building setbacks and therefore has a reduced property value)? ■ Would a partial acquisition substantially impair the use of the parcel? ■ Would a partial acquisition eliminate or severely restrict access to the parcel? ■ Would a partial acquisition be a hardship for the landowner? ■ Would a total acquisition create an opportunity for right-of-way preservation, access management, or cost savings (by preventing future conflicts)? The estimated costs of right-of-way acquisition are included in Chapter 9: Cost Analysis. The process to acquire each parcel will follow federal regulation (49 CFR 24) and Minnesota Statutes (sections 117 and 160). Appraisals will be performed in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) published by the Appraisal Foundation. Additionally, to identify any mineral resources on any of the alternatives, MnDOT has obtained core samples for mineral analysis by the University of Minnesota’s Natural Resources Research Institute (NRRI) minerals lab in Coleraine, MN. NRRI staff is creating quantity models for valuation of mineral resources/rights that may require compensation. This valuation will be completed in 2015 and the results will be reported in the Final EIS. This analysis will estimate value based on the amount and quality (level of oxidation) of ferrous resources present, as well as its accessibility/location. Samples are also being evaluated for indicators of nonferrous resources and potential for them within the Alternative E1-A and E-2 alignments. Since this data is currently unavailable, general resource estimates were used with risk factors added for cost estimating purposes to allow qualitative comparison of alternatives (see Chapter 9: Cost Analysis). Based on the Monte Carlo risk assessment (see Chapter 9: Cost Analysis) conducted for the cost estimates, the cost ranges provided for each alternative are expected to be representative estimations. The valuation data, when available, will be used to narrow the cost range and provide a basis for negotiation with mineral rights owners. The results of the mineral resource valuation will be used for cost estimating purposes only and will not change results of any other resource evaluation covered in this Draft EIS. 4.1.2 Existing Conditions This section describes ownership and parcel access for the land in the vicinity of the Draft EIS alternatives. Land and mineral rights in the vicinity of the project alternatives are largely owned by two parties, RGGS (Parcel 17) or the State of Minnesota School Trust (Parcel 18). Mine lands and mineral rights within the permit to mine area, environmental setting boundary, and existing easement agreement area (shown in Figures 1.0-1 and 4.2-1) are owned by RGGS. UTAC leases the lands within the environmental setting boundary from RGGS. Similarly, a non-ferrous metallic mineral lease has been granted by the State of Minnesota to Vermillion Gold, Inc. on the School Trust land. The location of the School Trust land and other parcels in relation to the Build Alternatives is shown on Figures 4.1-1 through 4.1-3. 4.1.2.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) The No Build Alternative stays within existing right-of-way of the reroute roadways (MN 37, Co. 7, US 169) and is limited to adding new signage. There are no direct driveway access points along US 53 between 12th and 2nd Avenues or between Cuyuna Drive and MN 135. There is one access to the Mineview in the Sky (an elevated viewing area open to the public) and one to RGGS property within the existing easement agreement area between 2nd Avenue and MN 135. MnDOT and RGGS/UTAC boring data indicates that the existing easement agreement area is rich in ferrous resources. 4.1.2.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) This alternative stays within one parcel, as it is confined by the existing US 53 easement agreement area, established in 1960 by an agreement (Appendix A) between MnDOT and United States Steel Corporation (now RGGS). The existing easement agreement provides the legal limitations of the existing easement area depicted in Figure 2.1-4. In May 2010, UTAC and RGGS provided notice to MnDOT regarding the termination of easement rights, and the easement agreement was amended in May 2012 to modify the easement termination date to May 2017. Two driveway access points are provided to RGGS property on the north and south sides of US 53. These access points serve RGGS land to the south and Mineview in the Sky to the north. The Mineview in the Sky is subject to a license agreement held by RGGS. As noted above, MnDOT and RGGS/UTAC boring data indicates that the existing easement agreement area is rich in ferrous resources. 4.1.2.3 Alternative M-1 Alternative M-1 is routed through the operating UTAC mine, where surface and mineral rights are owned by RGGS, and UTAC leases the right to mine from RGGS. As the corridor proceeds to the northwest and approaches existing US 53, the adjacent parcels are undeveloped with no structures and do not have direct access to US 53. Alternative M-1 is located largely on RGGS property (see Figures 4.1-1 and 4.1-4). There are 13 parcel owners (Parcels 2, 3, 4, 12, 17, 18, 19, 23, 207, A35, A38, A42, and A49) adjacent to the M-1 corridor, none of which have direct driveway access to US 53. Based on MnDOT core samples, the M-1 corridor is higher in ferrous resources (when considering the full width of right-of-way and mining setbacks) than initially estimated during the Scoping process by UTAC and MnDOT. 4.1.2.4 Alternative E-1A Alternative E-1A departs from existing US 53 north of Cuyuna Drive, routing primarily through lands owned by the State of Minnesota School Trust (Parcel 18) and RGGS (Parcel 17) before returning to existing US 53 near the 2nd Avenue interchange. A variety of property types, including residential, commercial, and industrial, exist in the area surrounding 2nd Avenue. There are 16 parcel owners (Parcels 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, 30, and 207) adjacent to the E-1A corridor, none of which have direct driveway access to US 53 (see Figures 4.1-2 and 4.1-5). Parcel 16 (2nd Avenue Auto) does have direct access to 2nd Avenue. MnDOT drilled 28 ferrous exploratory borings within the E-1A alignment area (as of September 18, 2014) in an effort to determine the potential extent of ferrous resources that may be encumbered by this alternative (see Figure 4.1-6). Preliminary results indicate that most of the iron formation is absent and/or highly oxidized within the E-1A alignment from the southern end of the drilling project to the west high wall of the pit. However, preliminary results also indicate high grade iron ore will likely be found between the west high wall and east boundary of the city of Virginia. The Alternative E-1A ferrous ore evaluation will be completed in 2015. MnDOT also drilled six non-ferrous/metallic exploratory borings within the E-1A alignment in an effort to determine the extent of these potential resources (currently under exploration/mining lease) which the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR)/School Trust identified and suggested could be encumbered by this alternative. Chemical analyses and reporting of non-ferrous/metallic mineral presence on the E-1A alignment will be completed in 2015. Right-ofway/easement costs will be subject to the estimated quantity and quality of ferrous and non-ferrous resources encumbered by this alternative, with costs increasing as the quality and/or quantity increases. 4.1.2.5 Alternative E-2 Alternative E-2 departs from existing US 53 at approximately the MN 135 interchange, routing primarily through lands owned by the State of Minnesota School Trust (Parcel 18) and RGGS (Parcel 17), including lands owned by RGGS that are not currently leased by another entity, before returning to existing US 53 near the 2nd Avenue interchange. The UTAC boundary shown on Figure 1.0-1 marks the limits of the UTAC lease on lands owned by RGGS. A variety of property types exist in the area surrounding 2nd Avenue, including residential, commercial, and industrial. These properties have access to US 53 via 2nd Avenue. There are eight parcel owners (Parcels 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 23, 24, and 207) adjacent to the E-2 corridor, none of which have direct driveway access to US 53 (Figures 4.1-3 and 4.1-7). Parcel number 16 (2nd Avenue Auto) does have direct access to 2nd Avenue. MnDOT drilled 21 ferrous exploratory borings within the E-2 alignment area (as of September 18, 2014) in an effort to determine the potential extent of ferrous resources that may be encumbered by this alternative (see Figure 4.1-6). Preliminary results indicate that high grade iron ore will likely be found within most of the E-2 alignment area. Iron formation is absent and/or highly oxidized in a short stretch through the pit (bridge area) as well as in a short stretch adjacent to and north of Landfill Road. Alternative E-2 ferrous ore evaluation will be completed in 2015. MnDOT also drilled four nonferrous/metallic exploratory borings within the E-2 alignment area in an effort to determine the extent of these potential resources (currently under exploration/mining lease) which the DNR/School Trust identified and suggested could be encumbered by this alternative. Chemical analyses and reporting of non-ferrous/metallic mineral presence on the E-2 alignment area will be completed in 2015. Right-ofway/easement costs will be subject to the estimated quantity and quality of ferrous and non-ferrous resources encumbered by this alternative, with costs increasing as the quality and/or quantity increases. 4.1.3 Environmental Consequences 4.1.3.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) No new right-of-way acquisition is necessary to implement the No Build Alternative. Parcels No new right-of-way acquisition is necessary for this alternative. Access to Mineview in the Sky/RGGS from the existing easement agreement area would be eliminated along with the existing US 53 road segment between 2nd Avenue and MN 135. The segments of existing northbound US 53 between Cuyuna Drive and MN 135 would be retained for access to MN 135. This portion of the existing easement agreement area would be purchased in fee or re-negotiated to preserve the corridor. Mineral Rights The No Build Alternative corridor utilizes existing roads to reroute traffic outside the ore formation. The signed route for US 53 (MN 37, Co. 7, and US 169) does not conflict with the Biwabik Iron Formation and is not anticipated to impact any ferrous or non-ferrous resources. 4.1.3.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) Under the Existing US 53 Alternative, existing roadways are left intact to retain the current operation of US 53. Parcels Fee acquisition of the existing easement agreement area (77 acres) from RGGS would be required to allow US 53 to remain within the existing easement agreement area corridor. Access to the Mineview in the Sky and RGGS parcels would remain unchanged. Mineral Rights The land and mineral rights in the existing US 53 alternative area are owned by RGGS. As per the 1960 easement agreement, at this time the State is responsible for costs to relocate the roadway upon notice. If the road is not relocated, the State may be subject to payment of damages to RGGS/UTAC. Fee acquisition of the existing easement agreement area could be extremely costly and presumably need to be acquired by condemnation because RGGS/UTAC would not be a willing seller. The volume of ferrous resources is estimated to be substantial in this alternative, whereas the landowner has not indicated that there are any non-ferrous metallic resources of concern here. Based on two independent methods for estimating resource quantity and value by MnDOT, the cost to acquire the easement agreement area is estimated to be in the $400-600 million range. 4.1.3.3 Alternative M-1 US 53 Mainline Corridor This alternative generally cuts through the existing Auburn Pit with the majority of impact to one property owner, RGGS, and the leaseholder, UTAC (see Figure 4.1-1). Connection to 2nd Avenue West The entire four lanes of existing roadway are not necessary to retain this local connection, which will be provided via the new Southern Drive intersection. Current designs for maintaining the local roadway assume use of the northbound lanes of US 53 for the local road. The southbound lane portion of US 53 would be removed, potentially allowing some existing right-of-way to be available for other uses. Reconfiguration of the existing 2nd Avenue interchange to an at-grade roadway may also result in the acquisition of a small portion of the parcel currently owned by RGGS on the northwest corner of the US 53/2nd Avenue interchange, similar to the No Build Alternative (see Figure 2.3-2). Removal of the 2nd Avenue interchange would reduce the right-of-way required for this location by eliminating the need for the loop ramp currently located on the south side of US 53. Some of this right-ofway may have other ancillary uses, such as for the provision of stormwater management ponds or snow storage. The segment of existing US 53 from the 2nd Avenue interchange to the new Southern Drive intersection would be subject to negotiations with the City of Virginia for a “turnback” of ownership to the City for what would become a local street. Connection to MN 135 Similar to the No Build Alternative, a portion of the existing easement agreement area containing US 53 is proposed to be retained for Alternative M-1. The eastern portion of the existing easement agreement area segment between MN 135 and Cuyuna Drive (Figure 4.1-1) would be purchased in fee or renegotiated to preserve the corridor. Parcels Portions of 13 parcels, including one total acquisition and a portion of the existing easement agreement area, would be acquired by this alternative, as shown in Table 4.1-1 and Figure 4.1-4. The greatest impact is to Parcel 17 through the mine. Access may be modified to Parcels 2, 17, and 207. No relocations would be required under this alternative. The proposed right-of-way area shown on Figure 4.1-1 includes areas needed for construction of this alternative, including stormwater management and other mitigation needed. If staging areas are needed outside of the new right-of-way, they will be identified and evaluated in the Final EIS. Table 4.1-1 summarizes the new right-of-way needed for Alternative M-1. Table 4.1-1 Summary of Alternative M-1 Right-of-Way Impacts EIS Document Parcel ID  Parcel Number/ Multiple Parcel IdentifierA  Land Use Classification  Parcel Size (acres)  Acres Impacted  Access Impacts  Anticipated Parcel Acquisition  Existing US 53 Easement Agreement Area  RGGS  Existing Road Easement  76.7  (13.9)B  N/A  Partial  2  090-0137-00030  Commercial  10.4  8.6  Yes  Partial  3  090-0137-00010  Commercial  1.8  0.2  No  Partial  4  City of Virginia  Municipal  21.9  0.4  No  Partial  6 and 7  Virginia Economic Development Authority  Municipal  14.4  0.6  No  Partial  12  State of Minnesota  Tax-Forfeited Real Estate  2.8  0.06  No  Partial  17  RGGS  Industrial  494.2  102.6  Yes  Partial  19  St. Louis County  County  41.8  0.7  No  Partial  23  090-0180-01570  Commercial  31.9  4.8  No  Partial  207  090-0180-01376  Commercial  14.3  14.3  Yes  TotalC  A38  090-0180-00986  Church Properties  1.0  0.04  No  Partial  A42  090-0140-00010  Residential  0.1  0.02  No  Partial  A49  090-0140-00550  Residential  0.1  0.01  No  Partial  TOTAL  132.3  A Source: St. Louis County Parcel ID numbers B This indicates the portion of the existing easement agreement area needed under Alternative M-1. It is not included in the sum of acres impacted as it is also covered under the RGGS parcel impacts. C Although only a portion of this parcel would be impacted, MnDOT would acquire the full parcel as it would create an opportunity for rightof-way preservation of an undeveloped parcel. Mineral Rights Even by crossing the Auburn Pit area identified by the mine operator for a new US 53 route, encumbrance of ferrous resources would occur with Alternative M-1. Recent drilling conducted by MnDOT and a reevaluation of the Alternative M-1 impacts by MnDOT and UTAC indicate that marketable ferrous resource impacts would be greater than initially identified during Scoping. This would result in substantially higher acquisition costs for right-of-way than were originally anticipated during the Scoping analysis due to the increase in estimated ferrous resources encumbered by the M-1 alignment and mining setbacks from the new road right-of-way, which were identified when the preliminary roadway layout was reviewed with UTAC. It is estimated that a strip through the mine approximately 1,100 feet wide would not be mineable using current right-of-way setback and mining practices (Figure 4.1-8).The landowner has not indicated that there are any non-ferrous metallic resources of concern here. 4.1.3.4 Alternative E-1A This alternative departs from existing US 53 north of Cuyuna Drive and crosses MN 135 before turning to the northwest to cross the Rouchleau Pit, with the majority of the impact to two property owners, RGGS and the State of Minnesota School Trust. US 53 Mainline Corridor As Alternative E-1A crosses north of MN 135, it enters School Trust land controlled by the Minnesota DNR (Figure 4.1-2). As described in Table 4.1-2, the estimated impact area for Alternative E-1A RSS Option is 53.2 acres of right-of-way in the School Trust lands (Parcel 18). This includes approximately 4.6acres of DNR lands within the Iron Range Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area (OHVRA), within the proposed right-of-way. The Bridge Option would result in no changes to the number of parcels affected and may have a smaller right-of-way area impact. The amount of land that would be acquired overall for highway right-of-way within the OHVRA has been minimized to the extent possible at this stage of design, taking into consideration topographic and geometric constraints. The road alignments have been shifted as far west as feasible while balancing elevation, grades, safety, and minimizing resource impacts. For more discussion of the OHVRA and potential impacts, see Section 4.3. Connection to 2nd Avenue West Conversion of the partial interchange to an at-grade intersection would reduce the right-of-way required for this location by eliminating the need for the loop ramp currently located on the south side of US 53. The excess right-of-way may have other ancillary uses, such as for the provision of stormwater management ponding for the new roadway and snow storage. Connection to MN 135 ■ Intersection Option Conversion of the interchange access at MN 135 to an at-grade intersection would occur under the Intersection Option. Access would be retained with an at-grade, ¾ intersection with the westbound MN 135 to southbound US 53 movement being eliminated or provided with a restricted crossing U-turn north of the intersection. As shown in Figure 4.1-5, a small area of new right-of-way (from Parcel 18 – State of Minnesota) would be necessary to create the new intersection. A portion of the existing easement agreement area containing US 53 is proposed to be retained for Alternative E-1A. The eastern portion of the US 53 easement agreement area between MN 135 and Cuyuna Drive (Figure 4.1-2) would be purchased in fee or renegotiated to preserve the existing MN 135 exit ramp corridor. ■ Interchange Option The amount of additional right-of-way needed to replace an at-grade intersection with a compressed diamond interchange at MN 135 is 1.2 acres, of which 0.5 acres is within the OHVRA, resulting in a total OHVRA impact of 5.1 acres for this option as shown in Figure 4.1-9. This additional impact to the OHVRA is caused by changes in roadway elevation and the need to raise the grade in this area for grade separation at the interchange. Similar to the Intersection Option, the MN 135 exit ramp corridor would also need to be acquired for the Interchange Option. Parcels There are 18 parcels, in addition to the existing easement agreement area, that could be impacted by this alternative, under either the RSS Option or the Bridge Option, as shown in Table 4.1-2 and Figure 4.1-5. The greatest impact is to Parcels 17 and 18. The location of this impact may vary within the area of evaluation shown in Figure 2.2-1, but the magnitude should remain relatively unchanged. Access may be modified to Parcels 14, 16, 17, 23, and 24. Figure 4.1-5 shows Parcels 14, 15, 16, 24, 25, and 207 as potential total acquisitions with the Intersection Option. Parcels 16 and 25 have structures and/or a business that would require relocation. The remaining parcels do not require any relocations. With the Interchange Option, the same number of parcels would be impacted and the same parcel access modifications would be required, but there would be two fewer total acquisitions (see Figure 4.1-9). Parcels 24 and 25 would be impacted but would not be total acquisitions because the elevation of the interchange would be closer to the existing roadway elevation. The Intersection Option would require a greater elevation change (the roadway would need to be excavated down) and would therefore have a larger footprint than the intersection. Under this alternative, the current access configuration to Mineview in the Sky would no longer be available. The proposed right-of-way area shown on Figure 4.1-2 includes areas needed for stormwater management. Table 4.1-2.

It is not included in the sum of acres impacted as it is also covered under the RGGS parcel impacts. D Although only a portion of this parcel would be impacted, MnDOT would acquire the full parcel as it would create an opportunity for rightof-way preservation of an undeveloped parcel. Mineral Rights Ferrous resources are present on this alternative, but low ore grades and, to a lesser extent, inaccessibility due existing mining setbacks from the buildings in Virginia greatly diminish their value. Setbacks from the new road right-of-way would not encumber ferrous resources of high quality or quantity (Figure 4.1-10). There are potential impacts to the ability to explore for and mine non-ferrous metallic resources on School Trust lands within the proposed right-of-way for this alternative. MnDOT is in the process of evaluating core samples to better understand the quantity and quality of ferrous and non-ferrous metallic resources within this alternative. Analyses will be completed in 2015 and available results summarized in the Final EIS for the preferred alternative or as otherwise appropriate to update Draft EIS findings. There may also be a potential value of a lease held by Vermillion Gold, Inc. on School Trust land. The terms of the lease agreement held by Vermillion Gold, Inc. stipulate that the DNR cannot issue other leases, permits, or licenses that unduly interfere with the exploration of mineral resources on the School Trust land (Figure 4.1-2). The edge of the Biwabik Iron Formation begins near Landfill Road and has been mined in the past per recent core samples and DNR records; thus, the eastern edge of this alignment has low potential for ferrous or non-ferrous metallic resources. Easement or acquisition costs for road right-ofway may need to consider necessary mining setbacks from the proposed road. 4.1.3.5 Alternative E-2 This alternative generally follows the existing Landfill Road alignment and crosses over the Rouchleau Pit, with the majority of impact to two property owners, RGGS and the State of Minnesota School Trust. US 53 Mainline Corridor As Alternative E-2 crosses north of MN 135, it enters School Trust land controlled by the DNR (Figure 4.1-3). As described in Table 4.1-3, the estimated impact area for Alternative E-2 is 67.4 acres of right-of-way in the School Trust lands (Parcel 18). This includes approximately 4.3 acres of DNR lands within the OHVRA, shown within the estimated right-of-way limits. However, the amount of land that would be acquired overall for highway right-of-way may be less than shown; the impacts to the OHVRA have been minimized to the extent possible at this stage of design, taking into consideration topographic and geometric constraints. The road alignments have been shifted as far west as feasible while balancing elevation, grades, safety, and minimizing resource impacts. For more discussion of the OHVRA and potential impacts, see Section 4.3. Connection to 2nd Avenue West Conversion of the partial interchange to an at-grade intersection would reduce the right-of-way required for this location by eliminating the need for the loop ramp currently located on the south side of US 53. The remaining right-of-way may have other ancillary uses, such as for the provision of stormwater management ponding for the new roadway and snow storage. Connection to MN 135 ■ Intersection Option Conversion of the interchange access at MN 135 to an at-grade intersection would occur under the Intersection Option. Access would be retained with an at-grade, ¾ intersection with the westbound MN 135 to southbound US 53 movement being eliminated or provided with a restricted crossing U-turn north of the intersection. As shown in Figure 4.1-7, a small area of new right-of-way (from Parcel 18 – State of Minnesota) would be necessary to create the new intersection. Similar to the No Build Alternative, a portion of the existing easement agreement area containing US 53 is proposed to be retained for Alternative E-2. The eastern portion of the US 53 existing easement agreement area between MN 135 and Cuyuna Drive (Figure 4.1-7) would be purchased in fee or renegotiated to preserve the corridor. ■ Interchange Option The amount of additional right-of-way needed to replace an at-grade intersection with a compressed diamond interchange is 4.5 acres. It does not increase the acres needed from the OHVRA. This option would impact the same number of parcels and would not result in any additional total acquisitions or parcel access modifications (see Figure 4.1-11). Parcels The proposed right-of-way area shown on Figure 4.1-3 includes areas needed for stormwater management. ■ Straight Option There are eight parcels, in addition to the existing easement agreement area, that could be impacted by the Straight Option, as shown in Table 4.1-3 and Figure 4.1-7. The greatest impact is to Parcels 17 and 18; the location of this impact may vary within the area of evaluation shown in Figure 2.1-6, but the magnitude should remain relatively unchanged. Access may be modified to Parcels 14, 16, and 17. Figure 4.1-7 shows Parcels 14, 16, and 207 as total acquisitions. Parcel 16 has structures and/or a business that would require relocation. The remaining parcels do not require any relocations. By using a portion of the Landfill Road alignment for Alternative E-2, the current access for Landfill Road from MN 135 would no longer be functional. Access to the Landfill Road would be provided directly from US 53, including a median crossover to allow access to Landfill Road from southbound US 53. Under this alternative, the current access configuration to Mineview in the Sky would no longer be available. ■ Curved Setback Option The Curved Setback Option would impact one additional parcel compared to the Straight Option (Parcel 30). The impact to this parcel (0.02 acres) would be similar to the impact from Alternative E-1A as shown in Table 4.1-2. Table 4.1-3.

It is not included in the sum of acres impacted as it is also covered under the RGGS parcel impacts. C Although only a portion of this parcel would be impacted, MnDOT would acquire the full parcel as it would create an opportunity for rightof-way preservation of an undeveloped parcel. Mineral Rights Estimated right-of-way setbacks are shown in Figure 4.1-21. There are substantial ferrous resources on the east-west portion of this alternative on RGGS and School Trust lands outside the current permit to mine boundary. There are also potential impacts to the ability to explore for and mine non-ferrous metallic resources on School Trust lands within the proposed right-of-way for this alternative. MnDOT is in the process of evaluating core samples to better understand the quantity and quality of ferrous and nonferrous metallic resources within this alternative. Analyses will be completed in 2015 and available results summarized in the Final EIS for the preferred alternative or as otherwise appropriate to update Draft EIS findings. There may also be a potential value of a lease held by Vermillion Gold, Inc. on School Trust land. The terms of the lease agreement held by Vermillion Gold, Inc. stipulate that the DNR cannot issue other leases, permits, or licenses that unduly interfere with the exploration of mineral resources on the School Trust land (Figure 4.1-3). The edge of the Biwabik Iron Formation begins near Landfill Road per recent core samples and DNR records; thus, the eastern edge of this alignment has low potential for ferrous or non-ferrous metallic resources. However, costs may need to consider necessary mining setbacks from the proposed road. The segments of existing northbound US 53 between Cuyuna Drive and MN 135 would be retained for access to MN 135. This portion of the existing easement agreement area south of the existing MN 135 interchange would be renegotiated to permanently preserve the corridor for transportation purposes. 4.1.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures 4.1.4.1 Avoidance and Mitigation Measures Efforts have been made during alternatives development and preliminary engineering of the various alternatives to minimize the amount of new right-of-way needed to the extent possible by following previously disturbed areas (roads, mined lands). Alternatives M-1, E-1A, and E-2 all use part of the eastern portion of the existing easement agreement area to maintain a connection to MN 135 (Cuyuna Drive to the MN 135 segment). For purposes of this analysis, a permanent solution has been assumed for this common segment. Based on the nature of mine operation at the Midway area of Virginia and the geology of this area (it cannot be mined due to road and building blasting setbacks), MnDOT is committed to a permanent acquisition of right-of-way for this segment. MnDOT evaluated the potential for acquiring new right-of-way outside the existing easement agreement area for the MN 135 connection, in case the existing easement agreement area cannot be acquired. The Build alternatives (M-1, E-1A, and E-2) require some reconstruction/reconfiguration of the local connection to MN 135 from US 53. Options for this connection were investigated that would avoid requiring continued use of the existing easement agreement area; rather, each would result in acquisition of land outside of the existing easement agreement area as permanent right-of-way. These options are described in the Alternatives Development Report (Kimley-Horn, 2014; provided in Appendix K) and would not preclude UTAC from mining up to the edge of the existing easement agreement area due to the road alignment and setback shifting east. Per DNR records, the area of US 53 south of MN 135 is east of the Biwabik Iron Formation. After consideration of several alternate alignments, a shift east of the existing easement agreement area was incorporated into Alternative E-1A and the Alternative E-2 Curved Setback Option, with modifications to minimize relocation and wetland impacts. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) guidance emphasizes the protection of the public investment in transportation infrastructure. An important aspect of cost-effectiveness is the longevity of any alternative. MnDOT understands the risk for future relocation for property that cannot be purchased in perpetuity. Therefore, MnDOT is committed to negotiate a permanent solution (greater than 99 years) to protect the public investment and highway infrastructure. 4.2 Economic and Business 4.2.1 Methodology The scope of the economic analysis has changed since the 2012 Scoping Document was completed. During the Scoping process and as documented in the February 2012 Scoping Document, the scope of the economic and business analysis was anticipated to be qualitative based on the estimated loss of property tax due to right-of-way acquisition, increased travel times including changes in access to businesses, as well as business impacts to mine operations due to air quality requirements. This section still covers two primary areas of economic interest. First, the areawide business and economic impact of increasing travel time to cross the Biwabik Iron Formation, and second, the short and long-term risk to business operations of the UTAC mine that the existing US 53 easement agreement area crosses. However, as alternatives evolved and a western alternative was reconsidered during the 2013 amended Scoping process, it was determined by MnDOT that a more quantitative economic analysis would better define potential impacts to the local communities and businesses. As a result, MnDOT completed the Highway 53 Relocation Economic Impact Study (McComb Group and SEH, 2014) to not only address travel times and business access, but also evaluate more in depth the potential impacts to area businesses, residents, and community services. As such, a qualitative assessment of property tax loss and business access became irrelevant, as the more detailed assessment of business losses captured the intent of the previously defined scope. The Economic Impact Study compared the Build Alternatives and Existing US 53 Alternative to the W-1A Alternative. The rationale for combining the Build Alternatives M-1, E-1A, and E-2, and Existing US 53 Alternative (“No Build Option1” in the study) is that the economic analyst determined that they all would have essentially the same economic effect as existing conditions (i.e., no substantial change in travel distance or time that would affect local/regional economies). Similarly, the W-1A and No Build (“No Build Option 2” in the study) Alternatives would have similar impacts following the same alignment. However, it should be noted that the No Build Alternative would likely have worse impacts than Alternative W-1A since there would be no roadway improvements to increase existing capacity. However, for purposes of this analysis, it was assumed that Alternative W-1A would adequately represent the magnitude of impacts that would result from the traffic re-routing that would occur with the No Build Alternative based on the study techniques and may therefore be referenced synonymously. Areawide Economic Impacts The following evaluation of potential economic and business impacts within the study area is derived from the Highway 53 Relocation Economic Impact Study (McComb Group and SEH, 2014), incorporated herein by reference and available on the project website.2 This assessment relies heavily on the Highway 53 Relocation Economic Impact Study (McComb Group and SEH, 2014). This study evaluated the difference in potential economic and business impacts between the Build Alternatives and the No Build condition of rerouting of US 53 to the west along MN 37 and Co. 7. The Economic Impact Study goes into detailed assessment of travel times, patterns, and travelsheds, as well as commuting costs, effect on business sales, lodging, and area jobs. The areawide economic impacts sections below summarize key parts of the economic study which demonstrates the potential economic impacts to the Quad Cities (Virginia, Eveleth, Mountain Iron, and Gilbert) and other East Range cities3 resulting from the change in distance and travel time between cities. This section also generally covers the expected economic impacts to community/public services. A more detailed discussion of community service impacts is covered in Section 4.7. 2 http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/TechnicalReports.html 3 East Range cities, for the purposes of this document, are defined as Eveleth, Gilbert, McKinley, Biwabik, Aurora, and Hoyt Lakes. Mine Operation Impacts This discussion, as previously scoped, reflects a qualitative assessment of how each road alignment location would affect access to ferrous resources (considering right-of-way and blasting/mining setbacks), access to mine facilities, and anticipated mine operation risks associated with long term air quality compliance requirements. Mine operations were considered in areas with a current permit to mine and environmental setting boundary. A permit to mine means legal approval has been given by the commissioner of the DNR to conduct a mining operation. Beyond the permit to mine boundary is the environmental setting boundary, which includes additional areas that may be directly or indirectly affected by mine activity and is the boundary most closely aligned with the area leased by the mine operator (see Figure 4.2-1). Therefore, the term “permit to mine” is used when describing the area of mine operations, and the term “environmental setting boundary” is used when referring to the broader, legal limits of the UTAC mine. The only permit to mine or environmental setting boundary within the study area is issued to UTAC as the mine operator, and is shown in Figure 1.0-1. To obtain a permit to mine and environmental setting boundary for a new mine operation requires an environmental evaluation by the DNR based on an approved mining plan submitted by the mine operator. The DNR determines the level of evaluation needed for a proposed expansion of an existing mining operation (Minnesota Statutes, section 116D).4 Any non-mining activity proposed within the permit to mine area or environmental setting boundary could potentially be in conflict with mining operations and deemed a potential business impact to the mine operator and landowner. It is known that UTAC has a lease agreement with RGGS in the vicinity of the Built Alternative alignments; it has been assumed for purposes of this document that the lease boundary generally follows the environmental setting boundary. It should be noted that it is not the purpose of this Draft EIS to determine the air quality impact of mining activities. MnDOT must comply with the legal requirements of the easement regardless of what the landowner’s intent is for the vacated easement agreement area. In this case, mining activities were determined to be separate undertakings and not connected actions5 for the following reasons: ■ The US 53 relocation project and mine activities do not have the same purpose. The US 53 highway relocation is needed to respond to the terms of the easement agreement and continue to provide a facility that meets transportation needs (connectivity, capacity, mobility, safety). ■ The mine’s future business activities are not part of the undertaking of relocating US 53. The existing easement agreement area is outside of the current permit to mine boundary. Expanding the permit to mine boundary would require separate environmental review by the DNR. The extent of air quality analysis for this Draft EIS is related only to qualitatively assessing the potential business risk impact the road project would have on the mining business’s ability to meet its permit requirements at the new road alignment. 4.2.2 Existing Conditions US 53 as Local Economic Transportation Link Mountain Iron and Virginia (the main portion) are located on the north side of the Biwabik Iron Formation/UTAC mine, and the Midway neighborhood of Virginia, Eveleth, and Gilbert are located on the south side of the formation/mine (Figure 4.2-2). The existing easement agreement area of US 53 provides the primary connection across the formation/mine between these communities; it links Mountain Iron and the main/larger portion of Virginia to Virginia’s Midway neighborhood and links Eveleth and Gilbert to Virginia’s main business districts. The existing easement agreement area currently carries more traffic (22,850 vehicles per day in 2011) than any other segment of US 53 in the study area. This 4 Information on mineland permitting is also available at http://dnr.state.mn.us/lands_minerals/mineland_reclamation/index.html 5 Connected actions are defined in Minnesota Rules, part 4410.0200, subpart 9c and 40 CFR Part 1508.25 heavy demand on the existing easement agreement area of highway indicates the importance of this link within the area’s transportation network. Beyond the Quad Cities, US 53 is also an important link to West Range cities (defined for the purposes of this document as Hibbing and Chisholm) via US 169 and MN 37 West, and the East Range cities (Hoyt Lakes, Aurora, and Biwabik) via MN 135 and MN 37 East. Local Businesses US 53 provides transportation system access to numerous business centers and commercial/retail businesses in Eveleth, the Midway area, and Virginia (via South 2nd Avenue West, South 12th Avenue West, and 13th Street South). According to the City of Virginia’s webpage, businesses take advantage of the access provided by the highway. Figure 4.2-2 shows the location of these business centers and commercial developments, including the Thunderbird Mall (which houses 32 businesses and is located in the southern part of the city), major chain restaurants, national big box retail and grocery stores, and a car dealership. Essentia Health-Virginia is also a major employment center and destination that benefits from access to US 53. Other business areas in Virginia include downtown (which includes retail stores along a five block stretch of Chestnut Street), the Northgate Plaza in north-central Virginia, and the 8th Street South locations. A number of industrial sites are also dependent on US 53 for deliveries and distribution, including: ■ Pearsall Industrial Park: 34 acres, located southwest of the US 53 corridor ■ Hoover Industrial Park: 31 acres, located at the western edge of Virginia and accessible from US 53 and US 169 ■ Progress Park: a 240 acre high-tech business park that is a joint effort of Virginia and Eveleth and part of the Statewide Job Zone; located between Virginia and Eveleth and accessible from US 53 These and other businesses in the Quad Cities depend on US 53 for exposure to potential clients, accessibility, and interconnection to/from respective businesses (reasonable travel times). These and other businesses are important to the Quad Cities for the jobs they provide as well as the tax revenue they generate. UTAC Mine The UTAC mine is a specific business that provides a number of economic benefits to the Quad Cities area. It extends south from the existing easement agreement area to Eveleth and several miles to the southwest. Access to the mine is via US 53 south of the existing easement agreement area, near Eveleth. Taconite is shipped from the site via rail. The UTAC mine is not dependent on US 53 for distribution of its products (taconite, ferrous resources); however, it is dependent on US 53 for deliveries, other services, and access for its employees. According to the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board (IRRRB) and local Economic Development Authority (EDA), UTAC and other mine-related businesses are major employers in the area and, as a result, are an integral part of the local economy. Mining provides local jobs, requires support from other businesses in the area (fuel, mechanical, geotechnical), and generates taconite production taxes. The Taconite Production Tax is collected by the state (Minnesota Statutes section 298.24) and is paid by mines in lieu of property taxes based on the amount of taconite produced annually. The objective of the Taconite Production Tax is to focus mining industry tax revenues on Iron Range communities. These funds are distributed to cities and townships, school districts, counties, and government agencies in the Taconite Assistance Area. See Appendix D for more information about distribution of the Taconite Production Tax. As an example of the economic influence of this tax, in 2011 the City of Virginia received just over $1,000,000 in direct revenue from Taconite Production Tax distributions (about 10.4 percent of all such funds are paid directly to cities). Additional local benefits from the Taconite Production Tax came through aid to the local school district, property tax relief, and projects and programs administered by IRRRB. For reference, the City of Virginia had a total 2012 property tax revenue capacity of $3,844,822, demonstrating that the Taconite Production Tax is an important component of the City’s budget. Mining operations are subject to compliance with a number of permits. If compliance is not achieved, operations can be jeopardized. In the vicinity of the existing easement agreement area, UTAC has a permit to mine from the DNR and other environmental permits (e.g., air quality and National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)) from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA). UTAC’s permit to mine boundary is shown in Figure 4.2-1 and excludes the existing easement agreement area but includes land on both sides of the easement. The MPCA air quality permit requires UTAC to conform to air quality standards at its permit to mine boundary. The existing easement agreement area is outside the permit to mine limits and is not subject to these air quality standards. UTAC’s mine pit operates under an air quality permit to ensure compliance with federal and state air quality regulations. The primary criteria pollutants emitted from an open pit mine are particulate matter (PM), PM10, and PM2.5.6 The US Environmental Protection Agency’s (USEPA) current National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM10, based on a 24-hour average exposure, is 150 micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m3), which should not be exceeded more than once per year on average over three years. The PM2.5 threshold is based on a 24-hour average exposure of 35 μg/m3 averaged over three years. In addition, the MPCA has a state PM standard for a maximum 24-hour concentration, not to be exceeded more than once per year, of 260 µg/m3 for the primary standard and 150 µg/m3 for the secondary standard (Minnesota Rules, part 7009.0080). These standards are applicable at the mine boundary. The existing US 53 roadway is outside of UTAC’s mine boundary. Recent business risk assessment modeling for the proposed Build Alternatives has been conducted by UTAC and discussed with MPCA, EPA, and MnDOT regarding potential for mine particulate emissions depending on the new location of US 53. The road location in relationship to UTAC’s operations will affect the potential emission levels at the mine boundaries. For example, being located closer to haul roads, stockpile locations, and crushing functions has a higher potential for increased particulate emissions. Since it is UTAC's responsibility to monitor and maintain compliance with air quality standards at its permit to mine boundary, it has conducted a qualitative analysis to determine the business risks (potential air quality non-compliance) the road location alternatives could have on its mining operation. 4.2.3 Environmental Consequences Certain direct economic impacts, such as potential for non-mining business property acquisitions or relocations, and property access changes are evaluated in more detail in Section 4.1 and are not reported here. 4.2.3.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) Areawide Economic Impacts Due to concerns raised regarding potential business and economic impacts that could result from eliminating an existing crossing of the Biwabik Iron Formation (as would occur under the No Build Alternative and W-1A Alternative considered in 2013 Scoping), an Economic Impact Study was conducted (McComb Group and SEH, 2014). This study compared the Build and Existing US 53 Alternatives to the US 53 reroute that would be utilized under the No Build Alternative. This analysis used the same assumptions regarding Co. 101 as described in Chapter 3: Transportation Analysis, where Co. 101 was assumed to be closed by UTAC by the year 2024. This is based on reports from UTAC that it may close the road in the near future for mining purposes; therefore, Co. 101 was evaluated as open before 2024 and closed after 2024 in order to address potential worst case impacts. The following provides a summary of the findings. 6 Particulate matter (PM) is the term for particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air. Particles come in a wide variety of sizes and have been historically assessed based on size, typically measured by the diameter of the particle in micrometers. PM2.5, or fine particulate matter, refers to particles that are 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter. PM10 refers to particulate matter that is 10 micrometers or less in diameter. ■ Travel Distance and Time Travel times were developed and documented in the Economic Impact Study as well as the Traffic Analysis Technical Report (CH2M Hill, 2013). The travel times reported in these documents vary slightly due to differences in end points used for analysis and rounding to the whole minute. For purposes of this Draft EIS, the times provided in the Traffic Analysis Technical Report are referenced throughout, and details are provided in Chapter 3: Transportation Analysis. Both the travel time study and a benefit-cost study7 show a high user cost incurred with the relocation of US 53 to the No Build reroute (west). Travel times were compared between business centers rather than to specific businesses or business types. Every vehicle trip between the city of Virginia and either city of Eveleth or Gilbert, and the business centers within these areas (Figure 4.2-2), would have travel time increases of nine minutes (Eveleth) to 21 minutes (Gilbert) based on increased trip lengths (Tables 3.1-5 and 3.1-6). Section 3.1.3 summarizes the changes in both distance and travel times that would occur for the Build Alternatives compared to the No Build Alternative. The No Build Alternative would negatively impact the connectivity of existing business concentrations to the surrounding local community, thereby making it less convenient to access these businesses. This is evidenced by travel distances and travel times which would more than double under the No Build Alternative from Virginia to Eveleth and more than triple to Gilbert. Impacts on individual businesses would vary widely as customer-business connections vary depending on business characteristics. A potential array of economic impacts resulting from the increased travel time was further investigated. The changes in traffic counts resulting from the closing of US 53 (No Build Alternative) between Virginia and Eveleth would have detrimental impacts on businesses located in Virginia, Midway, Eveleth, and Gilbert along MN 135 west of MN 37. Increased traffic counts resulting from the No Build Alternative may have temporary positive impact in downtown Eveleth as long as the Co. 101 shortcut is in operation. In 2024, assuming Co. 101 is closed by UTAC, traffic counts would be severely reduced, and Eveleth businesses would suffer accordingly. The closing of Co. 101 would result in the worst case impacts to Eveleth businesses; if Co. 101 would remain open, Eveleth would be impacted by congestion rather than elimination of through traffic. The additional traffic volumes on the No Build Alternative route may benefit the convenience retail node located at the intersection of MN 37 and Co. 7. ■ User Costs The benefit-cost analysis (vehicle miles traveled and operating costs compared to vehicle hours traveled) determined that the rerouting of traffic to the west under the No Build Alternative would result in increased user costs between 2017 and 2037 of over $765 million (an increase from $1.14 billion for the Existing US 53 and Build Alternatives to $1.91 billion for No Build Alternative (in 2013 dollars)) due to changes in travel times between the Quad Cities. ■ Commuter Costs Based on 2011 employment numbers, it was estimated that about 5,500 employed residents in the study area would experience increased travel times as a result of the No Build Alternative. Affected commuters are expected to increase to about 6,000 in 2017, 6,900 in 2024, and 8,600 in 2037. The estimated total user costs borne to commuters for the period 2017 to 2037 is $324 million (in 2013 dollars). These commuters are included in the benefit-cost analysis described above but demonstrate how the rerouting of travel under the No Build Alternative would affect one specific user group. The annual impact on individual commuters represents a significant portion of their income. Workers living or working in Gilbert or other East Range cities and commuting over the 7 See Chapter 9: Cost Analysis for more information on the benefit-cost study current US 53 route would drive an additional 7,650 miles annually and spend an additional 152 hours commuting with the No Build Alternative. Additional annual travel and time costs for each employee are estimated at $4,653 (in 2013 dollars). Annual increased commuting costs of this magnitude would cause workers to consider changing either their home or work location. ■ Retail Impacts Virginia, Mountain Iron, and Eveleth contain the Quad Cities’ largest concentration of retail stores and services. Increased travel and time costs associated with rerouting travel under the No Build Alternative would have broad economic impacts on residents, businesses, and visitors to the area. The increases in travel times would change shopper behavior. Some residents of the Iron Range already shop in the Duluth area for destination retail goods and services. Given the larger concentration and variety of retail stores and services in Duluth, some shoppers would change their shopping patterns to combine purchases of goods that they currently buy in Virginia to more frequent trips to Duluth, diverting sales from the Virginia retail areas to stores in Duluth. Virginia/Mountain Iron: The largest retail concentration is in Virginia and the eastern portion of Mountain Iron. Virginia/Mountain Iron retail sales in 2017 are estimated at $560 million8 (in 2013 dollars). Market research found that 33 percent of these sales ($183 million) were derived from customers living in the East Range area (i.e., Hoyt Lakes). The longer drive time associated with a shopping trip to Virginia/Mountain Iron from East Range cities (up to 45 minutes one way) under the No Build Alternative was estimated to result in a sales transfer (i.e., people choosing another area in which to shop) of $41 million or 7.4 percent of total sales in the 2017-2023 period. Most of this 7.4 percent was assumed to transfer to Duluth and Hermantown (about 90 minutes from Hoyt Lakes), which have much larger retail areas, offer greater selection, and shoppers currently use this destination for specific services. Some convenience goods and service (daily needs) spending would transfer to businesses in East Range cities. In 2024, Virginia retail sales are expected to be about $645 million (in 2013 dollars), with $211 million derived from shoppers residing in the East Range area. Of this amount, $95 million (14.7 percent) of total sales are estimated to be transferred to retail stores in other locations. Reduced retail sales in Virginia are estimated to result in a loss of 372 jobs between 2017 and 2023, increasing to a loss of 844 jobs after 2024. Eveleth: Market research found that 34 percent of Eveleth retail sales are derived from customers living in Virginia and cities to the west and north. Eveleth’s retail sales are estimated at $87 million in 2017 with $30 million derived from shoppers living to the west and north. Retail sales transfer resulting from the No Build Alternative is estimated at $9 million (10.5 percent) of retail sales. Retail sales transfer would increase if the Co. 101 shortcut is closed by UTAC (assumed by 2024). Total 2024 retail sales are estimated at $100 million with $34 million derived from shoppers living west and north of the Biwabik Iron Formation. Sales transfer is estimated at $20 million of estimated 2024 retail sales. Reduced retail sales at Eveleth retail establishments would result in the loss of an estimated 76 jobs between 2017 and 2023, increasing to 154 jobs lost in the 2024-2037 period. ■ Business Impacts Businesses in the study area make deliveries or service calls to customers living on either side of the Biwabik Iron Formation, resulting in frequent trips using existing US 53. Based on business survey responses, the estimated increased travel and payroll cost to local businesses would be $46 million in the period from 2017 to 2023, increasing to $97 million annually in the period from 2024-2037. 8 Based on estimated number of retail establishments, estimated retail sales, employment, and payroll data from the Census Bureau and Minnesota Department of Revenue ■ Public Sector Impacts Eliminating the current US 53 route between Virginia and the East Range cities would have significant impacts on community services, affecting budgets for emergency and support services, school transportation, and other services due to expanded infrastructure (e.g., additional fire station) and additional mileage to maintain the same services (e.g., bus routes, emergency service routes). Residents living in the Quad Cities, together with other East Range cities, depend upon shared services making travel among communities frequent and necessary. Shared services include ambulance, police, fire, K-12 education, special education, a two campus community and technical college, St. Louis County Social Services, and economic development agencies. The City of Virginia has estimated an increase in annual expenses of $3.6 million and in capital expenditures through 2037 of over $24 million as a result of the reroute of travel under the No Build Alternative (based on estimates for increased infrastructure and travel time to maintain existing services). Mine Operation Impacts Because the No Build Alternative closes the existing easement agreement area and includes no other highway construction within or near the UTAC mine, it would have little or no direct impact on mineral resource accessibility or the mine’s business volume since rail is the primary ferrous resources transport method. However, due to extended travel times, it may impact employees getting to/from work, deliveries to/from the mine, and other emergency and support services it may depend on for daily operations, but these impacts would be relatively minor. Since the No Build Alternative would affect no areas identified with ferrous resources, it is estimated to have no measureable impact on Taconite Production Tax generation. 4.2.3.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) Areawide Economic Impacts The Existing US 53 Alternative would have no impact on travel times, as compared to the existing condition, and, therefore, no effect on area economics or businesses. Mine Operation Impacts This alternative would present a conflict with UTAC’s future access to ferrous resources within the existing easement agreement area and/or north of US 53. The amount of ferrous resources located within these areas is not known precisely but is estimated to be in greater quantities within the existing easement agreement area than within the M-1, E-1A, or E-2 alignments. Much of the ferrous resources within the existing easement agreement area would remain inaccessible to future mining under this alternative. Because the Taconite Production Tax is paid in lieu of local property taxes (Minnesota Statutes section 298), there would be no direct property tax revenue impacts due to loss of production; however, a reduction of local revenue from the Taconite Production Tax due to reduced production could have an economic impact on the Quad Cities. In addition, maintaining mining access to both sides of US 53 is important to UTAC’s future mining business operation north of the existing US 53 corridor. Actual mining of the ferrous resources is only one step. Access to crushing equipment to process the ferrous resources is also vital to making those resources available for commercial use. UTAC’s crushing equipment is located south of the existing US 53 easement agreement area, and UTAC has stated that it is not feasible to relocate the crusher or add a second crusher north of the easement. In order to get mined materials to the crusher and/or to the rail for export, access under US 53 would be required. Additionally, UTAC has explained to MnDOT that they rely on several types of ferrous resources to compose a single commercial product, and prohibiting or limiting mining in the area north of US 53 may prevent the recovery of a certain type of resource that is needed to blend with resources from other areas. Therefore, if such an agreement could be reached to allow a US 53 easement, it may include damages paid for loss of access to resources north of the easement as well as resources within the existing easement agreement area. 4.2.3.3 Build Alternatives (Alternatives M-1, E-1A, and E-2) Areawide Economic Impacts The Build Alternatives would have no measureable economic impact as a result of changes in travel times as compared to the existing condition. Travel time differences for these alternatives generally vary less than three minutes from the existing condition. The economic study indicated that from an economic standpoint, the time differences are not substantial enough to change behavior. For all Build Alternatives, road closures for blasting would occur at a frequency similar to the existing condition. There are a variety of property types, including commercial, industrial, and residential, in the area around the 2nd Avenue interchange, and this location provides an important connection to the east side of Virginia. The new at-grade access would offer full access to 2nd Avenue from both directions (via the new Southern Drive intersection for Alternative M-1) versus the current partial access. This added accessibility would be beneficial to the properties at the south end of 2nd Avenue and elsewhere in Virginia. Similarly, creating a new at-grade intersection at MN 135 to replace the existing interchange (under Alternative M-1 and the Alternative E-1A and E-2 Intersection Options) may benefit development potential through improved local access opportunities near this intersection as well. If the full-access compressed diamond interchange option is selected with either the Alternative E-1A or E-2 Interchange Option, similar development opportunities may occur near the new interchange. Mine Operation Impacts ■ Alternative M-1: This alternative would be located within the operating UTAC mine, primarily along an area that was previously mined and partially backfilled (the Auburn Pit). However, this alternative still presents potential operational issues for the mine as there are ferrous resources remaining on both sides of this alignment. Mining on both sides of the new road alignment would require US 53 design and construction measures to minimize the roadway footprint in the mine to limit conflicts with ferrous resource reserves (see mitigation discussion below). Therefore, road design methods would be considered to limit the conflicts with ferrous resource access and mine operations. This alternative also presents a conflict with UTAC’s future access to ferrous resources below or directly adjacent to the M-1 alignment. UTAC conducted a business risk assessment to estimate the ferrous resources that would be excluded from production based on the Alternative M-1 concept plans, proposed right-of-way, and mining setbacks needed for operations. This results in a strip through the mine approximately 1,100 feet wide that would not be mineable using current setback and mining practices (Figure 4.1-8). Although the amount of ferrous resources encumbered by the M-1 alignment is estimated to be less than quantities within the existing easement agreement area (as a result of previous mining activity), the inability to access these resources would adversely affect UTAC’s business operations. Most of the ferrous resources within the existing easement agreement area would be accessible to future mining under this alternative; therefore, it would be available for production and generation of Taconite Production Tax, although the ferrous resources within and adjacent to the M-1 corridor would not be accessible. Another potential business impact of this alternative could result from routing a public roadway closer to or through the existing mine pit. The USEPA’s NAAQS set allowable concentrations of air pollutants in any location the public can access. The proximity of Alternative M-1 to the mine pit might impact UTAC’s ability to meet ambient standards for receptors on the highway without altering its current operation. As described in Section 4.2.2, PM, PM2.5, and PM10 are the primary air pollutants emitted from a mine pit. The standard thresholds for these pollutants are based on an average exposure to particulates for a receptor, in this case on the road, over a 24-hour period. Because the NAAQS do not provide exceptions for exposure to non-stationary receptors such as cars, USEPA has indicated that the PM, PM2.5, and PM10 standards would apply to Alternative M-1 alignment. UTAC’s air quality modeling indicates that without modifying its current operations, the PM10 standard would not be met on the northern quarter of the proposed alignment segment through the mine (Appendix E). MPCA staff discussed modeling protocols with UTAC but did not review the model in detail as the model’s purpose was to inform UTAC regarding the level of business risk it would assume if it needed to alter its operations to meet the current standard and to assess the margin of safety it has to meet potential future changes in the standards. The impact to UTAC could be large under this alternative if the mine needed to modify its current operations or alter planned operations (e.g., use larger trucks to reduce number of trips, relocate a crusher, limit mining operations near road) to meet NAAQS. Additionally, meeting the NAAQS under this alternative could make it challenging to permit future modifications to the mine. See Section 4.2.4 for options to address this risk. Throughout the process of developing and refining this alternative and analyzing effects, coordination has been taking place with RGGS/UTAC as the owner and operator of the mine. During this time, UTAC has also been conducting its own examination of routes and potential impacts to mine operations in the context of current operations, future plans, regulations, and changing economics that directly affect the industry. Based on its ongoing examination of issues regarding the mine, UTAC has identified concerns related to Alternative M-1 (see Appendix C for correspondence from UTAC dated March 2014). With implementation of this alternative, UTAC believes it would not be able to mine an area of significant ferrous resources, reducing the life of the mine and thereby limiting the positive, long-term employment and economic benefits of the operation for the surrounding communities. This, combined with potential blasting setback impacts and safety risks of road construction within an active mine, has led UTAC to determine they cannot risk the future viability of the mine by encumbering ferrous resources, creating an environmental compliance risk, or accepting health and safety hazards that come with Alternative M-1. ■ Alternative E-1A: This alternative may present a minor conflict with future access to ferrous resources, as the alternative skirts the north and south edges of the Biwabik Iron Formation, resulting in some mining setbacks from the new road alignment (Figure 4.1-10); however, remaining resources are limited. Even though this alignment crosses the existing UTAC permit to mine boundary, the majority of the alignment has been previously mined, and it is believed that the alignment’s relative encumbrance of ferrous resource reserves would be less than other alternatives. Ferrous resources are present on this alternative, but low ore grades and, to a lesser extent, inaccessibility due to estimated mining setbacks from buildings in the city of Virginia greatly diminish their value. There are potential impacts to the ability to explore for and mine non-ferrous metallic resources on School Trust lands within the proposed right-of-way for this alternative. MnDOT is in the process of evaluating core samples to better understand the quantity and quality of ferrous and non-ferrous metallic resources within this alternative. Analyses will be completed in 2015 and available results summarized in the Final EIS for the preferred alternative or as otherwise appropriate to update the Draft EIS findings. The potential for mineral resource recovery conflicts with Alternative E-1A is recognized. Similar to Alternative M-1, UTAC assessed the potential future business risk of routing a public roadway (Alternative E-1A) through its existing permit to mine boundary area. Under Alternative E-1A, UTAC could plan ahead for strategic stockpile and haul road locations to minimize air quality risks near the new road alignment. UTAC’s business risk assessment modeling showed low business risks for the Bridge Option and higher risks under the RSS Option. UTAC has indicated that with the higher elevation and free air flow under the bridge, the Bridge Option would pose lower risk for air quality-related concerns compared to the lower elevation and embankment of the RSS Option. The RSS Option may direct air flow toward the road, and UTAC may be required to further alter operations to meet the PM10 standard. Therefore, the Alternative E-1A Bridge Option is not expected to result in an air quality-related business risk to the existing mine operations due to the applicability of ambient air quality regulations, based on a qualitative risk analysis conducted by UTAC. With the RSS Option, UTAC has air quality-related business risk concerns similar to those discussed above for Alternative M-1. With regard to blasting setbacks, a greater area of the mine would be encumbered by the RSS Option than the Bridge Option due to the width of the fill section. Neither option would be constructed within an active mine area, thus having low safety concerns. ■ Alternative E-2 (Straight and Curved Setback Options): This alternative presents a conflict with future access to ferrous resources, as the alternative skirts the north and south edges of the permit to mine boundary, resulting in potential mining setbacks from the new road alignment (Figure 4.1-12). However, it is outside of the existing UTAC permit to mine boundary. Alternative E-2 also has potential to present a conflict with non-ferrous metallic resource exploration and mining of resources such as gold. Vermillion Gold, Inc. has a lease with the State of Minnesota to explore for, mine, and remove non-ferrous metallic resources near the Alternative E-2 alignment on School Trust land. The potential for a non-ferrous metallic resources mining business, and its configuration (open or underground mining), has not been identified; however, the potential for mineral resource recovery conflicts with Alternative E-2 is recognized. MnDOT is in the process of evaluating core samples to better understand the quantity and quality of ferrous and non-ferrous metallic resources within this alternative. Analyses will be completed in 2015 and available results summarized in the Final EIS for the preferred alternative or as otherwise appropriate to update Draft EIS findings. Alternative E-2 is located outside the northeastern edge of the existing permit to mine boundary and further from the current mine operations and existing roadway. Based on the location of the alignment relative to future mining activities and UTAC’s business risk assessment, Alternative E-2 is not expected to result in a business risk to the existing mine operations due to the applicability of ambient air quality regulations as this alternative is outside the existing operation and permit to mine boundaries and is less likely to impact current and future planned operations at the mine. As with Alternative E-1A, construction would not occur within an active mine; thus, Alternative E-2 has lower safety risks than Alternative M-1. 4.2.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures 4.2.4.1 Avoidance and Minimization Measures Measures for Mining Operation Impacts In developing the Build Alternatives, MnDOT has made efforts to avoid/mitigate impacts to known mineral reserves, to the extent possible, to minimize the economic impacts to mineable mineral reserves. All potential business risk costs to MnDOT (potential damages) have been incorporated into the cost range estimates for each alternative (see Chapter 9: Cost Analysis). ■ No Build Alternative This alternative is outside the permit to mine boundary and, therefore, does not pose a risk to mining operations with regard to (air quality compliance) business risk. ■ Existing US 53 Alternative By definition, this alternative does not avoid the fundamental mining business conflict of the existing easement agreement area because it would encumber iron ore and, therefore, affect the potential life of the mining operation. ■ Alternative M-1 MnDOT and UTAC worked to identify measures to minimize potential risk for air quality compliance impacts on UTAC’s operations through roadway design, minimizing mine dust generation, and development of a plan to minimize potential exposure of highway users to mine air emissions through incorporation of intelligent transportation system (ITS) and highway design measures. One of the measures MnDOT incorporated to minimize the potential for air quality concerns was to design the road elevation for Alternative M-1 as high above the active mine area as possible. The road profile for this alternative was raised approximately 20 feet. On the northern quarter of the alignment, however, due to the touchdown point elevation that the alignment needs to tie into existing development, the profile in this area could not be raised high enough to eliminate potential air quality standard compliance risks. In coordination with MPCA and UTAC, the air quality model revealed that up to ¾ of the M-1 alignment through the mine would be in compliance with current standards. In addition, MnDOT has identified measures (described in Section 4.2.4.2) that could be used to minimize risk or highway user exposure within the mine segment of the highway for the M-1 Alternative. UTAC has evaluated additional measures that would minimize air quality issues near the road (described in Section 4.2.4.2). These are largely measures that would reduce dust generation. However, according to UTAC’s risk assessment, these measures would not ensure that UTAC would meet the air quality standards at the new road alignment. This information was shared with MPCA and USEPA staff; however, since these measures may not result in compliance with the air quality standards, they would not eliminate the business risk related to non-compliance with air quality permit thresholds for Alternative M-1. ■ Alternative E-1A Based on UTAC’s business risk assessment for the Bridge Option, UTAC can manage its operations within the permit to mine area to remain in compliance with air quality permit requirements resulting in low risk potential to future mine operations. The potential risk to private mining has been reduced by routing the alignment through previously mined areas and has limited risk to mineral resources by running the alignment along the submerged haul road embankment, which has been previously mined. ■ Alternative E-2 (Straight and Curved Setback Options) This alternative is outside the permit to mine boundary and, therefore, does not pose a risk to mining operations with regard to (air quality compliance) business risk. The potential risk to private mining has been reduced by routing the alignment around the current permit to mine area and has limited risk to mineral resources by running the alignment along Landfill Road, which is near the southeast edge of the Biwabik Iron Formation. 4.2.4.2 Mitigation Measures Measures for Travel Time Changes The changes in travel time for all alternatives are directly related to the changes in the distance of the alignment or reroute. The Build Alternatives have little impact to travel times and, therefore, no identified economic impacts, requiring no mitigation measures. The No Build Alternative would be the only alternative with substantial economic impacts due to travel time changes; however, there is little that can be done to improve travel times under the No Build Alternative due to the reroute alignment length. Measures for Mining Operation Impacts ■ Existing US 53 Alternative By definition, this alternative does not avoid the fundamental mining business conflict of the existing easement agreement area because it would encumber iron ore and, therefore, affect the potential life of the mining operation. ■ Alternative M-1 This alternative does not completely avoid the mining business conflict of the M-1 alignment through the mine. This alternative minimized the roadway footprint within the mine, to the extent possible (2:1 side slopes instead of 4:1) reducing the road footprint from an average of 900 feet to 450 feet, and it also provides accommodations (two bridges) to allow access for mining on both sides of the new US 53. Standard mine operations require a 300 foot setback from the new right-of-way resulting in an average 1,100 foot wide corridor through the mine that would not be mineable, encumbering more ferrous resources than UTAC and MnDOT had anticipated. In an effort to minimize business risks to mine operations due to air quality permit compliance concerns, MnDOT investigated the potential to provide a physical barrier over the roadway for this alignment to prevent user exposure to potential PM10 exceedances from mine dust. This analysis is documented in two technical memos9 which are included in Appendix E. Two tunnel options were considered that included construction of a three-sided concrete cover that in effect creates an “elevated tunnel” that US 53 would travel through. Option 1 spanned the full permit to mine limits (6,100 feet) to avoid any exposure within the permit area and to minimize the air handling equipment necessary. Option 2 shortened the length of tunnel to extend just beyond the potential exceedance area (3,000 feet) with air filtration to treat potential dust levels at the portals. The combined structure and air handling (including fire safety) equipment result in a cost range of $65 to $130 million of additional construction cost for Alternative M-1 (in addition to the roadway cost), which may not be feasible given other project costs (see Chapter 9: Cost Analysis). These options have not been evaluated by UTAC to confirm whether they would eliminate the potential business risk from air quality compliance. ■ Alternative E-1A Alternative E-1A does not avoid the future potential conflict with known ferrous resources or non-ferrous metallic mineral reserves owned by the State of Minnesota School Trust and by private interests. MnDOT has conducted a series of borings along this alignment to estimate the amount and quality of ferrous resources that are present. Core samples collected from these borings have confirmed that there are limited ferrous resources along the E-1A alignment except on the west edge of the Rouchleau Pit, where the resources are likely too close to existing structures to be mined. The RSS Option was assumed with steep, engineered soil slopes in order to minimize the road footprint across the Biwabik Iron Formation. A bridge at the east edge of the alignment could be provided at a future time that would allow mine access under the roadway if it is required for UTAC mining operations at that time (estimated 30 + years in the future). The Bridge Option would place the road on a bridge structure across the pit, eliminating the need for fill within the Rouchleau Pit, allowing the road elevation to be increased and drain to the west side of the pit. This bridge would allow for future mine access to the north but may restrict distance from the bridge that mining/blasting activity may occur. ■ Alternative E-2 (Straight and Curved Setback Options) Alternative E-2 does not avoid the future potential conflict with known ferrous resources or non-ferrous mineral reserves owned by the State of Minnesota School Trust and by private interests. MnDOT has conducted a series of borings along this alignment to estimate the amount and quality of ferrous resources that are present along Landfill Road. These borings have confirmed that ferrous resources are at least 200 to 400 feet west of Landfill Road, which indicates that most of the ferrous resources would remain accessible with this alternative. Mining beyond the current permit to mine limits to the north cannot be predicted; none of the nearby mine owners or operators have this area identified in their current mining plans, and, therefore, this area is not likely to be mined for a number of decades unless a substantial shift occurs in market demand. 4.3 Public Park, Recreational, Wildlife Management, and Section 4(f)/6(f) Lands This section provides information about public recreational and natural resource areas within the study area, and potential project impacts to identified resources. Section 4(f) and Section 6(f) applicability are addressed within this section for the study area’s parks, recreation, and natural areas. The discussion of Section 4(f) applicability related to historic sites is addressed in Section 4.4. Figure 4.3-1 provides the locations of the public parks, recreational areas, and trails within the study area. 9 Highway 53 M-1 Alignment Air Quality Mitigation Memo (CH2MHill, 2013) and Structural Cost Estimate for Elevated Tunnel for US 53 Alternative M-1 Air Quality Mitigation (Kimley-Horn, 2013) 4.3.1 Regulatory Context and Methodology 4.3.1.1 Regulatory Context Because some of the resources identified in this section may have potential to be impacted by one or more project alternatives, the regulatory requirements for defining Section 4(f) and 6(f) resources and impacts are provided for reference. Section 4(f) Section 4(f) of the 1966 Department of Transportation (DOT) Act (49 USC 303, 23 USC 138)10 provides protection for publicly owned parks, recreation areas, historic sites (public or private), and wildlife refuges from conversion to a transportation use. Section 4(f) applies only if the following criteria are met: ■ Federal transportation funds are anticipated or an action is being taken that requires approvals by a federal transportation agency ■ The property is publicly owned and/or open for long-term public recreational use, or meets historic property criteria if privately or publicly owned ■ When on publicly owned multiple use lands, recreation is the primary purpose/designated use11 The Section 4(f) evaluation process requires that any impacts from direct use12 of a publicly owned park, recreation area, historic site, or wildlife or waterfowl refuge for highway purposes be evaluated in context with the proposed highway construction/reconstruction activity. When a Section 4(f) use is anticipated, applicable regulations also require consultations with the official having jurisdiction over the site to verify the site’s significance and coordinate conclusions on use of the land, including efforts to avoid or mitigate the impacts.13 FHWA may not approve the use of land from a significant publicly owned park, recreation area, or wildlife and waterfowl refuge, or any significant historic site unless a determination is made that: ■ There is no feasible and prudent alternative to the use of land from the property; and ■ The action includes all possible planning to minimize harm to the property resulting from such use (23 CFR 774.17); or ■ The use is de minimis (23 CFR 774.3). For parks, recreation areas, and wildlife and waterfowl refuges, a de minimis impact is one that will not adversely affect the features, attributes, or activities qualifying the property for protection under Section 4(f) (23 CFR 774.17). Section 6(f): Land and Water Conservation Fund Act Lands improved with Land and Water Conservation Fund Act (LAWCON) funds are subject to Section 6(f). LAWCON, which is intended to help preserve, develop, and provide accessibility to outdoor recreation resources, requires that lands planned, developed, or improved with these funds cannot be converted to anything other than outdoor recreational use unless replacement land of at least equal fair market value and reasonably equivalent usefulness is provided. Any time a project will result in a land use conversion of public recreational lands that qualify under Section 6(f), replacement land of equal or greater use must be provided, regardless of how the project is funded. 10 In January 1983, as part of an overall reorganization of the DOT Act, Section 4(f) was amended and codified in 49 USC Section 303. However, the regulation is more commonly known as “Section 4(f).” 11 FHWA Section 4(f) Policy Paper, July 20, 2012 12 Section 4(f) “use” is defined under FHWA guidelines. A Section 4(f) use includes acquisition, temporary or permanent occupancy, or proximity impacts that result in substantial impairment of the purposes for which the Section 4(f) resource exists. Indirect use, or constructive use, can occur when a project does not incorporate any Section 4(f) resource land, but proximity impacts substantially impair activities, features, or attributes of the qualifying resource. 13 FHWA regulations (23 CFR 771.135 (c)) state that Section 4(f) resources are presumed to be significant unless the official having jurisdiction over the site concludes that the entire site is not significant. Even if this is done, FHWA must make an independent evaluation to assure that the official's finding of significance or non-significance is reasonable. Easements that do not involve conversion of outdoor recreational lands to non-recreational use are not subject to Section 6(f) requirements (e.g., provision of access to the property for maintenance, slope easements, etc.). Conversion of recreational property to a non-recreational use would require prior approval by the Commissioner of the DNR as well as from the National Park Service (NPS). The DNR maintains a list of properties that are subject to Section 6(f) requirements, which is available on the DNR’s LAWCON webpage.14 School Trust Property The State of Minnesota has approximately 2.5 million acres of surface and minerals in School Trust land status (defined in Minnesota Statutes section 92.025), mostly in the northern part of the state. Such publicly owned lands, set aside in trust for the financial support of schools, are a long established tradition in the United States. Revenue from School Trust lands is generated from many activities, including sale of timber and gravel, mining leases, state forest campground fees, lakeshore leases, easements and utility licenses across School Trust land, the sale of a few parcels of land, and several other types of surface use. In addition, revenue is generated from rents and royalties on iron ore removed from Trust land, leases to remove peat, non-ferrous metallic mineral leases, and several other types of mineral rights use.15 School Trust land is managed according to the plans for the management unit in which it is located.16 4.3.1.2 Methodology The study area for identification of park, recreation, and wildlife management resources includes areas generally near or adjacent to the project alternatives. Potential impacts were identified to resources generally within the areas of evaluation as shown in Figure 4.3-1 and described in Chapter 2: Alternatives. For Alternative M-1, this area was used to calculate potential impacts. For Alternatives E-1A and E-2, the areas of evaluation were widened in areas where there is potential for design adjustments in the alignment to accommodate currently undefined solutions to known engineering challenges (e.g., existing areas of unstable fill and bridge type). Therefore, to calculate potential impacts without overestimating them due to the widened area of evaluation, a corridor averaging 200-400 feet wide was assumed for Alternative E-1A, and a corridor averaging 150-300 feet wide was assumed for Alternative E-2 (the Alternative E-1A RSS Option requires a larger footprint). The identification of park, recreation, and wildlife properties involved review of mapping and data sources for publicly owned lands in the study area as well as historic sites, whether privately or publicly owned. Additional criteria were then applied to evaluate whether resources were eligible for consideration as Section 4(f) and/or Section 6(f) properties as discussed in the subsections below. Section 4.3.3 describes potential project impacts to each resource, including determination of whether a Section 4(f) “use” or a Section 6(f) conversion of land would occur. Determination of the “use” of a Section 4(f) resource was made based on definition of “use” in 23 CFR 774.17, guidance provided in FHWA’s Section 4(f) Policy Paper (July 20, 2012), and review with FHWA staff. 4.3.2 Existing Conditions This section describes all existing public recreational resources within the study area and identifies if they have been determined to be Section 4(f) or Section 6(f) properties. Mesabi Trail on School Trust Land The segment of the Mesabi Trail located on School Trust land (managed by the DNR) is leased by the St. Louis and Lake Counties Regional Railroad Authority (SLLCRRA) from the State for public recreation use (Appendix F). The current lease was signed in November 2011 and is effective for 10 years; however, it 14 The list entitled Grant-Funded Parks and Natural Areas Subject to Permanent Grant Program Requirements dated 7/28/2014 was checked on October 13, 2014. This list is available at http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/aboutdnr/lawcon/lawcon_1.pdf. 15 Minnesota’s School Trust Lands Biennial Report, FY 2010-2011; Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, March 2012 16 Minnesota Office of the Legislative Auditor (http://www.auditor.leg.state.mn.us/ped/1998/stl98.htm) can be terminated at the discretion of the DNR for just cause at any time. Specific lease terms are found in Appendix F. Adjacent segments of the Mesabi Trail are located on privately owned land and do not have long-term easement agreements with the landowners. Located in northern Minnesota between the cities of Ely and Grand Rapids, the Mesabi Trail is currently 115 miles long.17 When complete, the trail will be 132 miles long and connect more than 25 communities. The Mesabi Trail system is partially built on old railroad beds, and the trail consists of a 10-foot wide paved surface (typically asphalt) with some trail segments along public roads. Allowed trail activities include bicycling, inline skating, walking, cross-country skiing, and snowshoeing. Wheeled activities (bicycles, inline skates) require a trail permit. The trail passes through forests, meadows, rivers, streams, and lakes and past the edges of the open pit mines. Many campgrounds, local parks, and a variety of recreational opportunities are accessible from the trail. The one-mile segment of the Mesabi Trail within the School Trust land is characterized by forests and lands previously disturbed by forestry and mining activities (Figure 4.3-1). This segment of the trail is accessed from designated trailhead and parking areas: ■ In Virginia, about three trail miles northwest of the School Trust property (on the west side of the Rouchleau Pit) ■ In Gilbert, about three trail miles east of the School Trust property ■ From Mineview in the Sky located on RGGS property along the existing easement agreement area Alternatives E-1A and E-2 both cross the segment of the Mesabi Trail within School Trust land. Section 4(f) Determination: Even though this segment of trail is on publicly owned lands, the terms of the Mesabi Trail lease agreement between the SLLCRRA and DNR allow for the lease to be terminated at the discretion of the DNR. Therefore, it has been determined that the segment of the Mesabi Trail on School Trust land is not a Section 4(f) resource west of Landfill Road based on recreational (trail) use designation not being long-term. Mesabi Trail on Private Land The overall characteristics of the Mesabi Trail are described above. West of the School Trust land, the Mesabi Trail is routed on RGGS property along the southwest side of the Rouchleau Pit extending along the northeast edge of Virginia. The SLLCRRA holds a license from RGGS for the trail operation which is revocable by RGGS at any time with a one-year notice, which requires the licensee to vacate the property within 30-days of the license termination date (Appendix F). There are no public parks along the privately owned segments of the Mesabi Trail in the study area. Like the Mesabi Trail on School Trust lands, trail activities include bicycling, inline skating, walking, cross-country skiing, and snowshoeing. Wheeled activities (bicycles, inline skates) require a trail permit. A portion of this trail is also used as the Trail Hawks Snowmobile Spur Trail, as shown in Figure 4.3-1. Section 4(f) Determination: Because this segment of trail is on private land and operates via a license which can be terminated by the landowner at any time with 30 days to vacate, it has been determined that this segment of the Mesabi Trail is not a Section 4(f) resource because the terms of the license did not constitute a long-term public interest. Iron Range Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area (OHVRA) – Virginia Site This recreation area is located on School Trust land (Section 16, Township 58N, Range 17W), along the east edge of Landfill Road in the US 53 study area. It is owned by the State of Minnesota and managed by the DNR. The OHVRA is 2,700 acres and is master planned to include a 75-mile road/trail system. 17 St. Louis & Lake Counties Regional Railroad Authority (http://www.mesabitrail.com/maps-images/interactive-map?about) This 2,700-acre area is an expansion of the existing 1,200-acre OHVRA, currently accessed near Gilbert, MN.18 The state legislature authorized expansion of this site in 1999. The expanded Virginia site will link to the Gilbert site, making for a total OHVRA facility of about 3,900 acres. The Virginia site will be developed exclusively for trail riding for all classes of motorized off-highway vehicles (OHVs).19 According to the DNR, the OHVRA public recreational use area is only designated for public recreational use on School Trust land to the east of Landfill Road (Figure 4.3-1). The main OHV trail segment to be developed would be roughly parallel to Landfill Road ¼ to ½ mile to the east, crossing the Mesabi Trail in this area. The OHVRA Master Plan Amendment identifies lands west of Landfill Road as unused for public recreation and intended for mine/mineral use (Appendix F). The area west of Landfill Road is within the Biwabik Iron Formation (Figure 1.2-2) and is designated in the Master Plan for potential mineral use (nonrecreational use). The DNR verified that the Master Plan designations are correct (Appendix C, January 2013 letter). Section 4(f) Determination: The recreation area (OHVRA) east of Landfill Road has been determined to be a Section 4(f) resource based on ownership and designated long-term recreational use, whereas the area of OHVRA/School Trust land west of Landfill Road has been determined to not be a Section 4(f) resource because the DNR OHVRA Master Plan indicates mine/mineral use for the area west of Landfill Road and, therefore, has no intended long-term recreational use. Trail Hawks Snowmobile Club Trail Spur The Trail Hawks Snowmobile Club Trail Spur, shown on Figure 4.3-1, is a local designated snowmobile route located primarily on RGGS property, with portions of the trail spur operating on MnDOT right-of-way. The portion of the trail in the study area uses part of the Mesabi Trail (private) alignment on the west side of the Rouchleau Pit (user permit required), a culvert/underpass across US 53 (MnDOT right-of-way), and RGGS property (within MnDOT easement) in the segment south of US 53 to Midway. South of the study area, from Midway to Eveleth, the spur runs in MnDOT right-of-way. The trail south of US 53 is a spur off of the Mesabi Trail leading to motels in Eveleth (the old Holiday Inn and Super 8) and was funded partially by the IRRRB. MnDOT has records of the IRRRB obtaining a permit (1999) to work in the right-of-way for grading the trail then transferring the trail to the Trail Hawks Snowmobile Club. The Club has conducted additional unpermitted clearing in the past few years. However, there is no MnDOT record found showing that the Club applied for or was issued the required Limited Use Permit or provided a certificate of insurance to operate within the existing easement agreement area or MnDOT right-of-way. In 2002 an old railroad bridge under US 53 was removed by MnDOT, which had served as the US 53 underpass crossing for the trail spur. Local businesses objected to closing the crossing and funding was found to install a box culvert for the trail spur to cross under US 53. The majority of the funding was from the IRRRB, but the Cities of Eveleth and Virginia and MnDOT contributed minor amounts of the cost. Section 4(f) Determination: The portion of the trail spur within the existing easement agreement area is privately owned by RGGS, with an easement to MnDOT for roadway use. MnDOT has not issued a permit to the Club to operate within its easement. The two areas where the trail is within MnDOT right-of-way (the crossing under US 53 by 2nd Avenue interchange and from Cuyuna Drive south to Eveleth) do not have the necessary Limited Use Permit or liability insurance to operate within MnDOT right-of-way. Therefore, whether within easement or right-of-way, such use can be terminated unconditionally at any time by MnDOT. Based on the temporary nature of this trail spur with regard to permitted use, this trail spur does not qualify as a Section 4(f) resource. 18 Iron Range Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area Master Plan Amendment for the Virginia Expansion, Division of Parks and Trails, DNR, January 29, 2010. 19 This includes all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), off-highway motorcycles (OHMs), and off-road vehicles (ORVs). ORVs include larger vehicles such as 4x4 trucks and jeeps. City of Virginia Southside Park (also referred to as PepeInjak Southside Park) The City of Virginia’s Southside Park is located along the north side of US 53, east of 6th Avenue South (Figure 4.3-1). The 5th Avenue South historic roadway terminates on the north edge of this park (see also the 5th Avenue Boulevard in Section 4.4). The park occupies 17 acres and includes three outdoor fields, tennis courts, a playground, and a building that contains four indoor courts. Off-street parking is provided at the terminus of 5th Avenue South and off of 6th Avenue South along the north side of US 53. Southside Park was originally developed in 1914 in relationship to the 5th Avenue Boulevard. It has since been expanded and improved and is included on the list of LAWCON 6(f) holdings. Conversion of any of the properties to a non-recreational use requires approval by the DNR’s commissioner, as well as from the National Park Service, when specifically indicated, as is the case for Southside Park. LAWCON grants that were distributed for the benefit of Southside Park between 1999 and 2012 included: ■ 2000: $3,000 grant to support construction of the multipurpose building ■ 2001: $10,000 grant for handicap-accessible playground equipment Section 4(f) and 6(f) Determination: Southside Park offers public recreational uses on publicly owned property and has been determined to be a Section 4(f) resource, as well as a Section 6(f) resource. Table 4.3-1 summarizes the recreational resources evaluated and which resources meet Section 4(f) and 6(f) criteria. Southside Park is the only resource that meets Section 6(f) criteria. Table 4.3-1. Summary of Potential Section 4(f)/6(f) Recreational Resources Resource and Type  Public Use?

Southside Park is the only resource meeting Section 6(f) criteria. 4.3.3 Environmental Consequences The following summarizes the coordination and evaluation completed for the identified park and recreation resource impacts. The No Build, Existing US 53, and M-1 Alternatives do not have any impact on recreational Section 4(f) or Section 6(f) resources but may have impacts to non-Section 4(f) recreational resources, both of which are noted below. Cumulative impacts to recreational resources are addressed in Chapter 7: Cumulative Impacts. 4.3.3.1 Parklands Mesabi Trail on School Trust Land Alternatives E-1A and E-2 cross over this existing segment of the trail. The trail currently crosses Landfill Road at grade. Both alternatives would cross the trail at roughly the same location (see Figure 4.3-1). For both alternatives MnDOT could provide a trail permit along the east side of each alternative, which could be used by the SLLCRRA to construct a new Mesabi Trail alignment. Mesabi Trail on Private Land Alternatives E-1A and E-2 cross over this existing segment of the trail on the west side of the Rouchleau Pit. The trail currently parallels US 53 then turns north along the west edge of the Rouchleau Pit. Both alternatives would cross the trail at roughly the same location. For both alternatives MnDOT could provide a trail permit along the east side of each alternative, which could be used by the SLLCRRA to construct a new Mesabi Trail alignment. The trail impact areas are shown in Figure 4.3-1. Iron Range OHVRA – Virginia Site Alternatives E-1A and E-2 east of the Rouchleau Pit both follow segments of Landfill Road. Landfill Road defines the west edge of the OHVRA’s designated public use area, and, therefore, these alternatives have potential to impact the OHVRA area. As noted in Section 4.3.2 above, the main off-highway vehicle trail for motorized off-road vehicle use is to be developed approximately parallel to Landfill Road ¼ to ½ mile to the east, running for about ¾ mile through this area, and would not be affected by either alternative. However, each alternative would require acquisition of strips of land along the westernmost fringe of the 3,900-acre OHVRA site (adjacent to Landfill Road). For the Alternative E-1A Intersection and Interchange Options, 4.6 and 5.1 acres of permanent right-of-way would be required, respectively. For both the Alternative E-2 Intersection and Interchange Options, 4.3 acres of permanent right-of-way would be required. See Figures 4.3-2 and 4.3-3. The lands to be acquired under each alternative are in areas of the OHVRA that are not designated for any specific use, activity, or feature. The purpose of the overall recreation area is for off-road vehicle use; however, those uses would be restricted to developed trails or designated use areas. The impact areas for Alternatives E-1A and E-2 are not located within any special use areas or planned trail corridors in the OHVRA based on the area master plan.20 The DNR was contacted to confirm that development plans remain consistent with the master plan, and the DNR concurred that the areas west of Landfill Road are not designated for present or future recreational use and therefore not Section 4(f) (Appendix C, DNR 2013 letter). Additionally, since the OHVRA is planned as highly active and noise-generating motorized recreational vehicle activity area, the temporary occupancy of OHVRA land east of Landfill Road during construction should not substantially impair activities, features, or attributes of the OHVRA (Appendix C, 2014 DNR letter). Since the public land west of Landfill Road is not used or planned to be used for recreation and the proposed impact areas immediately east of Landfill Road would not affect the use, activities, features, or attributes of the OHVRA, it has been concluded that the Section 4(f) parkland/recreational impact to the OHVRA would be negligible. As a result, FHWA intends to make a de minimis Section 4(f) determination (as described in 20 This includes all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), off-highway motorcycles (OHMs), and off-road vehicles (ORVs). ORVs include larger vehicles such as 4x4 trucks and jeeps. Section 4.3.4) for this impact and has notified the DNR of its intent. The DNR has concurred with this conclusion (Appendix C). Trail Hawks Snowmobile Club Trail Spur All of the Build Alternatives (M-1, E1A, and E-2) would remove the 2nd Avenue interchange and thus the bridges that currently go over the snowmobile spur trail. However, removal of these bridges would not interfere with trail use; future mining activity, rather than MnDOT, would result in eliminating this trail segment. Where the snowmobile trail shares the Mesabi Trail corridor, see the Mesabi Trail section for impacts. Because the snowmobile trail does not have a permit to operate within MnDOT’s easement agreement area, MnDOT has no obligation to the trail operator. As shown in Figure 4.3-1, Alternative M-1 would require a crossing of the trail spur near Cuyuna Drive and where the new MN 135 connection is made to US 53. To reduce the impact of two crossings and improve crossing safety, a new crossing could be designed in conjunction with the new at-grade intersection for MN 135. For Alternatives E-1A and E-2, the intent is for the snowmobile trail to co-locate with the Mesabi Trial. In Alternative M-1 the snowmobile trail would need to be rerouted likely along the No Build reroute alignment, as a trail easement across the mine would not be allowed. Southside Park No acquisition of land from Southside Park would be required for any alternative. The changes to the adjacent segment of US 53 would be minimal and generally limited to the southbound lanes. Therefore, there would be no Section 6(f) conversion of land and no use of Section 4(f) property. Table 4.3-2 summarizes the potential impacts to each parkland resource by alternative. Table 4.3-2.

C Determined to be a Section 4(f) resource D Determined to be a Section 6(f) resource 4.3.3.2 Section 4(f)/Section 6(f) Based on the information provided in Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3, the following conclusions have been made with regard to potential Section 4(f) and Section 6(f) resources. As noted in Table 4.3-1, there are two resources (Iron Range OHVRA and Southside Park) that were determined to be Section 4(f) resources and one (Southside Park) that is a Section 6(f) resource. When Section 4(f) resource impacts are not substantial and there is little potential to affect the function of the resource, a de minimis determination can be made by FHWA. The impacts of a transportation project on a park or recreation area that is considered a Section 4(f) resource and qualifies for Section 4(f) protection may be determined to be de minimis if: ■ The transportation use of the Section 4(f) property, together with any impact avoidance, minimization, and mitigation or enhancement measures incorporated into the project, does not adversely affect the activities, features, or attributes that qualify the resource for protection under Section 4(f); ■ The public has been afforded an opportunity to review and comment on the effects of the project on the protected activities, features, or attributes of the Section 4(f) property; and ■ The official(s) with jurisdiction over the property, after being informed of the public comments and FHWA's intent to make the de minimis impact finding, concur in writing that the project would not adversely affect the activities, features, or attributes that qualify the property for protection under Section 4(f). The following describes the potential use of the Section 4(f) resources identified above based on the impacts described in Table 4.3-2. Iron Range OHVRA – Virginia Site Alternatives E-1A and E-2 have potential to impact the OHVRA. There is a potential for strip acquisition of OHVRA land along Landfill Road based on the estimated right-of-way needed for Alternatives E-1A and E2, as shown in Figures 4.3-2 and 4.3-3. All construction activities would be contained within the proposed right-of-way and, therefore, would not require temporary occupancy of the OHVRA during construction. Based on impact location and the OHVRA and DNR information described previously in Section 4.3.3, the recreational use impacts and temporary construction impacts would be negligible. Additionally, since the OHVRA is planned as highly active and noise-generating motorized recreational vehicle activity area, the permanent location of the new US 53 alignment or the potential temporary occupancy during construction would not adversely affect activities, features, or attributes of the OHVRA. The DNR, as the jurisdictional agency for this resource, has been consulted regarding the potential impacts of Alternatives E-1A and E-2 and has indicated the potential impacts would be small because the alignments affect fringe areas of the OHVRA and would not impede the intended use or function of the resource. Therefore, the impact would be negligible to this Section 4(f) resource. The FHWA sent notice of its intent to make a de minimis determination regarding this project to the DNR in a letter dated January 28, 2014 (Appendix C). DNR concurred with the proposed de minimis determination in a letter dated February 5, 2014, based on proposed construction limits (Appendix C). Southside Park No use or acquisition of land from Southside Park would be required for any alternative. The changes to the adjacent segment of US 53 would be minimal and generally limited to the southbound lanes. As a result there would be no use of Section 4(f) property. Additionally, there would be no Section 6(f) conversion of land. 4.3.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures The impacts to recreational resources within the existing easement agreement area are not caused directly by the US 53 relocation project; rather, it is the result of the termination of easement rights by RGGS and UTAC. Therefore, MnDOT is not required to mitigate for impacts caused by the easement termination, only those impacts resulting from new road alignments. 4.3.4.1 Avoidance and Minimization Efforts have been made during alternatives development and preliminary engineering of the various alternatives to minimize parkland and Section 4(f) properties to the extent possible by following previously disturbed areas (roads, mined lands). According to the DNR, the identified OHVRA parcel impacts are not substantial and are not considered to result in changes to activities, features, or attributes of the recreation area. However, as MnDOT moves forward into more detailed design, opportunities to further minimize the amount of OHVRA land that needs to be acquired for the preferred alternative will be considered. Minor road shifts, steeper side slopes, modified cross section, or trail realignments are potential options that could be considered. RGGS/UTAC and the SLLCRRA have expressed interest in relocating the Mesabi Trail concurrent with the construction of the new alignment to minimize impacts to trail users. MnDOT has assumed a widened right-of-way that includes room for a trail on the east side of Alternatives E-1A and E-2 for evaluation, in the event that the trail sponsor acquires funding for trail relocation. MnDOT will cooperate with both parties to coordinate concurrent trail construction. There is no existing access to the OHVRA east of Landfill Road, and the Iron Range Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area Master Plan Amendment for the Virginia Expansion (January 2010) states that no access to the site will be allowed from the city of Virginia. Access to the School Trust land on the east and west sides of Landfill Road will be coordinated with the DNR for the selected alternative. 4.3.4.2 Mitigation Measures Mitigation measures for the impacts of the preferred alternative on the OHVRA will be refined pending consultation by FHWA with the DNR. 4.4  Cultural Resources  4.4.1  Regulatory Context and Methodology  4.4.1.1  Regulatory Context  The cultural resources survey, evaluation, and effects analysis was conducted in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (as amended) and its implementing regulations, 36 CFR 800. This act requires that impacts to historic properties, defined as those listed in, eligible for listing, or potentially eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), be considered before implementation of a federal undertaking. MnDOT expects to obtain federal funds for the project. Therefore, it is considered a federal undertaking and must comply with the act and its regulations. Section 4(f) (described in Section 4.3.1) may also apply to historic properties. Therefore, an assessment was also made below regarding whether historic properties affected by the project may constitute a Section 4(f) “use.” 4.4.1.2 Methodology The following evaluation of archaeological and architectural resources within the study area is derived from the following four reports, which are incorporated herein by reference and available on the project website:21 ■ Phase I and II Archaeological Investigations for the Trunk Highway 53 Relocation Project, Virginia to Eveleth, St. Louis County, Minnesota (Two Pines Resource Group, LLC, 2012) ■ Phase I and II Architectural History Evaluation for the TH 53 Relocation, Virginia, St. Louis County, Minnesota (Landscape Research, LLC, 2012) ■ Phase I and II Historic Resources Evaluation for the TH 53 Relocation Alternatives E-1A and E-2A, Virginia, St. Louis County, Minnesota (Landscape Research, LLC, 2013) ■ Phase I and II Archaeological Investigations for the Trunk Highway 53 Relocation Project (Alternatives E-1, E-1A, and E-2A), Virginia to Eveleth, St. Louis County, Minnesota (Two Pines Resource Group, LLC, 2013) The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for architectural resources is approximately 450 acres and includes the properties adjacent to portions of the existing US 53 and the Build Alternatives. Where new road construction is proposed, the APE consists of the study area plus approximately ¼ mile in either direction from the centerline. The APE considers direct effects, such as property acquisitions, and indirect effects, including changes in visual qualities and increase in noise levels. Physical, auditory, visual, and atmospheric effects caused by the proposed project to individual properties also includes those to potential mining landscapes. A map of the APE can be found in the Phase I and II Architectural History Evaluation. The APE for archaeological resources was determined by the MnDOT Cultural Resources Unit (CRU), with concurrence from the Minnesota State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), to include the area extending 150 feet on either side of the Alternative M-1 centerline, the area extending 300 feet on either side of the Alternative E-1A centerline, and the area extending 200 feet on either side of the Alternative E-2 centerline. The APE also included the No Build Alternative existing right-of-way and the existing easement agreement area for the Existing US 53 Alternative. The Phase I investigation included literature review and field survey components. During the Phase I survey, all buildings, structures, and landscape features within the APE were viewed by automobile and pedestrian survey. Portions of the APE that were considered to have moderate to high potential for containing archaeological resources were subject to shovel testing. Properties that appeared to be more than 50 years old were recorded on a Minnesota Architecture-History form, on file with SHPO. The initial Phase I properties were evaluated for potential historic significance and integrity based on the four NRHP criteria. Investigations were carried to Phase II, involving intensive literature review, when appropriate. These properties were reviewed by the MnDOT CRU (on behalf of FHWA as the delegated authority) and forwarded to SHPO for concurrence on eligibility (Appendix C). Likewise, CRU also reviewed eligible properties, determined if there were anticipated impacts as a result of the project alternatives, and reviewed with SHPO. 21 http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/TechnicalReports.html 4.4.2 Existing Conditions No architectural or archaeological properties that have been previously determined NRHP-eligible were identified within the APE. Of the 105 architectural properties evaluated during the 2012 Phase I survey, seven properties were carried forward to the Phase II level. Two additional properties were evaluated during the 2013 Phase I survey. One of these properties was carried forward to the Phase II level. The 2012 archaeology report identified one historic site, Rouchleau Shops. The revised archaeological report identified one additional site in the vicinity of Landfill Road and the Mesabi Trail. Table 4.4-1 summarizes these eight architectural and two archaeological properties and the outcome of the final eligibility determination from SHPO. One historic site has been deemed eligible. No other eligible architectural resources or archaeological sites were identified within the APE (Figure 4.4-1). Table 4.4-1. Architectural Properties Evaluated at Phase II Level 5th Avenue Boulevard Historic Resource, Built in 1914 A three-block segment of 5th Avenue West (formerly Central Avenue) is located within the project’s APE. The 5th Avenue segment that is eligible for the NRHP is from 10th to 13th Streets and terminates at a parking lot inside the north boundary of Southside Park (Figure 4.4-1). The paved avenue is 50 feet wide with four 10-foot wide islands of varying lengths placed mid-point in the street. Each grass-covered island has a concrete curb. Seven cast-iron light posts of the type that line the rest of the avenue to the north are placed midpoint in each island. Each light post supports five globes set on a cruciform base with other decorative elements. The present-day view to the south from the foot of the avenue, looking across the park, includes the raised US 53 highway grade (more than 500 feet south of the boulevard), with higher mine stockpiles farther south, and other highway and mine features to the southeast. 4.4.3 Environmental Consequences 4.4.3.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) No construction or improvements would occur under the No Build Alternative; therefore, there would be no impacts to the South 5th Avenue West Boulevard site. 4.4.3.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) No construction would occur under the Existing US 53 Alternative. No impacts to the South 5th Avenue West Boulevard site are anticipated. No other historic resources were identified in this vicinity. 4.4.3.3 Alternative M-1 Improvements to the existing US 53 alignment under Alternative M-1 may be visible from the south end of the South 5th Avenue West Boulevard site. However, the existing and proposed elevations of the roadway in the area visible from the resource would stay the same, resulting in no perceptible visual changes. Additional traffic and an elevation in noise levels are anticipated to occur as a result of the proposed improvements; however, the South 5th Avenue West Boulevard site is located approximately 900 feet away and approximately 20 feet lower in elevation than the roadway, providing enough separation that indirect noise impacts are not anticipated to be a factor. MnDOT made a determination of no adverse effect to the South 5th Avenue West Boulevard site, and SHPO concurred (November 20, 2012 SHPO letter in Appendix C). Given that this resource would not be adversely affected, there would therefore also be no Section 4(f) impact to historic resources. 4.4.3.4 Alternative E-1A Improvements to the existing US 53 alignment under Alternative E-1A may be visible from the south end of the South 5th Avenue West Boulevard site. However, the existing and proposed elevations of the roadway in the area visible from the resource would stay the same with the Intersection Option, resulting in no perceptible visual changes. No difference would be noticed from this location with the Interchange Option at US 53/MN 135. Additional traffic and an elevation in noise levels are anticipated to occur as a result of the proposed improvements; however, the South 5th Avenue West Boulevard site is located approximately 900 feet away and approximately 20 feet lower in elevation than the roadway, providing enough separation that indirect noise impacts are not anticipated to be a factor. MnDOT CRU made a determination of no historic properties affected for Alternative E-1A, and SHPO concurred (see Appendix C). There would therefore also be no Section 4(f) impact to historic resources. 4.4.3.5 Alternative E-2 Improvements proposed under the Alternative E-2 Straight or Curved Setback Options would not be visible or cause other direct or indirect effects upon the South 5th Avenue West Boulevard site. MnDOT CRU made a determination of no historic properties affected for Alternative E-2, and SHPO concurred (see Appendix C). There would also be no Section 4(f) impact to historic resources. 4.4.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures No impacts to NRHP-eligible resources are proposed for any alternative. Therefore, no avoidance, minimization, or mitigation measures would be necessary. 4.5 Land Use The land use characteristics within the project area consist of large mining operations, forested land, wetlands, open space, residential areas, and commercial developments. The area is widely known for iron ore mining, and the existing easement agreement area crosses the UTAC open-pit mine, which extends a distance of about five miles between Virginia and Eveleth. 4.5.1 Existing Conditions 4.5.1.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) Land uses along Co. 7 and MN 37 are primarily characterized by undeveloped and rural residential or commercial properties with direct highway access. The northern portion of the No Build Alternative, along Co. 7 and US 169, includes more dense development within the city of Mountain Iron, including residential, commercial, and institutional land uses. The No Build Alternative passes through the cities of Iron Junction, Mountain Iron, and Virginia. The No Build Alternative is inconsistent with current comprehensive plans for all Quad Cities communities. 4.5.1.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) This portion of US 53, which passes through the operating UTAC Mine, is operated by MnDOT per an easement granted by United States Steel Corporation (now owned by RGGS). 4.5.1.3 Alternative M-1 Alternative M-1 between 2nd Avenue and MN 135 runs through the operating UTAC Mine, in between the Midway commercial and residential neighborhood and a primarily commercial area on the south side of Virginia. Based on known plans, this mining operation will continue to be active for many years. Alternative M-1 mostly follows the grade created by the partially backfilled Auburn Pit. A portion of the Auburn Pit fill accommodates a haul road grade and thus currently functions as a haul route for the mine’s large ore trucks. As the corridor proceeds to the northwest and approaches existing US 53, the lands are undeveloped, wooded/natural areas. 4.5.1.4 Alternative E-1A The eastern portion of Alternative E-1A extends adjacent to the existing US 53 alignment from the Midway neighborhood to the intersection with MN 135. Land uses in the vicinity of the Midway neighborhood are primarily residential and commercial. North of Midway, the E-1A alignment is largely wooded/natural area. The DNR is in the process of developing the Virginia Site of the OHVRA, east of Landfill Road. Current plans for the OHVRA show that the portion of the site closest to the E-1A alignment will not serve as a recreational use area and will remain as it is today. The western portion of the E-1A alignment, including a portion of existing US 53 west of the existing easement agreement area, is characterized by residential and commercial land uses within Virginia. 4.5.1.5 Alternative E-2 For both the Straight and Curved Setback Options, the eastern portion of the alignment extends along and adjacent to the existing US 53 alignment from the Midway neighborhood to the intersection with MN 135. Land uses in the vicinity of the Midway neighborhood are primarily residential and commercial. North of Midway, the E-2 alignment is largely wooded/natural area. The DNR is in the process of developing the Virginia Site of the OHVRA, east of Landfill Road. Current plans for the OHVRA show that the portion of the site closest to the E-2 alignment will not serve as a use area and will remain as it is today. The western portion of the E-2 alignment, including a portion of existing US 53 west of the existing easement agreement area, is characterized by residential and commercial land uses within Virginia. 4.5.2 Land Use Plans This section discusses local land use plans and land use visioning studies for the areas within the project study area, including any reference to US 53 and/or other transportation corridors affected by project alternatives. ■ Laurentian Vision Partnership Design Charrette Summary (October 2001) The Laurentian Vision Partnership, a coalition of government agencies and business partners, has studied land use opportunities surrounding Virginia and the current UTAC mine. As mining activity transitions away from the current location over the long-term (when mining and mine operations are no longer present), the Partnership recognizes an opportunity and a need to plan for future use of the mine area. The first Laurentian Vision Partnership charrette addressed the 500+ acre Auburn Pit. This charrette produced design ideas for these topics: ■ Housing and Community Development: How can the Auburn site provide opportunities for affordable and/or new housing? ■ Economic Development: How can the Auburn site provide Virginia with space needed to attract new businesses? ■ Environmental Systems: How can the mine pit be rebuilt to restore water and habitat systems in a way that reshapes the Quad Cities landscape for future development? Concepts developed during the charrette showed a relocated US 53, aimed at providing “better access into downtown Virginia and to make way for more land.” Concepts for a realigned US 53 were generally in the vicinity of the Auburn Pit or the existing corridor. ■ City of Virginia Comprehensive Plan (December 1997) Virginia is surrounded on three sides by other cities (Gilbert to the east, Eveleth to the south, and Mountain Iron to the west). The proximity of these communities, and the presence of continuing mining activity within the city’s boundaries, means that the amount of land available to develop is drastically limited compared to similarly sized communities that tend to expand on the edges. The city is able to expand into the Midway area; however, there is also pressure to develop existing parklands and wetland areas. As noted in the City’s Comprehensive Plan, “The City has relatively little vacant land available for new residential development that is not comprised by either commercial or industrial uses. This severely limits the City’s ability to accommodate move-up housing for existing residents or those who may wish to move to the City of Virginia from elsewhere” (p. 39). The influence of mining activities on the city’s ability to develop is evidenced by the fact that of the 5,781 acres that compose Virginia, over 3,200 are owned by mines, and another 1,200 acres are used for public roads. ■ City of Eveleth Comprehensive Plan Update (October 2009) This comprehensive plan recommends zoning the entire length of US 53 within Eveleth as Highway Commercial, which “would support economic development by providing visible commercial stores to draw in vehicles from US Highway 53” (p. 36). ■ City of Gilbert Comprehensive Plan and Land Use Plan (February 2000) The City of Gilbert’s Plan indicates that MN 37, in particular the intersection of MN 37 and MN 135, is considered a growth area for the city. Specifically, this intersection was cited as a preferred location for industrial land uses, as well as a limit for downtown expansion. ■ City of Mountain Iron Comprehensive Plan (April 2008) The intersection of US 169 and US 53 is at the heart of Mountain Iron. These two highways “provide residents with connections to neighboring cities and the region at large. They also bring most of the City’s visitors and commercial traffic evidenced by the concentration of most commercial activities within the US 169 and US 53 corridors.” ■ Minnesota DNR Iron Range Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area Master Plan Amendment for the Virginia Expansion) (January 2010) The DNR is developing a 2,700 acre expansion of the existing OHVRA in the eastern portion of Virginia (see Figure 4.3-1 and Appendix F). The Virginia site will be developed exclusively for trail riding for all classes of off-highway vehicles (OHVs) and will link to the 1,200 acre Gilbert site. When completed, the Virginia site will include an approximately 75-mile road/trail system. Land acquisition for the site was completed in April 2012. Development of the full road/trail system is anticipated to take three to five years. In the US 53 project area, the designated OHVRA public recreational use area is located only to the east of Landfill Road. Lands adjacent to and west of Landfill Road are owned by the State of Minnesota but have no specific recreational use designation at this time. 4.5.3 Environmental Consequences This section discusses the compatibility of the project alternatives with the existing land uses and with approved future land use plans for affected areas. Specifically, the consistency of the US 53 alternatives with the development plans identified in adopted, local plans is assessed in this section. 4.5.3.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) The No Build Alternative would not require use of land outside existing highway rights-of-way. However, this alternative would impact planned land uses within parts of the Quad Cities. As described in Section 4.5.2 above, the communities of Virginia, Gilbert, Eveleth, and Mountain Iron incorporate existing US 53 within their land use plans. Both existing and planned land uses, particularly commercial and industrial land uses, are focused on the US 53 corridor within these communities. The rerouting of US 53, primarily along MN 37, Co. 7, and US 169, would shift this important local connection between Virginia and Eveleth, between Virginia and the city’s Midway neighborhood, and between Virginia and Gilbert, to other portions of the Quad Cities. The No Build Alternative would effectively remove the majority of traffic from the existing easement agreement area, thereby substantially reducing the traffic that passes adjacent to Eveleth, Gilbert, the Midway neighborhood, and the southeast corner of Virginia (see Chapter 3: Transportation Analysis for more detail). Complete rerouting of the segment of US 53 on the existing easement agreement area to MN 37, Co. 7, and US 169 would result in a focus on development away from the existing highway. Businesses with frontage and access from existing US 53 in Eveleth, the Midway neighborhood, and the southern parts of Virginia would no longer have the exposure to the high traffic volumes with US 53 rerouted to the west. In Eveleth and the Midway neighborhood, the mix of businesses that are destinations and those that rely on drive-by traffic is fairly evenly split. In the southwest part of Virginia, there are many businesses such as fast food, big box retail, grocery, and gas stations, which rely more on drive-by traffic. For the No Build Alternative, the significant traffic volume decrease along US 53 cannot be avoided due to the traffic pattern changes. Signage for local businesses could alleviate some impact by directing more traffic to specific businesses; however, due to the severity of the traffic change, there is little that can be done to increase traffic volumes near the remnant segments of US 53. Highways that would comprise the No Build Alternative are now primarily characterized by natural, undeveloped, and residential or commercial properties. The addition of roughly 15,000 to 20,000 vehicles per day over portions of the No Build reroute corridors may result in development pressure that could result in intensified land uses that are more commonly found along major arterial highways. 4.5.3.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) Maintaining the existing US 53 alignment would not result in any land use impacts and is therefore consistent with the local land use plans. 4.5.3.3 Alternative M-1 This alternative would introduce a highway corridor into an area that has been or is undergoing mining activity. The land that is required for this alternative is almost entirely owned by RGGS. Given that UTAC plans to continue mining operations on either side of this alignment, little, if any, change is anticipated to occur within the foreseeable future as a result of Alternative M-1 construction. The charrette completed by the Laurentian Vision Partnership in 2001 did include concepts that would realign US 53 in close proximity to the M-1 alignment; however, these concepts have not been adopted by agencies with land use planning authority. These community vision concepts may guide land use planning efforts in the vicinity of the M-1 alignment once mining activities in this area have ceased, which is not anticipated to occur for several decades from the present. Alternative M-1 is not expected to cause significant change in land use within the vicinity of the limits of construction. It is not anticipated to lead to the development of any large scale commercial, industrial, residential, or other development. Local access would be modified with minor changes at 2nd Avenue and MN 135 (see Chapter 2: Alternatives). The project is consistent with local and/or regional comprehensive plans. 4.5.3.4 Alternative E-1A Alternative E-1A would introduce a new transportation corridor in the area northeast and southeast of the existing US 53/MN 135 interchange and through the Rouchleau Pit. In the area northeast of the US 53/MN 135 interchange, the land uses surrounding the E-1A alignment and existing Landfill Road would not change as this land is owned by the State of Minnesota, is part of the OHVRA, and under management by the DNR. Additionally, the presence of the Rouchleau Pit and surrounding mineral resources anticipated to be mined in the future generally limit development potential around this portion of the E-1A alignment. The area west of the Rouchleau Pit and east of 2nd Avenue would be subject to right-of-way acquisition necessary to accommodate the new highway. As described in Section 4.1, three total parcel acquisitions are anticipated in this area. The potential for other land use changes in the 2nd Avenue area is limited, as access would be retained with limited impacts to existing conditions for surrounding properties. Alternative E-1A is not expected to cause noticeable change in land use within the study area. It is not anticipated to lead to the development of any large scale commercial, industrial, residential, or other development. The project is consistent with local and/or regional comprehensive plans. 4.5.3.5 Alternative E-2 Under both the Straight and Curved Setback Options, Alternative E-2 would introduce a new transportation corridor in the area near the existing US 53/MN 135 interchange and through the Rouchleau Pit. In the area northeast of the US 53/MN 135 interchange, the land uses surrounding the E-2 alignment and existing Landfill Road would not change as this land is owned by the State of Minnesota, is part of the OHVRA, and under management by the DNR. Additionally, the presence of the Rouchleau Pit and surrounding mineral resources anticipated to be mined in the future generally limit development potential around this portion of the E-2 alignment. The area west of the Rouchleau Pit and east of 2nd Avenue would be subject to right-of-way acquisition necessary to accommodate the new highway. As described in Section 4.1, two total parcel acquisitions are anticipated in this area. The potential for other land use changes in the 2nd Avenue area is limited, as access would be retained with limited impacts to existing conditions for surrounding properties. Alternative E-2 is not expected to cause noticeable change in land use within the study area. It is not anticipated to lead to the development of any large scale commercial, industrial, residential, or other development. The project is consistent with local and/or regional comprehensive plans. 4.5.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures No mitigation is necessary. 4.6 Environmental Justice 4.6.1 Regulatory Context and Methodology 4.6.1.1 Regulatory Context Executive Order 12898, “Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations,” was issued in February 1994. The purpose of Executive Order 12898 is to identify, address, and avoid disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of federal programs, policies, and activities on minority and low-income populations. The proposed project has federal permit requirements and will receive federal funding. As such, it is considered a federal project for the purpose of compliance with this executive order. Executive Order 12898 requires that the proposed actions be reviewed to determine if there are “disproportionately” high or adverse impacts on these populations. “Disproportionate” is defined in two ways: the impact is “predominantly borne” by the minority or low-income population group, or the impact is “more severe” than that experienced by non-minority or non-low-income populations. FHWA Order 6640.23a, “FHWA Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations,” establishes policies and procedures for FHWA to use in complying with the executive order. 4.6.1.2 Methodology The steps for defining environmental justice impacts include the following: ■ Identification of the location of any low-income population and/or minority population(s) in the study area ■ Identification of the impacts of the project upon the identified potential low-income population and/or minority population ■ Determination of whether or not the impacts are disproportionately high or adverse Land use along the US 53 corridor is predominantly mining land except for development in the cities of Virginia and Eveleth. To gain a better understanding of the demographic composition of the study area, the 2010 Census was reviewed at the census tract and block group level for year 2010 population and racial/ethnic data. The 2008-2012 American Community Survey (ACS) was reviewed at the block group level for household income and size data. According to Executive Order 12898 and the FHWA order on environmental justice, environmental justice populations are defined as “any readily identifiable groups of minority persons or low-income persons who live in geographic proximity, and if circumstances warrant, geographically dispersed/transient persons (such as migrant workers or Native Americans) who will be similarly affected by a proposed FHWA program, policy, or activity.” According to further FHWA direction on conducting environmental justice analysis,22 a minority community is generally defined as one where the minority population is either 10 percentage points higher than the county average; or greater than 50 percent of the total geographic unit; or determined based on input from local officials or stakeholders. St. Louis County has a minority percentage of seven percent, so any block groups higher than 17 percent minority within the study area would be initially identified as containing a minority community and investigated further using local government staff knowledge and other data sources. The FHWA order also defines low-income persons, but there are no specific thresholds for low-income “communities.” The effort to identify groups or clusters of low-income persons (i.e., living in geographic proximity) included review of the best available household income data (adjusted to 2014 dollars) and average household size (from the 2008-2012 ACS as noted above) compared to the US Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) 2014 Poverty Guidelines, an inventory search of affordable housing types including public housing and manufactured home parks, discussion with City management staff familiar with neighborhood makeup in the project area, and public outreach. For purposes of this analysis, the study area was defined as any block group within 200 feet of the alternatives under evaluation. Many of the block groups include existing or past mining areas and are quite large. Review of aerial photography helped to identify where single-family residences, apartment buildings, and manufactured home parks were located. Coordination with the City of Virginia also took place to identify locations of designated low-income housing or areas known to be occupied by communities of specific ethnic groups. 4.6.2 Existing Conditions The first step in the environmental justice determination process was to determine whether any minority and/or low-income populations are present within the study area. 4.6.2.1 Minority Populations The study area encompasses 14 block groups within five census tracts (Figure 4.6-1). Table 4.6-1 summarizes the number of households, total population, and percentage of white and minority persons within the block groups in the study area. None of the 14 block groups in the study area are 10 22 Webinar Series on Environmental Justice: Guidance for Conducting Community Impact Assessments, December 6, 2012, FHWA Office of Human Environment. percentage points or more over the county average for minority populations. Field review and initial discussions with City management staff familiar with neighborhood makeup in the project area did not provide any additional information on the potential for the presence of a minority population adjacent to the project study area. 4.6.2.2 Low-Income Populations Table 4.6-2 provides the household income and size data that was used to determine if any of the 14 block groups in the project area (shown in Figure 4.6-1) met the definition of low income (based on the methodology described in Section 4.6.1.2). None of the block groups were found to have median household incomes below the HHS 2014 poverty guidelines; therefore, no block groups were identified as low income. Coordination with City management staff familiar with neighborhood makeup in the project area, review of aerial photography, and a street-level windshield review of the housing in the project area did not indicate any apparent clustering of low-income areas within these block groups. There are two manufactured home parks located in the study area, both along the No Build Alternative corridor. Briarwood Estates Manufactured Home Park is located along Co. 7, south and west of Virginia. Iron Bowl Manufactured Home Park is located further south along Co. 7, about two miles north of Iron Junction (see Figure 4.6-1). Based on the housing type and field investigation, these manufactured home parks have been determined to be locations of low-income populations for the purposes of this environmental justice analysis. A search of affordable/low-rent housing in the US Department of Housing and Urban Development Database23 revealed three locations within Virginia. None of these locations are in proximity to the proposed alignments. The database indicated one location in Eveleth, which is located along Co. 7/Co. 101 through Eveleth, adjacent to rerouting options for the No Build Alternative (see Figure 4.6-1). The City of Virginia provided a list of an additional 10 low-income housing complexes in Virginia, Eveleth, and Gilbert, none of which are in proximity to the proposed alignments. 4.6.2.3 Outreach Outreach efforts were made during the preparation of this Draft EIS to contact and engage the public, including minority and low-income populations. For the public information meeting held in November 2012, a concerted effort was made to provide notice to environmental justice populations. Meeting flyers were distributed in the Manney Shopper, a free newspaper with wide distribution in the project area. Flyers were also dropped off at local convenience stores along 2nd Avenue in Virginia, an area adjacent to the project. 23 Low-rent apartment search available at http://www.hud.gov/apps/section8/index.cfm (Accessed January 8, 2013) Table 4.6-1.

Mitigation of impacts and offsetting benefits are also considered as part of the environmental justice analysis. Each of the potential impacts and mitigation for those impacts is discussed by alternative below. The determination of whether any adverse impacts, after mitigation, would be “disproportionately borne” by environmental justice populations is presented in Section 4.6.3.6. 4.6.3.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) The No Build Alternative would close the existing easement agreement area of US 53 on the south side of downtown Virginia and near the Midway area. As a result of these closures, traffic would be diverted to existing highways to the south and west, including MN 37, Co. 7, and US 169. The area adjacent to Co. 7 is home to the Briarwood Estates Manufactured Home Park and the Iron Bowl Manufactured Home Park, which are being considered areas of low-income populations for purposes of this analysis. Adjacent to Co. 101 through Eveleth, which is not part of the official No Build reroute, specific low-income housing is identified on McKinley Avenue. By 2024, if UTAC closes Co. 101 west of Eveleth to through traffic, populations on Co. 101 would experience a substantial drop in traffic volumes after 2024. Transportation Access/Travel Time Changes The No Build Alternative would remove direct highway access to all users, including environmental justice populations along Co. 7 and in Eveleth, but would still provide local connections. Access and travel times between communities would also be affected, as documented in Chapter 3: Transportation Analysis and Section 4.7. These changes in access and travel times would affect all residents in the vicinity of the existing US 53 corridor, not just environmental justice populations. Community Cohesion The No Build Alternative does not bisect or otherwise divide identified environmental justice communities. Right-of-Way No new right-of-way acquisition is necessary to implement the No Build Alternative and, therefore, would not impact environmental justice populations. There would be a change in access, which would affect all residents in vicinity of the road closure. Noise Noise would be reduced near the vacated areas of US 53. With increased traffic levels along the proposed reroute, sensitive receptor locations along Co.7, MN 37, and Co. 101 would experience significant (greater than five dBA) noise level increases due to the increase in traffic volumes during both daytime and nighttime hours (up to year 2024) and would drop off if UTAC closes Co. 101 to through traffic. This includes the two manufactured home parks along Co. 7 and low-income housing along Co. 101 through Eveleth. The additional traffic volumes would cause Minnesota noise standards to be exceeded at locations along each of these existing roadways. However, impacts would not be borne primarily by environmental justice populations, but all residents along the reroute would experience increased noise levels. Mitigation for noise impacts could include use of noise barriers in areas where feasible and reasonable, and benefited receptors (homes or other land uses sensitive to noise) would vote on the noise barrier, including those owned or rented by environmental justice residents (see Section 5.7 for a summary of the noise abatement determination process). Construction noise would be mitigated by standard MnDOT mitigation practices. 4.6.3.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) Under this alternative, US 53 would remain in place and open to traffic. There would be no change in the current environment, which includes environmental justice and non-environmental justice populations in the project area. 4.6.3.3 Alternative M-1 Alternative M-1 is located in Census Tract 132, a majority of which is located within mining and undeveloped areas. The northern part of the alignment parallels existing US 53 in Virginia (north of the Auburn Pit) and the Ridgewood neighborhood. No environmental justice populations were identified proximate to this alternative. Transportation Access/Travel Time Changes There are no anticipated impacts to environmental justice populations as a result of Alternative M-1. All residents in the Ridgewood neighborhood, which is adjacent to this alternative and does not have an identified low-income or minority population, may experience a slight decrease in travel times due to shorter road distance, improving connectivity to points south. Therefore, slight benefit to both environmental justice populations and non-environmental justice populations would occur. Community Cohesion Alternative M-1 would not directly bisect or otherwise divide identified environmental justice communities. Right-of-Way No relocations would result from this alternative. The majority of new right-of-way is mining land or undeveloped and would not directly impact environmental justice populations or non-environmental justice populations. Noise Noise levels in the Ridgewood and Midway areas (Areas D, E, and F from Section 5.7) are expected to exceed noise standards at nearby residential receptors. No identified environmental justice populations are present in these areas. Mitigation for noise impacts could include use of noise barriers in areas where feasible and reasonable (i.e., Area F), and benefited receptors (homes or other land uses sensitive to noise) would vote on the noise barrier, including those owned or rented by environmental justice residents (see Section 5.7 for a summary of the noise abatement determination process). Construction noise would be mitigated by standard MnDOT mitigation practices. 4.6.3.4 Alternative E-1A A majority of Alternative E-1A is located in Census Tract 132, a majority of which is located within mining and undeveloped areas. The alignment does approach the eastern edge of the city of Virginia; however, there are no identified concentrations of low-income and/or minority populations located along the proposed alignment, and, according to City management staff familiar with neighborhood makeup in the project area, the area adjacent to the alignment is made up of both environmental justice and non-environmental justice residents. There are no differences in impacts between the Intersection and Interchange Options or the RSS and Bridge Options. Transportation Access/Travel Time Changes There would be longer travel times (two to three minutes) to points south under Alternative E-1A. Both environmental justice and non-environmental justice residents in this neighborhood would be subject to this increase. Community Cohesion Alternative E-1A travels along the edge of the city of Virginia and would not directly bisect or otherwise divide identified environmental justice communities. Right-of-Way This alternative would result in the removal of up to two commercial parcels, one located at the northwest corner of US 53/2nd Avenue and one located south of MN 135 along Bourgin Road. These businesses are not essential contributors to the identity and/or cohesion of an environmental justice community. The owners will be compensated according to the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act (Uniform Act) of 1970. Noise With the new roadway alignment and increased traffic levels, noise levels are expected to exceed state standards at all residences within Block Group 131-1 that are located directly adjacent to the new highway alignment, as well as one block away (Area C from Section 5.7) and in the Midway neighborhood (Areas F and G from Section 5.7). No environmental justice populations were identified proximate to this alternative. Mitigation for noise impacts could include use of noise barriers in areas where feasible and reasonable (i.e., Area F), and benefited receptors (homes or other land uses sensitive to noise) would vote on the noise barrier, including those owned or rented by environmental justice residents (see Section 5.7 for a summary of the noise abatement determination process). Construction noise would be mitigated by standard MnDOT mitigation practices. 4.6.3.5 Alternative E-2 A majority of Alternative E-2 is located in Census Tract 132, a majority of which is located within mining and undeveloped areas. The alignment does approach the eastern edge of the city of Virginia; however, there are no identified concentrations of low-income and/or minority populations located along the proposed alignment, and, according to City management staff familiar with neighborhood makeup in the project area, the area adjacent to the alignment is made up of both environmental justice and non-environmental justice residents. There are no differences in impacts between the Intersection and Interchange Options or the Straight and Curved Setback Options. Transportation Access/Travel Time Changes Both environmental justice and non-environmental justice residents in the neighborhoods adjacent to the alignment may be subject to longer travel times (one to two minutes) to points south with the implementation of Alternative E-2. Community Cohesion Alternative E-2 travels along the edge of the city of Virginia and would not directly bisect or otherwise divide identified environmental justice communities. Right-of-Way This alternative would result in the removal of one commercial parcel located at the northwest corner of US 53/2nd Avenue. This business is not an essential contributor to the identity and/or cohesion of an environmental justice community. The owner will be compensated according to the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act (Uniform Act) of 1970. Noise With the new roadway alignment and increased traffic levels, noise levels are expected to exceed state standards at all residences within Block Group 131-1 (Area C from Section 5.7) that are located directly adjacent to the new highway alignment, as well as one block away for both the Straight and Curved Setback Options. With the Curved Setback Option, the Midway neighborhood (Areas F and G from Section 5.7) would also exceed state standards. No environmental justice populations were identified proximate to this alternative. Mitigation for noise impacts could include use of noise barriers in areas where feasible and reasonable (i.e., Area C and, with the Curved Setback Option, Area F), and benefited receptors (homes or other land uses sensitive to noise) would vote on the noise barrier, including those owned or rented by environmental justice residents (see Section 5.7 for a summary of the noise abatement determination process). Construction noise would be mitigated by standard MnDOT mitigation practices. 4.6.3.6 Determination of Disproportionately High or Adverse Impacts If any adverse impacts remain after mitigation is considered, then a determination must be made whether those effects are disproportionately high and adverse with respect to minority and/or low-income populations. After considering mitigation, remaining adverse impacts would include: ■ No Build Alternative: substantial access, travel time, and noise impacts ■ Alternative M-1: unmitigated noise impacts at Areas D and E ■ Alternative E-1A: unmitigated noise impacts at Areas C and G ■ Alternative E-2 Curved Setback Option: unmitigated noise impacts at Area G “Disproportionate” is defined in two ways: the impact is “predominantly borne” by the minority or low-income population group, or the impact is “more severe” than that experienced by non-minority or nonlow-income populations. Impacts related to access and travel times would be borne by both environmental justice populations and non-environmental justice populations. Travel time impacts are not disproportionate to environmental justice populations for any of the alternatives. None of the Build Alternatives require substantial residence or business acquisitions. No environmental justice populations would be directly affected by property acquisition or physical division of or barriers to defined communities. Right-of-way impacts are not disproportionate to environmental justice populations, and no community cohesion impacts are anticipated. Environmental justice populations were identified only adjacent to the No Build Alternative. Residents and businesses that may be affected by traffic noise are located along the entire No Build Alternative. Specific noise mitigation was not evaluated for the No Build Alternative; therefore, it is unknown which areas would continue to be impacted after mitigation. If noise impacts remained adverse after mitigation, those impacts would not be disproportionately borne by environmental justice populations as the entire corridor would experience similar impacts. 4.6.3.7 Environmental Justice Finding Based on the available data, low-income populations were identified in the study area along the No Build Alternative; however, none were identified within the potential impact area of the Build Alternatives. Residents of the manufactured home parks located along the No Build Alterative would be impacted by the project if it were selected as the preferred alternative, but no disproportionately high and adverse impacts are anticipated. 4.6.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures There would be no disproportionately high or adverse effects to environmental justice populations due to this project; therefore, no mitigation is required. 4.7 Social, Neighborhood, and Community Facility Impacts 4.7.1 Regulatory Context and Methodology Connectivity between the five area communities and associated community facilities and services was evaluated to determine if any alternatives would impact functionality, connectivity, and/or emergency response times. 4.7.2 Existing Conditions The St. Louis County communities within the project area include the Quad Cities of Virginia, Eveleth, Gilbert, and Mountain Iron, plus Leonidas. Public resources in these cities include schools, libraries, parks, recreational areas, police and fire stations, and medical facilities (Figure 4.7-1). 4.7.2.1 Virginia There are two notable neighborhoods that are part of Virginia but have some separation from the main center of Virginia by US 53: the Ridgewood neighborhood south of US 53 and west of the Auburn Pit; and the Midway neighborhood east of the Auburn Pit. These neighborhoods are directly connected to the city center by the existing easement agreement area. The area of Virginia north of US 53 is referred to here as downtown Virginia as it encompasses the bulk of the city and the historic city center. Schools and Libraries Independent School District (ISD) 706 serves the city of Virginia. The three schools that are part of ISD 706 include Roosevelt Elementary School, Virginia High School, and Parkview Learning Center. Other schools located within the city limits of Virginia include Mesabi Range Community and Technical School, East Range Academy of Technology and Science, and East Range Secondary Technical Center. All schools and learning centers are located within the downtown area of the city, except the East Range Academy of Technology and Science which is located near the Midway neighborhood. The Virginia Public Library is located north of the high school. Parks and Recreational Areas Five parks and recreational facilities are located within the city limits of Virginia. All of these features are located north of US 53. The Virginia Municipal Golf Course is located on the north side of the downtown area and the parks are scattered throughout. Emergency Services and Medical Facilities The Virginia Police Department and Fire Department are both located near the downtown area of the city. The paramedics at the Virginia Fire Department have five advanced life support ambulances that serve a 650 square mile area.24 This fire department assists the communities of Gilbert, Leonidas, and Mountain Iron. Virginia is also home to Essentia Health-Virginia, the main trauma center and hospital within the region. Essentia Health-Virginia is located on 9th Street on the north side of Virginia. 4.7.2.2 Eveleth Schools and Libraries ISD 2154, which includes four schools, serves the cities of Eveleth, Gilbert, and Leonidas. Two of the four schools, Franklin Elementary and Eveleth-Gilbert High School, are located in Eveleth, as is the Mesabi Range Community and Technical School. Eveleth has a public library that is located north of Franklin Elementary School. 24 City of Virginia’s website: http://www.virginiamn.us/department/fire_department/index.php (accessed August 28, 2014) Parks and Recreational Areas Eveleth has three parks: Northside Park, Monroe Park, and Southside Park. The city also houses the Range Recreation Civic Center and the Eveleth Hippodrome. Emergency Services and Medical Facilities The police force, volunteer fire department, and paid-on-call ambulance service25 are housed near downtown Eveleth. No major medical facilities exist within the city limits. 4.7.2.3 Gilbert Schools and Libraries The city of Gilbert has two schools: Nelle Shean Elementary and Eveleth-Gilbert Junior High. Both schools are part of ISD 2154. As noted above, this district includes a total of four schools and serves the cities of Eveleth, Gilbert, and Leonidas. The Gilbert Public Library is located in the northern part of the city. Parks and Recreational Areas One park and one recreational area are located within Gilbert. These include Hopkins Park and the Gilbert Unit of the OHVRA. Emergency Services and Medical Facilities Gilbert has a police force and a fire department located in the northern area of the city. The City of Virginia’s medical response team services Gilbert and Virginia concurrently. No major medical facilities exist within the city. 4.7.2.4 Mountain Iron Schools and Libraries ISD 712 serves the cities of Mountain Iron, Buhl, and Kinney. Two of the district’s three schools are located in Mountain Iron: Mountain Iron-Buhl High School and Merritt Elementary School. The city’s public library is located downtown. Parks and Recreational Areas Ten parks are scattered throughout Mountain Iron. Emergency Services and Medical Facilities Mountain Iron does not have a police or fire department. The St. Louis County Sheriff’s department provides law enforcement services for the city, and the City of Virginia’s fire department and emergency response teams cover Mountain Iron. 4.7.2.5 Leonidas Schools and Libraries ISD 2154 serves the city of Leonidas. No schools are located within the city limits; the city is served by schools in Eveleth and Gilbert. Parks and Recreational Areas One recreational facility, the Leonidas Community Center, is located in Leonidas. Emergency Services and Medical Facilities Leonidas does not have a police or fire department. These services are provided by the City of Eveleth’s police and fire departments. 25 City of Eveleth’s website: http://www.evelethmn.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC=%7B33D49EAA-4795-4C82-B42E6617CAC436BB%7D 4.7.3 Environmental Consequences Anticipated impacts of the various alternatives are discussed below and summarized in Table 4.7-1. Because the impacts of the Build Alternatives and their respective options do not present distinguishable differences regarding social impacts, they are combined for purposes of this discussion. Additional information on travel times between the communities can be found in Section 3.1. Table 4.7-1. Impacts to Social, Neighborhood, and Community Facilities By Alternative Cities  No Build  Alternatives Existing Build Alternatives (M 1, E 1A, and E 2) US 53  Virginia  Removal of direct connection between Midway and downtown Virginia  No impact  Similar connection between the city’s downtown area and the Midway area and other surrounding communities  School buses rerouted through Eveleth, Leonidas, and Mountain Iron, greatly increasing trip length  ISD 706 bus routes modified to accommodate the different connection point between the two sections of US 53, but overall no major connectivity issues anticipated  Emergency response times lengthened 9 to 21 minutes depending on destination  Change in emergency response between Virginia downtown and Ridgewood sections to Midway and the surrounding communities would be minimal (less than 3 minutes)  Time needed to get from the downtown and Ridgewood sections of Virginia to Gilbert, Eveleth, and Leonidas would be lengthened 6.5 to 21 minutes depending on destination  Access improvement at 2nd Avenue would provide a better access for emergency response to transport from the Midway area to Essentia Health-Virginia; compared to the existing travel time, the trip would take an additional 3.5 minutes or less  Eveleth, Gilbert  Removal of direct connection to Virginia’s downtown area  No impact  Similar direct connection to Virginia’s downtown and Ridgewood areas  No impact to bus movements for ISD 2154 between Eveleth, Gilbert, and Leonidas  No impact to bus movements for ISD 2154 between Eveleth, Gilbert, and Leonidas  Increased travel time of fire and emergency response to Essentia Health-Virginia and the city of Virginia (9 to 21 minutes)  Access improvement at 2nd Avenue would maintain access for emergency response/ transport to Essentia Health-Virginia  Mountain Iron  Impacts connection between Mountain Iron (US 169) and the Midway area of Virginia with travel time increases similar to those for Eveleth and Virginia  No impact  Connection between the US 169 area of Mountain Iron and the Midway area of Virginia would increase travel time by 3 minutes or less  No impact to bus movements for ISD 712 between Mountain Iron, Buhl, and Kinney  No impact to bus movements for ISD 712 between Mountain Iron, Buhl, and Kinney  No impact to movement of fire and emergency response between the Virginia and Mountain Iron  No impact on fire and emergency response between the Virginia and Mountain Iron  Cities  No Build  Alternatives Existing Build Alternatives (M 1, E 1A, and E 2) US 53  Leonidas  Result in route change between Leonidas and Virginia (increased travel time and distance) with travel time increases similar to those for Eveleth and Virginia  No impact  Provides similar connection to downtown and Ridgewood Virginia, with small increase (3 minutes or less) in travel time  No impact to ISD 2154 bus movements between Eveleth and Leonidas  No impact to bus movements for ISD 2154 between Eveleth, Gilbert, and Leonidas  Emergency response travel time between Leonidas and Essentia Health-Virginia may increase due to congestion  Access improvement at 2nd Avenue would maintain access for emergency response/ transport to Essentia Health-Virginia  4.7.3.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) Virginia The No Build Alternative would remove the direct connection between the Midway neighborhood and Virginia’s downtown and Ridgewood areas. This would result in a longer trip between Midway and downtown Virginia because drivers would need to travel around the mining operations along the designated routes. Even local “cut-through” routes on Co. 101 through Eveleth would take longer and were assumed to be eliminated by 2024 if UTAC closes Co. 101. ISD 706 busing would also be rerouted through different school districts in Eveleth, Leonidas, and Mountain Iron in order to transport students between downtown Virginia and the Midway area. Connections between the recreational areas and the parks would be hindered and longer commutes would be needed to provide access to these facilities between Virginia and the Midway area. Movements of police, fire, and emergency response would be hindered due to the loss of direct connectivity between these sections of Virginia. Eveleth The No Build Alternative would remove the direct connection between Eveleth and Virginia. This alternative would not impact the bus movements for ISD 2154 between Eveleth, Gilbert, and Leonidas. The No Build Alternative would increase travel time of emergency response between Eveleth and Essentia Health-Virginia. Gilbert The No Build Alternative would remove the direct connection between Gilbert and Virginia’s downtown area. This alternative would not impact the bus movements for ISD 2154 between Eveleth, Gilbert, and Leonidas but would increase travel time of emergency response between Gilbert and Virginia. Mountain Iron The No Build Alternative would impact the connection between Mountain Iron (US 169 area) and the Midway area of Virginia. This alternative would not impact the bus movements for ISD 712 between Mountain Iron, Buhl, and Kinney. It also would not impact the movement of fire and emergency response between the Virginia and Mountain Iron, as the fire and emergency response stations are located within Virginia, north of US 53. Leonidas The No Build Alternative would remove the direct connection between Leonidas and Virginia. This alternative would not impact the bus movements for ISD 2154 between Eveleth, Gilbert, and Leonidas. The alternative would impact the movement of emergency response between Leonidas and Essentia Health-Virginia. 4.7.3.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) The Existing US 53 Alternative would not impact the connectivity of any neighborhood or community facilities within Virginia, Eveleth, Gilbert, Mountain Iron, or Leonidas. 4.7.3.3 Build Alternatives (M-1, E-1A, and E-2) Virginia The Build Alternatives and their respective options would provide a connection similar to the existing one between the downtown/Ridgewood areas and the Midway neighborhood. The intersection at 2nd Avenue would be modified to an at-grade, full access intersection (for Alternative M-1 access to 2nd Avenue is provided via the new Southern Drive intersection). ISD 706 bus routes would be modified to accommodate the different connection point between the two sections of US 53, but, overall, no major connectivity issues are anticipated. The change in fire and police response to the Midway section of the city would be minimal due to the location of the alternatives in relation to the existing US 53 alignment. The full access improvements at 2nd Avenue and the location of the northern connection to existing US 53 would maintain access for emergency response to transport from the Midway neighborhood to Essentia Health-Virginia. Eveleth The Build Alternatives and their respective options would not change the direct connection between Eveleth and Virginia’s downtown/Ridgewood areas. These alternatives would not impact the bus movements for ISD 2154 between Eveleth, Gilbert, and Leonidas. The full access improvements at 2nd Avenue and the location of the connection to existing US 53 would maintain access for emergency response to transport from Eveleth to Essentia Health-Virginia. Gilbert The Build Alternatives and their respective options would not change the direct connection between Gilbert and Virginia’s downtown/Ridgewood areas. These alternatives would not impact the bus movements for ISD 2154 between Eveleth, Gilbert, and Leonidas. The full access improvements at 2nd Avenue and the location of the connection to existing US 53 would provide better access for emergency response to transport from Gilbert to Essentia Health-Virginia. Mountain Iron The Build Alternatives and their respective options would not impact the connection between the US 169 area of Mountain Iron and the Midway neighborhood of Virginia. These alternatives would not impact the bus movements for ISD 712 between Mountain Iron, Buhl, and Kinney. These alternatives would not impact the movement of fire and emergency response between Virginia and Mountain Iron, as the fire and emergency response stations are located within the downtown area of Virginia. Leonidas Alternatives would not remove the direct connection between Leonidas and Virginia’s downtown area. Alternatives would not impact the bus movements for ISD 2154 between Eveleth, Gilbert, and Leonidas. The change at 2nd Avenue and the location of connecting the existing US 53 in the downtown area would provide better access for emergency response to transport from Leonidas to Essentia Health-Virginia. 4.7.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures 4.7.4.1 Avoidance and Minimization The alternative expected to have the greatest impact to community facilities and social or neighborhood connectivity is the No Build Alternative. However, since the impact is due to the length of the reroute, there are limited or no potential avoidance, minimization, or mitigation strategies available. The remaining alternatives would have little to no impact on community facilities or social or neighborhood connectivity. Appropriate signage would be added for any alternative chosen. New bus routes would be determined for the three different school districts and the fire, police, and emergency response routes would be modified for the different communities and their connections to Essentia Health-Virginia. 4.7.4.2 Mitigation Measures No further mitigation is required. 4.8 Visual and Aesthetic Impacts 4.8.1 Regulatory Context and Methodology The visual quality analysis is based on the MnDOT Visual Impact Assessment framework which considers the project location, visual resources, and user groups to assess the level of visual quality impacts and need for mitigation. The assessment of visual quality impacts was based on the identification of visual resources, or the objects which compose the project environment. Visual resources are potentially affected if they can be seen from the proposed highway or if the proposed highway would be seen from them. Visual resources were identified in three categories: natural environment, cultural environment, and highway environment. Potential impacts to these resources were then identified according to viewers: those who are neighbors, or occupants of lands adjacent to the project; and those who are travelers, or users of the proposed project. 4.8.2 Existing Conditions The description of the affected environment for each alternative considered natural, cultural, and highway environments. The dominant features in the study area within each of these categories are summarized below, followed by a discussion of resources by alternative. Natural Environment ■ Natural wetlands, open space, and forest habitat ■ Rouchleau Pit – a large water reservoir visible from select locations at the edge of Virginia and from Mineview in the Sky as a deep pit with the water surface markedly below the top of the pit walls Cultural Environment ■ Midway neighborhood/Eveleth and Ridgewood area – developed residential areas ■ Virginia US 53 commercial corridor – developed commercial areas ■ UTAC mine – existing mining operations south of Virginia, also known as “Auburn Pit” ■ Mineview in the Sky – a viewing platform open to the public, offering views of the surrounding environment ■ OHVRA – primarily wooded lands to the east of Landfill Road where trails are planned to be available for motorized vehicle use Highway Environment ■ Existing roadways 4.8.2.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) Natural The No Build Alternative area has generally flat topography along the designated reroute roadways, with a mix of deciduous and coniferous forested areas alternating with wetlands and open pasture agricultural lands. This route provides no views of the Rouchleau Pit. Cultural Primary cultural features of the No Build Alternative are rural residential and commercial properties visible from the corridor. The northern portion (near US 169) of the No Build Alternative reroute also includes a more densely developed portion of Mountain Iron, where city streets, residential and commercial development, and electrical transmission lines run adjacent to the route. This route provides no views of the US 53 strip commercial area (Thunderbird Mall area), UTAC mine, Mineview in the Sky, or OHVRA features. Highway The No Build reroute is characterized by a two-lane rural highway cross section. As the Co. 7 corridor proceeds to the north in Mountain Iron, curb and gutter is present near the US 169 corridor, which is a four-lane highway with an open grass median. Three at-grade railroad crossings are located within the No Build corridor. 4.8.2.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) Natural Within the existing easement agreement area, the existing US 53 corridor slopes downhill from Cuyuna Drive in the Midway area to the 2nd Avenue interchange in Virginia. The viewshed in this corridor is dominated by vegetated slopes and tree lines. The northern portion of the existing easement agreement area is marked by a transition from tree-lined corridor to open space where the surrounding environment is more visible. For southbound travelers from Virginia to Eveleth, the disturbed environment of the UTAC mine is visible. Vegetated stockpiles of mine tailings limit views into the open pit mine. The Rouchleau Pit, a water reservoir immediately north of US 53, is not visible from the highway corridor. Cultural For northbound US 53 travelers, the existing US 53 Alternative corridor is the primary entryway into Virginia. Big box retail, gas stations, and related commercial structures come into view. Immediately north of, and accessed by, the existing easement agreement area is Mineview in the Sky, a privately-owned viewing platform open to the public. Perched on top of an earthen embankment, Mineview in the Sky offers views of the surrounding environment, including downtown Virginia, the Rouchleau Pit water reservoir to the north, US 53, and the disturbed, operating mine environment to the south. Highway This portion of US 53 is marked by the interchange with MN 135. Trees fill the open spaces of this interchange, obstructing the viewshed of the highway corridor. The northern portion of this segment is marked by a four-lane rural section highway with a grassy median. 4.8.2.3 Alternative M-1 Natural Alternative M-1 is routed through the operating UTAC mine. This open-pit mine is the dominant environmental feature of the corridor, which would not be a noticeably different view from that from the existing easement agreement area. Cultural As a symbol of the Iron Range economy and an important part of the regional economy, the UTAC mine is part of the cultural environment. The north end of the M-1 alignment enters the US 53 commercial corridor and would provide similar views as the existing corridor. The views of and from the residential and commercial areas and Mineview in the Sky would not change the perception of these features. Highway No public roadways currently exist in the M-1 corridor. The new four-lane roadway would be on a narrower cross section than the existing segment. The northbound lanes of existing US 53 would be used to maintain two-lane connections to 2nd Avenue in Virginia and to MN 135. 4.8.2.4 Alternative E-1A Natural The Alternative E-1A affected environment is characterized by an undulating landscape with deciduous forests. Neighboring lands have been disturbed by past mining activity; vegetation in this area is in the early stages of regeneration. The Rouchleau Pit is a large water reservoir visible from select locations at the edge of Virginia and from Mineview in the Sky as a deep pit with the water surface markedly below the top of the pit walls. Cultural Neighboring lands surrounding 2nd Avenue at the west end of Alternative E-1A are primarily residential and commercial. The topography and vegetation in this area currently prohibit views between US 53 and the developed parcels. The Rouchleau Pit is a remnant of past mine operations. As such, the pit is reflective of Virginia’s mining history. Neighboring lands to the south of the pit are within the existing easement agreement area, which is subject to planned future mining operations. Lands to the east of Landfill Road have been managed for an expansion of the OHVRA, where trails are planned to be available for motorized vehicle use. Highway Some of the new four-lane roadway would be on a narrower cross section than the existing segment, particularly across the Rouchleau Pit (four lanes with two foot median barrier). The Alternative E-1A environment is marked on either end with existing interchanges at 2nd Avenue and MN 135. 4.8.2.5 Alternative E-2 Natural The Alternative E-2 affected environment is characterized by an undulating landscape with deciduous forests and includes a portion of the Landfill Road corridor. Neighboring lands have been disturbed by past mining activity; vegetation in this area is in the early stages of regeneration. The Rouchleau Pit is a large water reservoir visible from select locations at the edge of Virginia and from Mineview in the Sky as a deep pit with the water surface markedly below the top of the pit walls. Cultural Neighboring lands surrounding 2nd Avenue at the west end of Alternative E-2 are primarily residential and commercial. The topography and vegetation in this area currently prohibit views between US 53 and the developed parcels. The Rouchleau Pit is a remnant of past mine operations. As such, the pit is reflective of Virginia’s mining history. Neighboring lands to the south of the pit are within the existing easement agreement area, which is subject to planned future mining operations. Lands to the east of Landfill Road have been managed for an expansion of the OHVRA, where trails are planned to be available for motorized vehicle use. Highway Landfill Road is a two-lane road corridor with drainage ditches on either side. Some of the new four-lane roadway would be on a narrower cross section than the existing segment. The Alternative E-2 environment is marked on either end with existing interchanges at 2nd Avenue and MN 135. 4.8.3 Environmental Consequences Visual impacts are the perceived changes in visual quality of an existing scene. The discussion of visual impacts for each alternative is structured according to the three environments used in the description of existing conditions above: natural environment, cultural environment, and highway environment. MnDOT guidance for assessing the degree of visual impact provides three criteria that may be used: ■ Value of a visual impact (beneficial, adverse, or unchanged) ■ Scale of impact (minor or major) ■ Extent of impact (localized or widespread) 4.8.3.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) Natural The No Build Alternative does not require additional right-of-way or the construction of new roadway or related equipment. Therefore, the visual quality impacts for views from neighboring properties would be unchanged. Cultural Neighbors of existing US 53 would notice no change to the existing scene. Through travelers on US 53 would no longer view Virginia business areas or landmarks (including Mineview in the Sky viewing platform). Highway Changes to the visual environment that would occur in the No Build corridor include replacement signing for the conversion of existing state and county roads to the US 53 designation. The two-lane corridor that would be used for the No Build Alternative represents a change in highway design (versus the four lanes on the rest of the corridor) for travelers of US 53. These are minor impacts that are neither beneficial nor adverse. However, views of traffic congestion would increase from adjacent properties. 4.8.3.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) No impacts result from this alternative, which retains all existing features of US 53. 4.8.3.3 Alternative M-1 Natural There would be no impacts to natural environment resources. Cultural The most notable impact to cultural environment would be a minor change in views of the UTAC mine from US 53. For northbound US 53 travelers, the US 53 commercial corridor would become more apparent upon the approach into Virginia from Midway. Based on public comments received during Scoping, this new view into the mine would be considered a beneficial impact for some viewers from the highway. Minor changes in land access for connections to 2nd Avenue and MN 135 would have minimal visual impact to or from US 53. The section of Alternative M-1 over the mine would include an elevated tunnel to mitigate potential mine business and operational risk impacts as a result of mine air quality requirements, and to reduce exposure of road users to exceedances in particulate matter (PM10). The use of an elevated tunnel would inhibit views of the mine from the highway and would limit views approaching the US 53 commercial corridor. Highway An assumed constrained cross section, including median barriers, for US 53 through the UTAC mine would have a minor impact on views of the highway environment for users of US 53. An elevated tunnel option would also change the views of the highway environment. 4.8.3.4 Alternative E-1A Natural Crossing the Rouchleau pit would represent a minor change to that existing scene, as there are few views of the scene available currently. The exception would be from the Mineview in the Sky platform, where the pit crossing, under the RSS Option or the Bridge Option, would represent a change to the visual setting by introducing a bridge or fill section across the Rouchleau Pit. Open lands to the east of the pit would also have views of the new highway corridor. There would be view changes resulting from impacts to the open space area east of the pit, due to proposed local roadway connections on the new alignment. Cultural By retaining existing access location points at 2nd Avenue and MN 135, there are no impacts to views of and from the adjacent residential and commercial areas of US 53, with the exception of interchange bridges for the Interchange Option. Highway An assumed constrained cross section, including median barriers and barriers on both sides of the roadway, for US 53 through the Rouchleau Pit would have a minor, localized impact on views of the highway environment for users of US 53. The lower elevation of the RSS Option would give users a lower perspective through the pit than the Bridge Option. A short segment of Landfill Road would also need to be shifted east due to elevation differences between it and the new US 53 alignment, slightly changing the visual environment. The Intersection Option at US 53/MN 135 would result in less pavement than exists today. The Interchange Option at US 53/MN 135 would result in similar pavement area as today but with a new configuration that otherwise follows a similar alignment and would not result in a substantial change as compared to the Intersection Option. This alternative shifts east of the US 53 alignment providing increased views of forests, wetlands, and rock cut areas. 4.8.3.5 Alternative E-2 Natural Crossing the Rouchleau pit would represent a minor change to that existing scene, as there are few views of the scene available currently. The exception would be from the Mineview in the Sky platform, where the pit crossing would represent a change to the visual setting. Open lands to the east of the pit would also have views of the new highway corridor and the large bridge structure spanning the pit. Cultural By retaining existing access location points at 2nd Avenue and MN 135, there are no impacts to views of and from the adjacent residential and commercial areas of US 53. Highway An assumed constrained cross section, including median barriers and barriers on both sides of the roadway, for US 53 through the Rouchleau Pit would have a minor, localized impact on views of the highway environment for users of US 53. The Intersection Option at US 53/MN 135 would result in less pavement than exists today. The Interchange Option at US 53/MN 135 would result in similar pavement area as today but with a new configuration that otherwise follows a similar alignment and would not result in a substantial change as compared to the Intersection Option. The Straight Option would have similar views along US 53, south of MN 135. The Curved Setback Option shifts east of the US 53 alignment, providing increased views of forests, wetlands, and rock cut areas. 4.8.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures Mitigation of visual impacts was incorporated into the alignment and design of the proposed alternatives to avoid or minimize adverse visual impacts, resulting in relatively minor visual impacts as described in the previous section. No mitigation of minor adverse impacts is necessary. MnDOT will develop visual quality guidelines for the project and take input from a Visual Quality Review Committee (VQRC). The guidelines will cover many aspects of project design including bridge features (such as pier shapes, bridge abutment surfaces, and railings), retaining walls, roadways, grading, slope protection, barriers, lightning, signage, vegetation, and miscellaneous elements that would affect aesthetics that may be identified. Aesthetic decisions will also be informed by engineering analyses and other technical reviews and by setting constraints (e.g., access, relation to mine operations, height over water). The visual quality guidelines will become a resource for project designers during final design so that aesthetic decisions and strategies are carried forward faithfully. No Build Alternative The No Build Alternative minimizes visual impacts by using existing highway corridors. However, the US 53 traveler would have a changed experience, from existing four-lane to two-lane within the US 53 reroute segment. Existing US 53 Alternative The Existing US 53 Alternative avoids impacts by retaining use of all existing roads. Alternative M-1 This route minimizes impacts to the natural environment by using a disturbed open pit mine corridor. Localized impacts to the visual setting at local connections result in an unchanged setting that minimizes impacts. The use of an elevated tunnel would have a moderate impact on the visual environment in this area, by providing more of a barrier and inhibiting views from the roadway and of the roadway. Alternative E-1A The local visual impacts caused by modifications to the local connections at 2nd Avenue and MN 135 are minimized due to the reuse of existing US 53 alignment in those areas. Alternative E-2 Localized impacts to open space east of the Rouchleau Pit are minimized by using the Landfill Road corridor. The local visual impacts caused by modifications to the local connections at 2nd Avenue and MN 135 are minimized due to the reuse of existing US 53 alignment in those areas. 750 1,500 Feet ±0 Source: USGS Aerial 2011 Figure 4.1-1 LegendAlternative M-1 Existing Mesabi Trail Alternative M-1 Alternative M-1 Proposed Right-Existing Public Recreation Land Proposed Right-of-Way Limits of-Way Limits Existing US 53 Easement Existing School Trust Land US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth Agreement Area Draft Environmental Impact Statement Note: Intersection Option shown.

These “areas of evaluation” were defined based on general design assumptions, estimated construction limits, potential additional right-of-way needed for stormwater management and other related transportation functions, and other design factors. Staging areas, if needed outside the areas of evaluation, will be identified for the preferred alternative and evaluated in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). For the No Build Alternative, the area evaluated includes the existing right-of-way of the reroute roads. For the Existing US 53 Alternative, the area evaluated includes the existing right-of-way/easement agreement area of existing US 53. The Alternative M-1 area of evaluation represents the assumed alignment for that alternative and extends to the estimated limits of construction. The area of evaluation was widened for Alternatives E-1A and E-2 in areas where there is potential for design adjustments in the alignment to accommodate currently undefined solutions to known engineering challenges (e.g., existing areas of unstable fill and bridge type). The intent of evaluating the wider area for Alternatives E-1A and E-2 was to identify potential impacts and determine if there were any environmental resources that could limit implementation of the design options being considered. As determined by analysis of aerial photography and data collection within the widened areas of evaluation across the Rouchleau Pit for Alternatives E-1A and E-2, there is generally consistent vegetation/cover types (i.e., mostly forested with some wetlands, or rock pit walls and water) and no existing development or noise receptors. Since most of the widened area is within the previously mined area in and adjacent to the Rouchleau Pit, the alignment adjustments should result in little difference in impacts to resources except for ferrous resources and right-of-way. Impacts to vegetation and wetlands were determined to be similar regardless of where the final alignment would be oriented within the widened area. To calculate potential impacts without overestimating them due to the widened area of evaluation, a corridor averaging 200400 feet wide was assumed for Alternative E-1A, and a corridor averaging 150-300 feet wide was assumed for Alternative E-2 (the Alternative E-1A RSS Option requires a larger footprint). 5.1 Utilities The objective of this section is to use currently available information to evaluate the potential impacts to existing utilities from each project alternative. This section includes: ■ The public and private utilities potentially impacted by the project ■ The general service area for these utilities ■ The utilities’ proposed approaches to relocation 5.1.1 Regulatory Context and Methodology 5.1.1.1 Regulatory Context The utilities described in this section are located within the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) US 53 right-of-way corridor, which includes the highway’s existing easement agreement area on lands owned by RGGS. The utilities are located within US 53 right-of-way by way of revocable permits issued by MnDOT. The applicable terms of all such permits make each utility responsible for costs and management of its facilities along the highway, including within the RGGS-owned existing easement agreement area. Therefore, MnDOT and RGGS are under no obligation to provide for utility relocations or other accommodations. However, MnDOT must provide adequate notification to utilities to prepare for needed relocations. The typical relocation policy of MnDOT involves accommodating utilities within its road rights-of-way, via a revocable permit, when feasible. 5.1.1.2 Methodology The study area for utilities includes the existing easement agreement area/right-of-way of US 53 and roadways that would be designated as the US 53 reroute for the No Build Alternative. It also includes the areas within and directly adjacent to the Alternative M-1, E-1A, and E-2 corridors. 5.1.2 Existing Conditions There are two public and four private utility operators located within the existing easement agreement area of the US 53 corridor right-of-way. Each has a permit from MnDOT to locate their respective utilities within the US 53 existing easement agreement area. Some of these utilities are also located within the MN 37, Co. 7, and Co. 101 corridors that make up the No Build Alternative reroute for traffic. Northeast Services Cooperative is one utility owner that is located along Co. 7, Co. 101, and Landfill Road but is not located within the existing easement agreement area. The utility owners were invited to a meeting with MnDOT in August 2012 to discuss the need to relocate and to obtain information about existing utilities and potential relocation plans. A representative from each utility listed in Table 5.1.-1 attended the meeting. Table 5.1-1 summarizes the utilities located within the existing easement agreement area and their respective service areas. Table 5.1-1. Summary of Existing US 53 Corridor Utilities in the Existing Easement Agreement Area Utility Provider  Public or Private  Utility Services Within Corridor (Type)  Service Area Notes  City of Virginia  Public  Sanitary sewer (18” pipe; manholes) and storm sewer (ditches and pipes)  City of Virginia and Midway area; sanitary service line to Midway is a secondary line; storm sewer serves Landfill Road to 2nd Avenue interchange area with outlet to Rouchleau Pit, Minnewas Pit, and Manganika Creek  Virginia Department of Public Utilities (VPU)  Public  Water (10” pipe), electrical (overhead lines), and gas (3” low-pressure line)  Cities of Virginia (including 430 customers in the Midway area), Gilbert, and Eveleth  Minnesota Power  Private  Power/electrical (overhead lines)  Two main distribution lines serve communities to the south and east, including Eveleth, Gilbert, and Biwabik  CenturyLink  Private  Communication (nine 4” PVC conduits with concrete vaults at about 750-foot spacing)  Feeds Quad Cities area cell phone towers; toll, local, and long distance service from Virginia to Midway (Virginia), Eveleth, Gilbert, and Biwabik; serves St. Louis County  Mediacomm  Private  Communication (one fiber optic cable)  Telephone, internet, and cable TV service to approximately one-half of Virginia  Paul Bunyan Communications  Private  Communication (one fiber optic cable)  Ethernet service from Eveleth to Duluth and service to 12 cell phone towers  City of Virginia (Sanitary Sewer and Storm Sewer) The City of Virginia’s sanitary sewer facilities within the existing US 53 corridor consists of 18-inch PVC sanitary sewer (see Figure 5.1-1). The existing main was constructed in 2003/2004 and is located on the south side of the US 53 existing easement agreement area. The main is a gravity line consisting of pipe with concrete manholes located at approximately 200-foot to 400-foot intervals. Pipe grades vary between 0.25 and 9 percent. The main provides a second intermediate connection to a separate sanitary main that serves the Midway community. The wastewater treatment plant is located just west of the 2nd Avenue interchange loop, on the south side of US 53. The City of Virginia’s storm sewer facilities within and/or adjacent to the existing US 53 corridor consist of pipes and ditches that direct runoff from the east and west sides of the Rouchleau Pit to Manganika Creek. This system includes the Minnewas stormwater diversion pipe which diverts surface drainage coming from as far as the St. Louis County Landfill into a small inactive mine pit (the Minnewas Pit), located northwest of the junction of US 53 and MN 135. The diversion pipe was installed in 2000 to reduce flooding near 2nd Avenue and Southside Park (see Figure 5.1-1). Prior to the installation of the diversion system, surface runoff caused flooding in the vicinity of the 2nd Avenue interchange and 6th Avenue ball fields (Virginia’s Southside Park). In 1993-1994, two major rain events resulted in a breach of the east pit ditch, directing runoff directly into the Rouchleau Pit. There is currently a pipe in this breach location that allows some discharge directly into the Rouchleau Pit. This stormwater system, including the Minnewas Pit, includes a series of interconnected surface drainage ditches and pipes and manages flows from east to west, including drainage from Midway, the east pit area, the US 53 existing easement agreement area, and downtown Virginia. The system parallels much of the Landfill Road segment within the Alternative E-2 corridor with some diversion into the Minnewas Pit, and continues down-grade to the west along the north side of US 53 as it approaches 2nd Avenue in Virginia. This ditch is located partially within the existing easement agreement area. Near the east side of the US 53 interchange loop with 2nd Avenue, large-diameter reinforced concrete pipes direct this surface drainage across US 53 toward Manganika Creek. On the west side of the 2nd Avenue interchange loop, additional culverts cross US 53 at the old railroad grade directing downtown water to Manganika Creek. Virginia Department of Public Utilities (Water, Electric, and Gas) The VPU provides electrical, water, and gas service to the city of Virginia and surrounding communities (see Figures 5.1-1 and 5.1-2). In general, VPU’s facilities along the existing US 53 corridor (existing easement agreement area) serve approximately 430 customers in the Midway neighborhood. VPU provides and maintains the utility services. Within the existing US 53 corridor, VPU water utility consists of a 10-inch PE water main that runs from 2nd Avenue West along the north side of US 53 and continues along MN 135 to Bourgin Road. The main continues down Bourgin Road and provides a continuous connection to the Midway water tower. The main is also part of the interconnect system with Eveleth and Gilbert. The Eveleth and Gilbert connections are normally shut off but can provide emergency service to the communities if needed. There is also a booster station located within the US 53 corridor (in the existing easement agreement area near the 2nd Avenue interchange) consisting of two pumps within a block building shed enclosure. VPU’s electrical facilities within the existing US 53 corridor consist of overhead high voltage (13.8 kW/ 7.97 kW) running on the south side of the highway between Virginia and Midway. VPU’s system is co-located on Minnesota Power’s utility poles through a portion of the corridor. The overhead facility is fed from a substation near 6th Avenue, south of US 53, and serves the Midway neighborhood. VPU’s gas facilities within the existing US 53 corridor consist of three-inch low pressure gas line (less than 60 psi). The gas line runs along the south side of the highway to a regulator station in Midway. From this point the line continues on to residential feed points in Midway. A separate line doubles back along the US 53 corridor and to the north to Bourgin Road via the south side of MN 135 to a regulator station at Anderson Road, which provides a second feed to Midway for system redundancy in the event that either line is interrupted. Minnesota Power (Power/Electrical) Minnesota Power’s existing facility within the US 53 corridor consists of two main distribution lines consisting of three-phase overhead feeders. The lines are constructed to Minnesota Power’s bulk distribution standards consisting of 336 ACSR wire and class three utility poles with heavy cross arms. The lines are located on the north and east side of US 53 and cross the highway near the western extent of the Rouchleau Pit. Of the two main distribution lines, one serves the communities of Eveleth, Ely Lake, St. Mary’s Lake, and surrounding areas. The other line serves Laskin Energy Center, Gilbert, Biwabik, and McKinley, and, in the future, is intended to serve Hoyt Lakes and Aurora. Minnesota Power provides and maintains the utility service. CenturyLink (Communication) CenturyLink’s existing facility consists of a conduit system on the east side of existing US 53 that has nine four-inch PVC conduits with six-foot x 12-foot x seven-foot (width x length x depth) concrete vaults located at approximately 750-foot intervals. The conduit system contains three fiber optic cables and five copper cables. The lines are generally located at a depth of three feet. CenturyLink provides and maintains the utility service. The fiber cables serve AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint cell phone towers in the Quad Cities area; provide toll and long distance service from Virginia to Eveleth; and provide toll and long distance service from Virginia to Biwabik. The copper cables (900 and 1200 pair cable) provide local and long distance telephone and DSL service to Midway, Gilbert, and McKinley. The copper cables also serve the St. Louis County offices in downtown Virginia. Mediacomm (Communication) Mediacomm’s existing facility within the US 53 corridor consists of a single 24-count fiber optic cable in conduit. The line is located to the west of the highway between Eveleth and approximately the Mineview in the Sky entrance at which point the facility crosses US 53 and continues on the east side of the highway to Virginia. The facility provides telephone, internet, and cable TV service to approximately one-half of Virginia. The facility also supports Northeast Service Cooperative broadband network. Paul Bunyan Rural Telephone Cooperative (Communication) Paul Bunyan Rural Telephone Cooperative (Paul Bunyan Communications) has existing facilities within the US 53 corridor consisting of a 96-count fiber optic cable in conduit. The cable is located approximately 42 inches below grade and provides Ethernet1 service from Eveleth to Duluth as well as providing service to several cell towers. Paul Bunyan Communications provides and maintains the utility service. 5.1.3 Environmental Consequences The permits which allow for the utilities to be located within the MnDOT easement require each utility to be responsible for its operations and maintenance, and upon notice from MnDOT each utility must remove its infrastructure from the existing easement agreement area. MnDOT’s proposed action is driven by the RGGS existing easement agreement area terms, which require MnDOT to relocate US 53 from the existing easement agreement area. As a result, the direct impact to the utilities within this existing easement agreement area is the termination of the easement and subsequent termination of the utility permits. As such, MnDOT has initiated the termination notice process with each of the utilities. MnDOT notified each of the utilities described in this section (in letters dated May 4, 2012) of the US 53 project background and stated that all utilities must relocate from the existing easement agreement area by October 2016. Formal notice and orders are anticipated by early 2015. MnDOT’s US 53 project team met with representatives of the utilities on August 15, 2012. At this meeting, MnDOT explained its applicable policies and discussed the constraints of the project, including the following points: 1 A system for connecting a number of computer systems to form a local area connection ■ MnDOT’s policy is to accommodate utilities where it is feasible to do so. However, due to the complexities and constraints of the project, MnDOT is currently uncertain that the relocated highway will be able to accommodate any utility facilities, especially in the Alternative M-1 corridor due to lack of support by the mine operator. ■ If the new highway corridor is determined to be able to accommodate utilities, it is anticipated that the space available for installation of and access for maintenance and repairs to any facility may be severely limited due to constraints in roadway (embankment or bridge) sections and right-of-way width, steep inslopes, operation requirements of adjacent mining facilities, and other factors that may be determined as the highway design process continues. It is anticipated that a utility box/conduit would be required for most utilities in the steep sloped areas for maintenance access and for slope protection in the event of utility failure. If any additional right-of-way or infrastructure is required to accommodate utilities, utility companies would be responsible for the additional costs. Coordination with the utility companies is ongoing to see if utilities can be accommodated. Although MnDOT’s Utility Accommodation Policy cites that under certain conditions gas lines may be accommodated on bridges, it is not recommended for this project because of the high risk a gas line poses to bridge workers and the traveling public due to the susceptibility to flyrock hits from nearby blasting operations. The placement of a gas line on a high profile bridge, such as is proposed for Alternatives E-1A and E-2, poses homeland security concerns that would be difficult to mitigate with the level of gas line system monitoring that would be necessary. In order to evaluate the greatest potential impact of utilities being located within the corridors of the Build Alternatives, additional right-of-way width was assumed where possible (for Alternatives E-1A and E-2). There were essentially no differences in impacts to utilities among the options considered (Alternative E1A RSS Option, Bridge Option, Intersection Option, and Interchange Option; Alternative E-2 Straight Option, Curved Setback Option, Intersection Option, and Interchange Option). The utility owners and the St. Louis and Lake Counties Regional Railroad Authority (SLLCRRA) have received state bond funds for relocation of utilities and the Mesabi Trail. Table 5.1-2 provides a summary of the utilities’ proposed approach to relocation. Table 5.1-2. Summary of US 53 Corridor Utilities’ Proposed Approach to Relocation Utility Provider  Utility Preference Proposed Relocation Approach  City of Virginia  The City of Virginia will seek to relocate its sanitary facilities within the right-of-way of the preferred alternative with a system essentially identical to the existing system. Relocation into any Build Alternative would likely require construction of a sanitary force main system due to alignment requirements. Impacts to the stormwater system will need to be assessed and coordinated with RGGS, the City of Virginia, and adjacent mining interests.  Virginia Department of Public Utilities (VPU)  VPU will seek to relocate its facilities within the right-of-way of the preferred alternative with a system essentially identical to the existing system. A constrained cross section through the mine pits for any of the Build Alternatives would make the location of utilities in this corridor difficult. VPU requests consideration of a corridor on one side of the roadway for utilities and trail use.  Minnesota Power  Minnesota Power likely will seek to relocate its existing facilities such that one line would follow the preferred alternative alignment and the other line would follow a separate alternate route to provide redundancy for emergency service. Minnesota Power’s preference is for its power lines to remain overhead. In the event that an overhead facility is not feasible, a more costly underground facility can be provided.  CenturyLink  CenturyLink will seek to relocate its existing facility on a separate alternate route with a system similar to the existing: nine conduits with manholes every 750 feet to 1,000 feet.  Utility Provider  Utility Preference Proposed Relocation Approach  Mediacomm  Mediacomm will seek to relocate its existing facility within the right-of-way of the preferred alternative with a system essentially identical to existing, consisting of 1.5inch Schedule 40 conduit with a bury depth of 36 inches. An access vault at either end of the preferred alternative’s departure from and re-connection to the existing US 53 alignment will be required.  Paul Bunyan Communications  Paul Bunyan Communications will likely seek to relocate its existing facility on a separate alternate route with a system similar to the existing. An access vault (handhole) at either end of the reroute may be needed.  Northeast Services Cooperative  Northeast Services Cooperative may be impacted by the relocation/reconstruction of or near Landfill Road. It would seek to relocate its existing facility within the new Landfill Road right-of-way.  5.1.3.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) Under the No Build Alternative, MnDOT would terminate the existing utility permits, and the utilities within the US 53 existing easement agreement area would remove their infrastructure. This alternative does not create a corridor that utility owners could consider for rerouting their respective services. The reroute roadway corridors may be considered. The designated reroute of US 53 would add several (up to 22) miles to the length of the utility infrastructure. The cost for each utility would vary based on the infrastructure required. Each utility would be responsible for relocating its infrastructure from the existing easement agreement area. 5.1.3.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) Under the Existing US 53 Alternative, the potential need for utilities along US 53 to relocate their infrastructure would be eliminated 5.1.3.3 Alternative M-1 MnDOT would provide formal termination notice for the existing utility permits by early 2015, although utility owners have already been informed of the necessary relocations. The utilities within the US 53 existing easement agreement area would need to be relocated by October 2016 to allow MnDOT to vacate the easement agreement area by May 2017. Due to access restrictions for maintenance within the active mine and the constrained cross-section (without a trail) to minimize ferrous resource impact, this alternative cannot accommodate a new utility corridor that utility owners could consider for rerouting their respective services; other alignment options would need to be considered. The cost for each utility would vary based on the infrastructure required. Each utility would be responsible for relocating its infrastructure from the existing easement agreement area. 5.1.3.4 Alternative E-1A MnDOT would provide formal termination notice for the existing utility permits by early 2015, although utility owners have already been informed of the necessary relocations. The utilities within the US 53 existing easement agreement area would need to be relocated by October 2016 to allow MnDOT to vacate the easement agreement area by May 2017. This alternative may also require modification to the stormwater system along Landfill Road and near the existing US 53/2nd Avenue interchange. This alternative may permit a new corridor on the north side of the alignment that utility owners could consider for rerouting their respective services; however, other options should be considered. The cost for each utility would vary based on the infrastructure required. Each utility would be responsible for relocating its infrastructure from the existing easement agreement area. 5.1.3.5 Alternative E-2 MnDOT would provide formal termination notice for the existing utility permits by early 2015, although utility owners have already been informed of the necessary relocations. The utilities within the US 53 existing easement agreement area would need to be relocated by October 2016 to allow MnDOT to vacate the easement agreement area by May 2017. This alternative may also require modification to the stormwater system along Landfill Road and near the existing US 53/2nd Avenue interchange. This alternative may permit a new corridor that utility owners could consider for rerouting their respective services; however, other options should be considered. The cost for each utility would vary based on the infrastructure required. Each utility would be responsible for relocating its infrastructure from the existing easement agreement area. 5.1.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures The impact to utilities within the existing easement agreement area is not caused by the US 53 relocation project; rather, it is the result of the termination of easement rights by RGGS and UTAC. However, the planning and technical assistance provided through the US 53 EIS process can serve to minimize adverse impacts to utilities caused by the termination of the easement by providing opportunities for utilities to relocate within the preferred alternative as described in Section 5.1.4.1. While specific outcomes cannot be determined at this stage of analysis, the following measures will be considered in the planning process. 5.1.4.1 Avoidance and Minimization Minimization of Conflicts with Utilities Currently in Place As the preferred alternative is refined and designed in detail, highway designers will continue to coordinate with utilities to minimize conflicts. For example, a portion of US 53 within the existing easement agreement area (Cuyuna Drive to MN 135) is proposed to be retained for future highway use, and this might also perpetuate use by some utilities pending additional planning and easement negotiation with RGGS. Highway Design and Accommodation of Utilities Based on discussions with utility providers, a newly constructed US 53 corridor would represent a route to consider for co-location of utilities. The Build Alternatives (Alternatives M-1, E-1A, and E-2), with the assumed constrained cross sections through respective mine pits, may not have adequate space to provide for co-location of all utilities in a manner similar to the existing US 53 corridor. As noted in Table 5.1-2, VPU initially requested consideration of a 20-foot corridor on one side of the roadway for utilities with a 1:4 slope. The potential for added costs for a wider highway cross section (additional right-of-way) or other accommodations, compared to alternate utility routes, warrants further study and coordination with the utilities that would be responsible for the added costs. MnDOT is prepared to consider design modifications (such as utility box for slope protection and access) to accommodate co-location with utilities. However, costs associated with such modifications would need to be evaluated by each utility operator in determining their feasibility to co-locate since mitigation is not required by MnDOT. The corridors assumed for Alternatives E-1A and E-2 (averaging 200-400 feet wide and 150-300 feet wide, respectively) within the areas of evaluation included potential area for utilities on the northeast side of the roadway. If utilities are located elsewhere, the construction limits could be narrowed. Any utilities that may be relocated within the new US 53 right-of-way, would be established via a revocable permit issued by MnDOT, with construction funded by the utility owners. Funding Sources The utility owners and SLLCRRA have received state bond funds for relocation of utilities and the Mesabi Trail. 5.2 Water Supply NOTE TO READER: Water resource-related issues are discussed in a number of different sections of this Draft EIS. To facilitate cross-referencing coverage of water resources issues, the following summary of topics and Draft EIS sections may be useful. Section  Content  5.2. Water Supply  ■ Public water supply source-waters, users, and potential project impacts on source water quality and accessibility (i.e., potential for dewatering drawdown impacts on water supply intakes) ■ Includes discussion of the Rouchleau Pit as the source water for the city of Virginia and for the ArcelorMittal Mine  5.3. Waterbody Modification  ■ Discusses potential waterbody physical modifications (e.g., filling or hydraulic impacts associated with dewatering activities) ■ Includes descriptions of methods for construction dewatering for the two project alternatives that cross the Rouchleau Pit (Alternatives E-1A and E-2) ■ Alternative E-1A RSS Option includes one construction method that could include an approximate 30-foot drawdown of the Rouchleau Pit. Potential receiving waters for dewatering discharges for the drawdown method are also described in this section.  5.4. Wetlands  ■ Discusses impacts to surface waterbodies that meet the regulatory definition of wetlands  5.5. Surface Water Runoff: Quantity and Quality  ■ Describes potential surface water runoff (stormwater) impacts during and after construction and proposed mitigation (stormwater conveyance and treatment) ■ Includes discussion of spill containment  This section focuses on the potential for impacts to the Rouchleau Pit, which is the water supply source-water for the city of Virginia and for the ArcelorMittal Mine. Impacts considered in this section include water quality and accessibility (i.e., potential for dewatering drawdown impacts on water supply intakes). The evaluation of potential water supply impacts within the study area includes information derived from technical reports (Source Water Assessment for the city of Virginia (MDH, May 2003); TH 53 Relocation Alternative E-1A RSS Construction Option Water Management Study (HDR, 2014; provided in Appendix G) and a bathymetric survey (MnDOT, 2013)) (see Figure 5.2-1). These reports are incorporated herein by reference. 5.2.1 Regulatory Context and Methodology 5.2.1.1 Regulatory Context The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) (42 USC 300(f)) establishes National Primary Drinking Water Standards for the protection of aquifers. A list of drinking water contaminants can be found online.2 The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) is the state regulator for public water supply sources through its Drinking Water Protection Program. This program includes preparation of a Source Water Assessment for public water supplies. The MDH prepared a Source Water Assessment for Virginia, which was published in May 2003. 2 USEPA, http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/ Other applicable laws and regulations for water supply include: ■ The Clean Water Act of 1972, amended in 1987 (33 USC 1251) ■ MDH Water Well Construction Code (Minnesota Rules, Chapter 4725) 5.2.1.2 Methodology The analysis in this section focuses on the potential for impacts to the Rouchleau Pit, which is the water supply source-water for Virginia and the ArcelorMittal Mine. The City of Virginia (Virginia Department of Public Utilities [VPU]) draws its drinking water and cooling water for its power plant from the Rouchleau Pit, and the ArcelorMittal Mine uses water from the Rouchleau Pit as a source of backup water for its mining operations and diverts flow to supplement the Sauntry Creek system which flows through Bailey (also known as Virginia) and Silver Lakes in Virginia. The analysis looked at potential changes to water quality and access/availability of the Rouchleau Pit as the source of water for these users. ■ City of Virginia The MDH completed a Source Water Assessment for Virginia in May 2003. For the assessment, MDH defined an area which supplies water to the Virginia water utility. The source water assessment area for Virginia contains an inner emergency response area and an outer source water management area. As depicted in the MDH report (see Figure 5.2-2), the source water assessment area is generally east and northeast of Virginia, with US 53 and MN 135 marking the southern extent of the area. The Inner Emergency Response Area is located within the Source Water Assessment Area and was identified as an area where contaminant releases could present an immediate health concern to the citizens and businesses that receive water from this system. The Inner Emergency Response Area is defined by the amount of notification time the city needs to close the surface intake plus a buffer to accommodate unanticipated delays in notification and shut down. This area is equivalent to the surface watershed surrounding the Rouchleau Pit that drains directly into the pit. The Outer Source Water Management Area is defined by the groundwater divide around the Rouchleau Pit that was estimated by the MDH on the basis of available data including surface topography, the configuration of the Biwabik Iron Formation in the area, water levels in surrounding lakes and flooded mine pits, and water levels in surrounding wells. The existing US 53 easement agreement area under examination in this EIS, including US 53 and MN 135, is not within these source water areas. The VPU pumps its potable water from the northwest end of the Rouchleau Pit (just east of downtown Virginia), previously known as the Mesabi Mountain Mine Pit. This intake is approximately 1.4 miles from the existing US 53 roadway (via water surface). Due to the rising water levels within the pit since mining in this pit ceased, the Mesabi Mountain Mine Pit and Rouchleau Pit (south end) are now connected, creating one large waterbody that will continue to be referred to as the Rouchleau Pit in this discussion. Since the Rouchleau Pit is a surface water, it is considered highly susceptible to contamination. For purposes of the SDWA, susceptibility is defined as the likelihood that a contaminant would enter a public water supply at a level which may result in an adverse human health impact. However, the MDH Source Water Assessment notes that, “While it has been determined that Virginia’s source water is highly susceptible to contaminants found in the lake [pit], historically the city’s water plant has effectively treated this source water to meet or exceed safe drinking water standards.” It also states that: “There is relatively little surface runoff into the pit; the majority of water in the Mesabi Mountain [Rouchleau] Pit is contributed by the surrounding surficial drift aquifer and the Biwabik Iron Formation Aquifer. The large volume of water in the Mesabi Mountain [Rouchleau] Pit helps to attenuate contaminant concentration and also affects the movement of contaminants to the public water supply intake. The closer the source of contamination is to the intake, the greater the impact on the quality of the water used by Virginia. The further the source of contamination is from the intake, the more likely that the influence of such contamination on the public water supply would be attenuated through dilution.” Therefore, city water supply impacts, for purposes of this Draft EIS analysis, are defined as potential for roadway-related water quality effects within the Inner Emergency Response Area (which includes the Rouchleau Pit), with regard to: ■ Placement of roadway fill within the Rouchleau Pit ■ Potential for Rouchleau Pit water quality impacts from roadway spills ■ Potential for Rouchleau Pit water quality impacts from roadway surface runoff In addition, the potential effects of a drawdown of the Rouchleau Pit, one of the construction methods for the Alternative E-1A RSS Option, on the VPU’s and ArcelorMittal’s water supply intakes were also assessed. Figure 5.2-2. Virginia Source Water Assessment Area ■ ArcelorMittal Mine As noted previously, the ArcelorMittal Mine uses water from the Rouchleau Pit as a source of backup water for its mining operations, and it also diverts flow to supplement the Sauntry Creek system which flows through Bailey and Silver Lakes in Virginia. The mine transfers water from an intake at the far north end of the Rouchleau Pit to the southern end of the Enterprise Pit (just north of the Rouchleau Pit – see Figure 5.2-3). The mine pumps water for both process and potable water from a barge-mounted pumping system at the north end of the Enterprise Pit. It is conveyed through an overland pipe to the plant. At the plant it is split into process water and potable water. The potable portion is treated prior to use in the plant; the process water is not treated. Since the water use is just for the mine facility (i.e., not ‘public’), no Source Water Assessment has been done by the MDH for this water use. However, since the mine takes water from the north end of the Rouchleau Pit (northeast of the VPU’s intake; two miles from US 53 easement agreement area), it is reasonable to assume that the area mapped as Virginia’s Inner Emergency Response Area would be similar to the potential area of water quality concern for the ArcelorMittal Mine source water. The assessment of impacts to the Rouchleau Pit as a source water for the ArcelorMittal Mine included potential for water quality impacts based on assessment of the same area as Virginia’s Inner Emergency Response Area using the same method as for the city water supply, and the potential effects of a drawdown of the Rouchleau Pit, one of the construction methods for the Alternative E-1A RSS Option, on the water supply intake location/elevation. 5.2.2 Existing Conditions As noted previously, there is one water supply resource within the project study area: the Rouchleau Pit. The Rouchleau Pit is one of several mined pits that make up the common waterbody immediately east of Virginia (Figure 5.2-4), referred to in total as the Rouchleau Pit. Figure 5.2-4. Rouchleau Pit Historic Water Levels ■ City of Virginia Water Use Virginia has been using the Rouchleau Pit as a water source since 1931. The City of Virginia has a DNR water appropriation permit (#1984-2037) for the use of the Rouchleau Pit (Mesabi Pit portion) as the municipal water source. Although the type and location of the intake has varied over time, the present intake system was installed in 1990 and consists of two 24-inch wells drilled down approximately 300 feet to a horizontal drift shaft (Figure 5.2-5). Two 2,000 gallon per minute (GPM) submersible pumps supply the 2.1 million gallons per day (MGD) average daily demand of the Virginia system.3 The water intake system is located east and south of 2nd Street North, near Chestnut Street (Figure 5.2-4). Figure 5.2-5. Design Schematic for the City of Virginia Water Intake A A The spelling of Mesabi has varied over time. Variations of the Mesabi Pit name, including “Missabe,” appear in historical documents. Source: Minnesota Department of Health. “Virginia Gets an Upgrade.” Waterline. Winter 1999-2000. The Rouchleau Pit water is considered to be of very high quality. While it is designated as a surface water, very little surface runoff contributes to the overall water supply within the pit. The majority of water is contributed by groundwater from the surficial drift aquifer and the Biwabik Iron Formation Aquifer. The large volume of water in the pit and deep location of the VPU’s water intake helps to minimize potential problems related to any contaminants introduced to the supply. However, MDH has determined the susceptibility of the Rouchleau Pit to be high because there are no practical means of preventing all potential contaminant releases into the surface water. A $6.2 million water treatment facility upgrade and renovation was completed in 2001. The system presently consists of settling, filtration, and chemical treatment systems and is classified by the MDH as a Class A facility, the highest water treatment system classification in Minnesota. According to the MDH, currently turbidity, iron, and manganese are a treatment focus for the water treatment facility in Virginia. According to current City monitoring of the pit water, the turbidity levels within the raw water from the pit are less than two milligrams per liter (mg/l) which requires no treatment, as stated in the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (USEPA) Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule (71 FR 388, January, 4, 2006; Vol. 71, No. 2). The physical plant has the appropriate water treatment equipment to treat increases in turbidity and suspended solids if they occur. The 2003 MDH Source Water Assessment identifies potential sources of contamination to Virginia’s water supply source (Rouchleau Pit). As described in the Source Water Assessment, contaminants of 3 Virginia Public Utilities website (http://www.vpuc.com/departments.html, accessed September 19, 2014); Minnesota Department of Health. “Virginia Gets an Upgrade.” Waterline.

Available at http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/water/com/waterline/featurestories/virginia.html greatest concern to the city water supply are manganese, molybdenum and other metals, arsenic, bromine, fluoride, oils, fuels, solvents, sedimentation, microorganisms, turbidity and those contaminants commonly associated with turbidity, and contaminants that may be associated with past mining activities in the vicinity of the Rouchleau Pit (Mesabi Pit).4 VPU’s water supply system provides water to approximately 13,000 people and businesses in Virginia including Midway and portions of Mountain Iron. The VPU also uses this water supply for its power plant turbines and for maintaining ambient temperatures in Bailey and Silver Lakes, two waterbodies near downtown Virginia. In 2003-2004, the Cities of Virginia, Eveleth, Gilbert, and Mountain Iron completed an interconnected water supply piping system among these cities for an emergency backup supply from the VPU. Part of this piping connection is located within the existing US 53 easement agreement area. The interconnection piping system within the project area is discussed in Section 5.1. ■ ArcelorMittal Mine Water Use ArcelorMittal operates the Minorca Mine on the north side of Virginia. The mine operation also pumps water from the northeast end of the Rouchleau (Mesabi) Pit through a barge mounted pump system into the Enterprise Pit to provide potable and process water for their Minorca Mine operations. ArcelorMittal’s permit #2008-0216 has a maximum pumping rate of 2,000 GPM and a minimum target elevation of 1,280 feet mean sea level (msl) so as not to interfere with Virginia’s water supply (DNR correspondence, August 29, 2013). The pumping system can also divert water flow into the Sauntry Creek system to supplement flow to Bailey and Silver Lakes. The mine transfers water from an intake at the far north end of the Rouchleau Pit to the southern end of the Enterprise Pit (just north of the Rouchleau Pit; see Figure 5.2-3). All of the water for the ArcelorMittal Mine operation is taken after it mixes with the Enterprise Pit water. The mine pumps water for both process and potable water from a barge-mounted pumping system at the north end of the Enterprise Pit. It is conveyed through an overland pipe to the plant. At the plant it is split into process water and potable water. The potable portion is treated prior to use in the plant; the process water is not treated. ■ Rouchleau Pit Characteristics and Features Mine pits such as the Rouchleau Pit are dynamic hydrologic systems that are influenced by changes in mining activities. As mining in the Rouchleau Pit area declined in the 1980s, water levels in the pit began to rise with the elimination of mine dewatering systems. Water elevations in the pit fluctuated between 1,115 feet and 1,135 feet msl during the 1980s. Starting in the early 1990s, water elevation in the pit continued to rise. By 1997, water elevation in the pit was approximately 1,225 feet msl, and by 2009 the elevation peaked at 1,310 feet msl. Water levels in the pit have declined slowly since 2009, by approximately two to three feet per year. The October 2012 water elevation was estimated to be 1,302 feet msl (Draft Source Water Protection: Virginia Public Water Supply System, NTS, Inc., May 2013). The aerial photos shown in Figure 5.2-4 demonstrate the variation in water level, notably how the separation between the Mesabi and Rouchleau Pits becomes apparent at lower surface water elevations. While the exact reason for water elevation decline in recent years is uncertain, one explanation may be the current sources of discharge (city of Virginia and ArcelorMittal mine operations) exceed the rate of recharge from groundwater. The Draft Source Water Protection report found that if the pumping rate from the Rouchleau Pit exceeds 1,235 million gallons/year (2,350 GPM) in a typical precipitation/evaporation year, then the water level would decline. In July 2013, MnDOT conducted a bathymetric survey of the Rouchleau Pit. This survey indicated a 500 foot wide submerged haul road embankment crossing the southern part of the pit (Alternative E-1A alignment), within five to 25 feet of the existing water surface. A number of areas adjacent to this submerged embankment drop off sharply to depths of over 300 feet (as shown in Figure 5.2-1). There are 4 The spelling of Mesabi has varied over time. Variations of the Mesabi Pit name, including “Missabe,” appear in historical documents. This document will use Mesabi throughout. also three natural land bridges in the Rouchleau Pit, as shown in Figure 5.2-6, with elevations around 1,180 feet msl. If the water level decreased below approximately 1,180 feet msl, it would result in the creation of sub-pits. 5.2.3 Environmental Consequences 5.2.3.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) The No Build Alternative is located outside of the Inner Emergency Response Area identified by MDH. Therefore, there are no anticipated direct impacts to water quality or accessibility of the water supply for either Virginia or the ArcelorMittal Mine with this alternative. 5.2.3.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) Under the Existing US 53 Alternative, existing roadways are left intact to retain the current operation of US 53. Therefore, no changes to water supply resources would result. 5.2.3.3 Alternative M-1 Alternative M-1 is located south of existing US Highway 53. This realignment would move the highway away from the Rouchleau Pit and the Inner Emergency Response Area. Based on the location of Alternative M-1, this alternative would not require the placement of fill within the Rouchleau Pit or have any run-off or the potential for spills to reach the Rouchleau Pit. No direct impacts to water quality or accessibility of the water supply are expected. 5.2.3.4 Alternative E-1A Alternative E-1A would cross the Rouchleau Pit along an existing submerged haul road embankment via fill (RSS Option) or a bridge (Bridge Option). RSS Option A number of construction methods have been considered for constructing engineered fill across the Rouchleau Pit for the Alternative E-1A RSS Option, including drawing down the pit water level to work in the dry, construct in the wet condition, or create a cofferdam for localized dewatering (see descriptions of these three methods in Section 5.3.3.2). Construction in dry conditions (i.e., pit drawdown method) could require the Rouchleau Pit to be dewatered to an elevation of 1,275 feet, or 30 feet below the surface elevation of 1,305 (measured summer 2013). The potential effects of the dewatering on the Rouchleau Pit water level and discharge to potential receiving waterbodies for the dry fill scenario are discussed in Section 5.3. The effects related to the Rouchleau Pit as a source water are described below. ■ Water Supply Quality The proposed Alternative E-1A alignment is located within the Virginia Inner Emergency Response Area (Figure 5.2-2). The City’s intake system is located approximately 0.8 miles north of the proposed Alternative E-1A alignment (see Figure 5.2-4) and the ArcelorMittal Mine intake is located approximately 1.5 miles north of the alignment. The potential quality impacts to the water supply source for a fill crossing (the RSS Option) are described below. Turbidity is a potential concern for fill placement within the pit. This may be minimized by placing fill in the dry condition (pit water drawdown of up to 30 feet to expose submerged haul road embankment) and stabilizing the new road embankment with engineered reinforcement. If turbidity is temporarily increased beyond USEPA thresholds during construction of the embankment, as monitored by the City, the City would treat the turbidity in order to comply with the USEPA’s Disinfectant and Disinfection Byproducts rule. However, localized turbidity from road construction could be effectively controlled with erosion control best management practices (BMPs). The City has indicated to MnDOT (multiple conversations, 2013; see correspondence in Appendix G) that potential turbidity generated from project construction is not expected to be an issue at its intake, which is nearly a mile from the new alignment and nearly 200 feet deep. Similarly, turbidity has not been identified as a concern at the ArcelorMittal Mine intake given its distance from the alignment (see correspondence in Appendix G). A clean source of fill would be used below normal water level to avoid potential contamination issues. Specifically, fill material from eastern Biwabik Iron Formation areas, which are known to be high in sulfide bearing rock, will not be used. Local soil/rock material excavated from the construction zone may be used for fill if shown to be low in sulfides. MnDOT will also follow its technical guidance for best management practices for handling taconite tailings in road aggregate (see Appendix I). Any potential contaminant spills on the road RSS fill section, such as gasoline, oil, and antifreeze, would be collected within the storm sewer system on the road and conveyed to treatment ponds where they could be contained for cleanup; therefore, potential contaminants would not be directly discharged into the pit or other surface waters. Emergency spills would be cleaned up as identified in MnDOT’s Emergency Spill Response Technical Memorandum (MnDOT, April 2011). Stormwater runoff from the RSS fill section would be collected and conveyed to the west side of the Rouchleau Pit (see Section 5.3). No untreated stormwater runoff would directly enter the pit. Therefore, contaminants from road surface runoff (including de-icing and anti-icing compounds) would not be directed to the Rouchleau Pit. If incidental amounts of runoff entered the Rouchleau Pit in the area of Alternative E-1A, the distance (approximately 0.8 mile) and volume of water between the road and the intake and the difference in depth between the road (5 to 30 feet below water surface) and the intake (approximately 190 feet below water surface) would cause dilution of contaminants, resulting in no need to modify current water supply treatment. Similarly, stormwater has not been identified as a concern at the ArcelorMittal Mine intake given its distance from the alignment. A number of additional stormwater features would be incorporated into the road design where feasible to provide additional opportunities for spill containment and stormwater treatment. Features such as ditch checks, small interconnected ponds, and sediment basins will be used in conjunction with treatment ponds. Based on implementation of mitigation measures described in Section 5.2.4, no quality impacts to the Rouchleau Pit water supply source are anticipated for any of the construction methods being considered for the RSS Option. ■ Accessibility If the pit drawdown construction method was used for fill placement, lowering the water level in the Rouchleau Pit would have minimal effects on the water intake pumps that supply the VPU’s water treatment plant. The submerged intake for the water pumps is at an elevation of 1,117 feet. With a 30 foot drawdown of the pit (for dry fill construction), the water surface elevation in the pit is projected to be 1,275 feet during the earliest part of construction of the embankment. This drawdown level is well above the minimum water elevation (1,123 feet) established for the pumphouse. However, it may change the head conditions under which the pumps operate, resulting in a minor reduction in pump capacity (drop from 2,000 GPM to 1,800 GPM). The reduced capacity of the pumps may require slightly longer pump run times and slightly decreased efficiency but should not affect the utility’s ability to effectively treat and deliver water (HDR, 2014). With regard to ArcelorMittal mining operations, the construction method requiring an approximately 30 foot drawdown of the Rouchleau Pit could result in impacts to the ArcelorMittal Mine intake pumps/barge at the north end of the Rouchleau (Mesabi) Pit (Figure 5.2-3). These pumps move Rouchleau Pit water to the adjacent Enterprise Pit for backup mine use. A water level drop of 30 feet could render this system inoperable without substantial elevation adjustments (HDR, 2014). The ArcelorMittal groundwater appropriations permit allows it to drawdown the Enterprise Pit to an elevation of 1,280 feet. If the adjacent Rouchleau Pit dewatering results in the Enterprise Pit level being temporarily below 1,280 feet, a permit modification may also be required for the mine. However, as described in Section 5.3, because MnDOT needs to find acceptable receiving water locations for its dewatering, the dewatering system could provide the necessary volume of backup water that ArcelorMittal requires to maintain the water level in the Enterprise Pit and continue its mining operations, as well as to maintain the option to divert water into the Sauntry Creek system. MnDOT would detail the pumping rates to this receiving water in MnDOT’s dewatering permit and coordinate an agreement with the mine operator. Additional information on dewatering options and their relationship to the ArcelorMittal intake can be found in the TH 53 Relocation Alternative E-1A RSS Construction Option Water Management Study (HDR, 2014; provided in Appendix G) and Section 5.3. Bridge Option ■ Water Supply Quality The Alternative E-1A Bridge Option is located within the Virginia Inner Emergency Response Area (Figure 5.2-2). The City’s intake system is located approximately 0.8 miles north of the proposed Alternative E-1A alignment (see Figure 5.2-4) and the ArcelorMittal Mine intake is located approximately 1.5 miles north of the alignment. The potential water supply source impacts for a bridge crossing are described below. Turbidity is a potential concern for bridge construction but to a lesser degree (compared to use of embankment fill involved in the RSS Option) given fill/disturbance (excavation, pilings, etc.) would be limited to pier construction areas. If turbidity is increased beyond USEPA thresholds as a result of constructing the bridge, as monitored by the City, the City would treat the turbidity in order to comply with the USEPA’s Disinfectant and Disinfection Byproducts rule. However, localized turbidity from pier construction could be effectively controlled with erosion control BMPs. Similarly, turbidity has not been identified as a concern at the ArcelorMittal Mine intake given its distance from the alignment (see correspondence in Appendix G). Stormwater runoff from the bridge would be collected and conveyed to the west side of the pit. No untreated stormwater runoff would directly enter the pit. Therefore, contaminants from road/bridge surface runoff would not be directed to the Rouchleau Pit. If incidental amounts of runoff do enter the Rouchleau Pit in the area of Alternative E-1A, the distance (approximately 0.8 miles) and volume of water between the bridge and the intake and the depth of the intake (approximately 190 feet below water surface), dilution of contaminants would occur, resulting in no need to modify current water supply treatment. Similarly, stormwater runoff has not been identified as a concern at the ArcelorMittal Mine intake given its distance from the alignment. Any potential contaminant spills on the bridge, such as gasoline, oil, and antifreeze, would be collected within the storm sewer system on the bridge and conveyed to a treatment pond where they could be contained for cleanup; therefore, no contaminants would discharge into the pit. Emergency spills would be cleaned up as identified in MnDOT’s Emergency Spill Response Technical Memorandum (MnDOT, April 2011). A clean source of fill would be used below normal water level to avoid potential contamination issues. Specifically, fill material from eastern Biwabik Iron Formation areas, which are known to be high in sulfide bearing rock, will not be used. Local soil/rock material excavated from the construction zone may be used for fill if shown to be low in sulfides. MnDOT will also follow its technical guidance for best management practices for handling taconite tailings in road aggregate (see Appendix I). ■ Accessibility This alternative would have no impacts to VPU’s or ArcelorMittal’s intake pumps. Based on consideration of anticipated impacts and implementation of mitigation measures described in Section 5.2.4, no quality or accessibility impacts to the Rouchleau Pit water supply are anticipated for the Alternative E-1A Bridge Option. Intersection and Interchange Options These options are located outside the Rouchleau Pit and have no impacts to water supply. 5.2.3.5 Alternative E-2 Alternative E-2 would cross the Rouchleau Pit. The crossing method was determined to be a bridge based on the potential complications involved in constructing a fill section in this location (see discussion in Section 2.4.4). There would be no differences in impacts to the water supply resulting from the Interchange and Intersection Options or the Straight and Curved Setback Options given their location outside the pit. ■ Water Supply Quality The proposed Alternative E-2 alignment has potential to impact to the Virginia Inner Emergency Response Area (Figure 5.2-2). The City’s intake system is located approximately 0.6 miles north of the proposed Alternative E-2 alignment (see Figure 5.2-4) and approximately 1.2 miles from ArcelorMittal’s intake. The potential water supply source impacts for a bridge crossing for Alternative E-2 are described below. Turbidity is a potential concern for bridge construction but at a lesser degree (compared to use of embankment fill) given fill/disturbance (excavation, pilings, etc.) would be limited to pier construction areas. If turbidity is increased beyond USEPA thresholds as a result of constructing the bridge, as monitored by the City, the City would treat the turbidity in order to comply with the USEPA’s Disinfectant and Disinfection Byproducts rule. However, localized turbidity from pier construction could be effectively controlled with erosion control BMPs. Similarly, turbidity has not been identified as a concern at the ArcelorMittal Mine intake given its distance from the alignment (see correspondence in Appendix G). Stormwater runoff from the bridge would be collected and conveyed to stormwater ponds. No untreated stormwater runoff would directly enter the pit. Therefore, contaminants from road/bridge surface runoff would not be directed to the Rouchleau Pit. If incidental amounts of runoff do enter the Rouchleau Pit in the area of Alternative E-2, the distance (approximately 0.6 miles) and volume of water between the bridge and the intake and the depth of the intake (approximately 190 feet below water surface), dilution of contaminants would occur, resulting in no need to modify current water supply treatment. Similarly, stormwater runoff has not been identified as a concern at the ArcelorMittal Mine intake given its distance from the alignment. Any potential contaminant spills on the bridge, such as gasoline, oil, and antifreeze, would be collected within the storm sewer system on the bridge and conveyed to a treatment pond where they could be contained for cleanup; therefore, no contaminants would discharge into the pit. Emergency spills would be cleaned up as identified in MnDOT’s Emergency Spill Response Technical Memorandum (MnDOT, April 2011). A clean source of fill would be used below normal water level to avoid potential contamination issues. Specifically, fill material from eastern Biwabik Iron Formation areas, which are known to be high in sulfide bearing rock, will not be used. Local soil/rock material excavated from the construction zone may be used for fill if shown to be low in sulfides. MnDOT will also follow its technical guidance for best management practices for handling taconite tailings in road aggregate (see Appendix I). ■ Accessibility This alternative would have no impacts to VPU’s or ArcelorMittal’s intake pumps. Based on consideration of anticipated impacts and implementation of mitigation measures described in Section 5.2.4, no quality or accessibility impacts to the Rouchleau Pit water supply are anticipated for this alternative. Intersection, Interchange, Straight, and Curved Setback Options These options are located outside the Rouchleau Pit and have no impacts to water supply. 5.2.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures Alternatives E-1A and E-2 were identified as having potential for impacts to the Virginia water supply source water and potentially to the ArcelorMittal Mine appropriation supply due to the location of the alternatives in relation to the Rouchleau Pit. 5.2.4.1 Avoidance and Minimization Alternatives E-1A (RSS Option and Bridge Option) and E-2: To avoid the potential for contamination impacts to the water supply, specifications for the source and nature of any fill (i.e., use of clean fill; use of mining by-products only if low in sulfides) used within the Inner Emergency Response Area would be required for project construction. During construction, USEPA National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) BMPs and other measures would be in place to avoid/minimize any potential stormwater runoff or erosion issues that would impact Virginia’s water supply. Alternative E-1A RSS Option: Measures that have been identified to minimize potential for water quality impacts include slope stabilization, stormwater collection, and a spill containment system. To address potential drawdown impacts to the adjacent Enterprise Pit, water generated by dewatering (i.e., water pumped from the Rouchleau Pit during dewatering) would be provided to ArcelorMittal to maintain Enterprise Pit water level and eliminate the need for barge modifications. Coordination of appropriations permit modification would occur to allow for temporary water levels below 1,280 in the Enterprise Pit. These measures would be negotiated with the mine operator (ArcelorMittal) and the DNR if the drawdown method were selected. Additional information on dewatering methods can be found in the TH 53 Relocation Alternative E-1A RSS Construction Option Water Management Study (HDR, 2014; provided in Appendix G) and Section 5.3. Alternatives E-1A Bridge Option and E-2: The proposed bridge crossing over the Rouchleau Pit would minimize potential water quality impacts by requiring negligible fill within the water. The option of constructing the crossing on a fill section was eliminated for Alternative E-2 due to cost and constructability concerns and the potential for water quality impacts with fill depth (up to 120 feet) and proximity to the City’s intake wells (see Chapter 2: Alternatives). 5.2.4.2 Mitigation Measures BMPs, as identified within the NPDES SWPPP, would be implemented by MnDOT to minimize the amount of turbidity generated by the project within the Rouchleau (Mesabi) Pit water supply. The City would continue to monitor for turbidity levels and, if thresholds are exceeded, would implement additional treatment to comply with the USEPA’s Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproduct Rule (71 FR 388) (email from Mike Appelwick, dated 10/1/2012) (see Appendix G). 5.3 Waterbody Modification NOTE TO READER: Water resource-related issues are discussed in a number of different sections in this chapter of the Draft EIS. To facilitate cross-referencing coverage of water resources issues, the summary of topics and Draft EIS sections in the call out box may be useful. The following evaluation of potential waterbody physical modifications within the study area is derived from several technical reports (including the Preliminary Geotechnical Engineering Report for TH 53 Relocation: E-1A Alignment – Embankment (Gale-Tec Engineering Inc., 2014), Preliminary Geotechnical Engineering Report for TH 53 Relocation: M-1 Foundations (Gale-Tec Engineering Inc., 2013), and TH 53 Relocation Alternative E-1A RSS Construction Option Water Management Study (HDR, 2014; provided in Appendix G))and a bathymetric survey (MnDOT, 2013) (depicted in Figure 5.2-1). These reports are incorporated herein by reference and available on the project website.5 5.3.1 Regulatory Context and Methodology 5.3.1.1 Regulatory Context The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) regulates waters of the US under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act established a program to regulate the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including those wetlands that are not isolated hydrologically on the landscape. The West Two Rivers Reservoir is a water of the US, which is being considered as a temporary receiving water for dewatering discharges under a construction method being considered for the Alternative E-1A RSS Option, as described in Section 5.3.2. The DNR regulates physical modification of state designated public waters; however, no state public waters have been identified within the project study area. One state public waterbody, West Two Rivers Reservoir, is being considered as a temporary receiving waterbody for dewatering discharge. Water use, including transfers of water and dewatering for construction, are managed by the DNR through the water appropriation permit program. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) regulates the operation of wastewater disposal systems and the discharge of wastewater to receiving waters of the state through its NPDES/State Disposal System (SDS) water quality permitting program. It does not regulate transfers of water, as defined by federal law, from one waterbody to another that does not involve an intervening commercial or industrial use or the introduction of pollutants. The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact (Great Lakes Compact) prohibits diversion of water from the Great Lakes Basin. The compact was adopted in 2005 and signed into law in 2008. Within five years of the compact adoption, a list of existing withdrawals, diversions, and consumptive uses were submitted by each state to establish a baseline for determining new or increased withdrawals, diversions, and consumptive uses. On the list submitted by the State of Minnesota was U.S. Steel Minntac Water Appropriation permit 1963-0846, which authorizes a volume of 24.1 million gallons per day (8.797 billion gallons per year) as part of the baseline diversions. 5.3.1.2 Methodology For purposes of this evaluation, a waterbody is defined as an open surface water which does not qualify as a wetland (wetlands are covered in Section 5.4). Waterbodies within the study area were evaluated for potential physical impacts resulting from construction. Impacts were quantified based on the area of evaluation for each alternative as described at the beginning of this chapter (shown in Figures 2.1-5, 2.1-6, and 2.2-1). In addition, this section assesses the physical (hydraulic) and water quality impacts to potential receiving waters if temporary dewatering is required for construction of an alternative. For those alternatives, the volume of water appropriation required and the capacity of potential waterbodies to receive the discharge were evaluated. The potential for water quality and accessibility impacts to the Rouchleau Pit water supply users is discussed in Section 5.2. Stormwater runoff impacts are discussed in Section 5.5. 5.3.2 Existing Conditions The only waterbody identified in the area potentially affected by project construction is the Rouchleau Pit, which encompasses the Mesabi Mountain Mine Pit and several other pits and has developed into a contiguous waterbody. The Rouchleau Pit is groundwater fed and receives minor surface water runoff. The Rouchleau Pit does not have any public access, was not identified on the DNR’s public waters inventory, and is not considered a DNR public water; however, for MPCA water quality permitting 5 http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/TechnicalReports.html considerations, it is a water of the state as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 115.01. It is not a water of the US for purposes of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The water depth of the Rouchleau Pit is estimated to be at least 120 feet in the Alternative E-2 crossing location and over 300 feet adjacent to the Alternative E-1A crossing area. The submerged haul road embankment at Alternative E-1A has water depths of approximately five to 30 feet according to the bathymetric survey (MnDOT, 2013) (see Figure 5.2-1). See Section 5.2 for more information on the water level within the Rouchleau Pit. The pit itself is estimated to be an average of 300 feet deep with banks above the water line that exceed 130 feet on the west side and nearly 170 feet on the east side. There are three waterbodies that are being considered as potential receiving waters for temporary construction dewatering under Alternative E-1A. Similar to the Rouchleau Pit, two of the waters (Enterprise Pit and Minntac Cell 2) do not have any public access, are not considered DNR public waters, and are not a water of the US for purposes of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. However, for MPCA water quality permitting considerations, they are waters of the state as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 115.01. The three waterbodies include: ■ The Enterprise Pit: This pit is located just north of the Rouchleau Pit. It has no natural outlet and was once a mine pit that has filled in with groundwater. Water is pumped into the Enterprise Pit from the Rouchleau Pit via a barge-mounted pump station by ArcelorMittal. Water can also be diverted from the pipeline between the Rouchleau Pit and the Enterprise Pit to augment water levels in Sauntry Creek and Bailey/Silver Lakes. Water is pumped from the Enterprise Pit by ArcelorMittal for use at the Minorca taconite processing plant. ■ West Two Rivers Reservoir: This basin is located approximately 5.5 miles west of the Rouchleau Pit. This reservoir outlets to West Two Rivers and is used by Minntac as an alternate source for process makeup water. There are two controlled outlets from the reservoir. One is a stoplog structure/sheetpile dam, which flows into West Two Rivers. The second is a siphon outlet through the primary earthen dam that provides a minimum flow of three cubic feet per second (cfs) into West Two Rivers to maintain/augment minimum flow. The siphon outlet was part of the 1963 water appropriation permit that authorized establishment of the reservoir.6 West Two Rivers eventually flows to the St. Louis River. There are currently natural flows into the reservoir, including some of the dewatering flow from US Steel’s Minntac East and West mine pits. This reservoir is a DNR public water (994P) and a water of the US. ■ The US Steel Minntac Tailings Basin Cell 2: This basin is located approximately six miles northwest of the Rouchleau Pit. There is no surface outlet (i.e., discharge pipe or overflow) from the tailings basin although uncaptured seepage from the basin flows to the Dark River and Sand River systems. Water from the ore processing is discharged into the tailings basin. Minntac has one seepage capture system (and is developing a second), which routes seepage back into the tailings basin. Clear water (after settling) is re-circulated to the plant to be used as process water. It is essentially a semi-closed loop with evaporation and uncaptured seepage losses. 5.3.3 Environmental Consequences 5.3.3.1 No Build, Existing US 53, and M-1 Alternatives These alternatives result in no new construction (No Build and Existing US 53 Alternatives) or are not located in proximity to the Rouchleau Pit (Alternative M-1) and therefore do not have any effect on the Rouchleau Pit waterbody. 6 US Steel’s Water Appropriation Permit issued in 1963 (Permit # 1963-0846) authorized (1) the establishment of the West Two Rivers Reservoir and (2) the appropriation of water from the reservoir to the Mountain Iron Pit and required a minimum three cfs be released from the reservoir at all times for stream augmentation. 5.3.3.2 Alternative E-1A RSS Option Crossing the Rouchleau Pit via an engineered fill section would separate the westernmost portion of the pit from the larger waterbody to the east, but the two sides would remain hydraulically connected due to porosity of the fill. Therefore, water levels on both sides of the new road are expected to rebound slowly and equalize after dewatering for construction has ceased. There are three different construction methods that have been evaluated to construct the Alternative E-1A RSS Option (Gale-Tec Engineering, 2014), all of which would have approximately the same fill footprint (approximately 29 acres). Each method can and would be designed for stability with variable water level conditions during and after construction and would not limit future dewatering or mining operations within the existing permit to mine or environmental setting boundaries. ■ Construct in the wet condition: With this method fill would be placed starting at one or both ends of the water crossing, pushing fill into the water until the road base is above the water line (30 feet). It would result in the greatest exposure of the waterbody to potential turbidity. It is also the least desirable from a stability perspective due to the added difficulty of achieving good compaction in an inundated environment and removing submerged trees and other organics from the submerged haul road. ■ Create a cofferdam for localized dewatering: With this method a barrier would be placed around the construction area, and water from within the construction zone would be pumped out to create dry conditions. The removed water would be routed through a sediment basin and back into the Rouchleau Pit outside of the construction zone. The turbidity exposure potential is reduced to the period during construction of the cofferdam. The volume of water from dewatering would be approximately 135 million gallons for initial drawdown and 10,000 to 50,000 gallons per minute, depending on the permeability of the buried mine waste rock fill in the submerged haul road and the method chosen for sealing the bottom of the construction area to maintain conditions such that embankment construction could occur and compaction would be conducted in dry conditions. This dewatering would not result in any temporary or permanent modification to the current water level in the Rouchleau Pit. ■ Drawing down the entire pit water level to work in the dry: If this construction method is used, a water level drop of 30 feet in the Rouchleau Pit (from an elevation of 1,305 feet (measured in 2013) to the top of the submerged haul road embankment at 1,275 feet) would be required, representing a total volume of approximately 2.65 billion gallons. To remove this volume of water in a three month window, dewatering would need to occur at a rate of 23,850 GPM or 34.3 MGD (adjusted to accommodate the additional groundwater inflow induced by the dewatering). Once an elevation of 1,275 feet is reached, maintenance pumping would occur at a rate of approximately 5,400 GPM during the remaining dewatering period to allow embankment construction/compaction to occur in dry conditions. This maintenance dewatering period is expected to be less than six months since dewatering could cease after the road fill reaches above 30 feet. If one of the first two methods were used for construction of this alternative, the waterbody impact would essentially be limited to the footprint of the road fill (29 acres). There would be no temporary or permanent impacts to water levels in the pit. If the pit drawdown approach were used for dry fill placement, pumped water would need to be conveyed to surface waters outside the immediate project area. Potential receiving waters were identified using aerial mapping data and with input from MnDOT, DNR, MPCA, the City of Virginia, VPU, ArcelorMittal, Cliffs Natural Resources, and US Steel. The TH 53 Relocation Alternative E-1A RSS Construction Option Water Management Study (HDR, 2014; provided in Appendix G) describes over a dozen potential receiving waters considered for the pit drawdown construction method to determine which were feasible. In the Water Management Study, the receiving water options were analyzed for their capacity to receive the water volume and the potential water appropriations and water quality permit requirements. Many of the options for a water transfer were eliminated due to the high flow rate associated with the relatively short three month period allocated for the initial drawdown dewatering, which is dictated by the construction schedule. In addition, options where the proposed water transfer would impact an existing NPDES permit, requiring either a major modification or permit re-issuance, were eliminated from further study due to schedule constraints. Another factor considered in the analysis was whether the receiving water options were waters of the state, as defined by federal law. If so, the transfer would then be between waters of the state and would not be subject to MPCA water quality permitting, provided that there is no intervening commercial or industrial use of the water and no pollutants are introduced during construction operations or transfer of the water. Any construction activities within the Rouchleau Pit would require coverage under the MPCA’s construction stormwater permitting program. Conditions of the construction stormwater permit would preclude the introduction of construction-related pollutants to the water being transferred. Based on the feasibility assessment in the Water Management Study (HDR, 2014; provided in Appendix G), two waterbodies (the West Two Rivers Reservoir and the US Steel Minntac Tailings Basin Cell 2) were identified as feasible options for receiving high-volume flows from the initial drawdown dewatering period, and one waterbody (the Enterprise Pit) was identified as a feasible option for the construction maintenance dewatering period. All three of the waterbodies were determined to have the capacity to receive the maintenance and/or initial drawdown dewatering discharges without adverse hydraulic impacts. The dewatering conveyance piping from the Rouchleau Pit to the receiving waters would be located to minimize environmental impacts, and the discharge outlet at the receiving water would be designed to minimize erosion/scour at the discharge point. For all three of the options, potential routes were identified that would have the least potential for environmental impacts (see Figure 5.3-1). The temporary, above-ground (except at road or railroad crossings) dewatering conveyance piping would be routed primarily within previously disturbed areas (road, railroad, utility corridors, and previously mined/graded areas). Three parallel 36-inch steel pipes would be placed on existing ground surface and remain in place for a minimum of six months. The waterbody characteristics and potential implications of receiving dewatering flows are described below, along with proposed temporary piping routing locations. ■ The Enterprise Pit is located immediately north of Rouchleau Pit and is an intake source for the ArcelorMittal Mine water supply. This system does not have capacity to accommodate the initial drawdown volume but could accommodate the maintenance dewatering volume. A water transfer from the Rouchleau Pit to the Enterprise Pit as part of the dewatering scheme would mitigate the loss of operation of the existing ArcelorMittal pumping station in the Rouchleau Pit if water levels decreased below the intake elevation (see section 5.2.3.4). However, MnDOT may need to adjust or relocate the barge pumping system during the drawdown. Routing water to the Enterprise Pit would involve minimal infrastructure given its proximity to the Rouchleau Pit. In addition, some water could be diverted to Sauntry Creek, possibly using the existing diversion structure to supplement flow to Bailey and Silver Lakes. The Enterprise Pit has no natural outlet; it was once a mine pit that has filled in with groundwater. Water is currently pumped from the Enterprise Pit by ArcelorMittal for use at the Minorca mine. ■ Piping Route: Water could be pumped over the ridge between the Rouchleau and Enterprise Pits using ArcelorMittal’s existing pipe and/or adding parallel pipes to accommodate the additional water volume (see Figure 5.3-1). No permanent resource impacts would occur from the installation of these temporary pipes. There would be temporary impacts to existing vegetation, which would be restored after the pipes are removed. For additional details, see Section 5.16.1.10. ■ The West Two Rivers Reservoir is located approximately 5.5 miles west of Rouchleau Pit. This reservoir outlets to West Two Rivers and is used by US Steel as a source for process makeup water for its Minntac facility. Routing this water would require placement of aboveground piping (three 30inch high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes) placed primarily within existing road/railroad right-or-way and other previously disturbed areas. The pipe would cross US 53 and other roads via existing culvert locations or would be bored under the roadways and railroad crossings when necessary. Where crossing wetlands or other undisturbed ground, the pipe would be placed on the surface and removed when dewatering is complete. As noted in Section 5.3.2, there are two controlled outlets from the reservoir. ■ Piping Route: The pipe to transfer Rouchleau Pit water to the West Two Rivers Reservoir would be pumped from the southwest end of the Rouchleau Pit, crossing under existing US 53 via existing bridges near 2nd Avenue to follow along the south US 53 right-of-way to US 169. Using the south right-of-way of US 169, the pipes would extend to the west to an existing power line corridor just north of the reservoir, then use the power line corridor to reach the reservoir (see Figure 5.3-1). No permanent resource impacts would occur from the installation of these temporary pipes. There would be temporary impacts to existing vegetation, which would be restored after the pipes are removed. For additional details, see Section 5.16.1.10. ■ The US Steel Minntac Tailings Basin Cell 2 is located approximately six miles northwest of the Rouchleau Pit and can accommodate the initial drawdown volume. Routing this water would require placement of above ground piping (three 30-inch HDPE pipes) placed primarily within existing road/railroad right-or-way and other previously disturbed areas. The pipe would cross US 53 and other roads via existing culvert locations or would be bored under the roadways and railroad crossings when necessary. Where crossing wetlands or other undisturbed ground, the pipe would be placed on the surface and removed when dewatering is complete. As noted in Section 5.3.2, there is no surface outlet (i.e., pipe discharge or overflow) from the tailings basin. A transfer of water from the Rouchleau Pit to the Minntac Tailings Basin constitutes a transfer of water out of the Lake Superior Watershed and would normally require regional review and exemption through the Great Lakes Compact process. However, because water transferred out of the Lake Superior watershed by US Steel to its Minntac facility was identified as part of Minnesota’s baseline diversion and is below the permitted total of 8.797 billion gallons per year, DNR officials have indicated that a transfer from the Rouchleau Pit to the Minntac Tailings Basin would be allowed under the current baseline diversion. Implementation of this option would require an administrative amendment to US Steel’s existing water appropriation permit (1963-0846) to include the Rouchleau Pit as a water source. According to the DNR, a new appropriation permit would not be required. Once the state and federal environmental processes are concluded (i.e., state adequacy determination and federal Record of Decision), an administrative amendment could be pursued by US Steel. Rouchleau Pit water appears to be of better quality than that of the water within US Steel’s Minntac Tailings Basin, based on a partial water quality characterization from November 2012. A more comprehensive water quality characterization would need to be conducted to ensure that there are no issues with other constituents contained in the Rouchleau Pit water prior to transfer to the Minntac Tailings Basin or other receiving waterbody. A transfer of water from the Rouchleau Pit to the Minntac Tailings Basin could potentially provide benefits to Minntac with respect to the management of water quality within their tailings basin and their long term goal of minimizing effects of uncaptured basin seepage on downstream waters. A comprehensive water quality evaluation and any required permitting would have to be completed prior to implementation of a water transfer from the Rouchleau Pit to the Minntac Tailings Basin. ■ Piping Route: The pipe to direct flows to the Minntac Tailings Basin would follow the west finger at the north end of the Rouchleau Pit along the top of the pit wall, go through the backyards of a few private parcels, follow road right-of-way (ArcelorMittal plant access roads) to a power line corridor or to US 53 right-of-way, move to railroad right-of-way for a short distance to cross US 53 under an existing railroad bridge, and then move back to an overhead power line corridor (east option) or west along road corridors to US 53, following US 53 north to a power line corridor (west option). Where the power line meets the Minntac mine road, which follows the east side of the tailings basins, the pipe would follow the east side of the tailings basin perimeter dike road until it crosses under the road to the west near clear pool reservoir Cell 1. The pipe would then follow the edge of Cell 1 until it reaches the southeast corner of Cell 2 where the Rouchleau Pit water would enter the tailings basin clear pool reservoir system (see Figure 5.3-1). No permanent resource impacts would occur from the installation of these temporary pipes. There would be temporary impacts to existing vegetation, which would be restored after the pipes are removed. For additional details, see Section 5.16.1.10. These options have been reviewed by the DNR and MPCA, and these agencies have indicated that all three options could potentially provide short-term water quality improvements to these receiving waters. Construction impacts to install and remove the temporary piping for the dewatering options are addressed in Section 5.16. Bridge Option The Alternative E-1A Bridge Option would cross the Rouchleau Pit by bridge, minimizing the impact to the waterbody by avoiding most activity below the water line. Disturbance (excavation, pilings, etc.) within the waterbody would be limited to construction of bridge piers and abutments. Pier and abutment locations would be designed to minimize impacts (localized fill) on the waterbody to the extent feasible. Only localized, temporary dewatering would be required during pier/abutment construction. Water from temporary construction dewatering would be routed through a sediment basin and back into the Rouchleau Pit. Interchange and Intersection Options There would be no differences in impacts to the Rouchleau Pit resulting from the Interchange and Intersection Options given their location outside the pit. 5.3.3.3 Alternative E-2 Alternative E-2 would cross the Rouchleau Pit by bridge, minimizing the impact to the waterbody by avoiding most activity below the water line. Disturbance (excavation, pilings, etc.) within the waterbody would be limited to construction of bridge piers and abutments. Pier and abutment locations would be designed to minimize impacts (localized fill) on the pit and waterbody to the extent feasible. Only localized, temporary dewatering would be required during pier/abutment construction. Water from temporary construction dewatering would be routed through a sediment basin and back into the Rouchleau Pit. There would be no differences in impacts to the Rouchleau Pit resulting from the Interchange and Intersection Options or the Straight and Curved Setback Options given their location outside the pit. 5.3.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures 5.3.4.1 Avoidance and Minimization Physical (fill) impacts to the Rouchleau Pit would be minimized to the extent possible, depending on the alternative selected. A number of construction methods are being considered to construct the Alternative E-1A RSS Option. If the pit drawdown dewatering method were used for the RSS Option, the receiving water impacts would be minimized through standard BMPs for pumped water. Measures would be implemented within the receiving waters to avoid erosion from increased flows. The alignment of the temporary piping system has been designed to avoid significant resources by following existing disturbed corridors (roads, rails, utility corridors) and would not require grading except where road crossings are needed. 5.3.4.2 Mitigation Measures Water use, including transfers of water and dewatering for construction, are managed by the DNR through the water appropriation permit program. The DNR can include conditions in the permit requirements, if deemed necessary, to minimize and/or mitigate potential impacts. The DNR is authorized to issue longterm appropriation permits for individual uses that exceed daily and annual use volumes and has a General Permit (1997-0005) which authorizes temporary appropriations including dewatering for construction activities. If a water use meets the requirements for an Individual Appropriation Permit (i.e., if volumes exceed the General Permit conditions), an application must be completed for review by DNR. Minnesota Statutes allow local units of government 30 days to review appropriation permit applications. A transfer of water from the Rouchleau Pit to accommodate construction of the Alternative E-1A RSS Option would require a new DNR Individual Appropriation Permit, a temporary construction dewatering permit, or a modification to an existing DNR water appropriation permit, depending on the receiving water as described below. ■ Enterprise Pit: A temporary DNR water appropriation permit would be required for transferring water from the Rouchleau Pit to the Enterprise Pit. New individual permits and construction dewatering permits would be applied for by MnDOT. ■ West Two Rivers Reservoir: A transfer of water from the Rouchleau Pit to the West Two Rivers Reservoir may require a new DNR water appropriation permit. For water transfers only (no fill or discharge of dredged material), a USACE permit would not be required. ■ US Steel Minntac Tailings Basin Cell 2: An inter-basin transfer from the Rouchleau Pit to the Minntac Tailings Basin Cell 2 may require an administrative amendment to the existing US Steel Minntac appropriation permit (1963-0846) to include the Rouchleau Pit as a water source. A new appropriation permit would not be required. Once the state and federal environmental processes are concluded (i.e., state adequacy determination and federal Record of Decision), an administrative amendment could be pursued by US Steel. In addition, the transfer may require water-quality based discharge permitting from the MPCA depending on a number of factors, including whether the body of water receiving the transfer is part of an existing NPDES/SDS permit or whether there is an intervening use of the water or pollutants are added during the transfer. Generally, however, the water quality of the Rouchleau Pit is good, and water quality concerns are not anticipated if dewatering/water transfer is proposed for construction of project alternatives. US Steel’s Minntac Tailings Basin Cell 2 is part of an existing NPDES/SDS permit (Permit Number MN0057207) so a transfer of water to it would require an administrative amendment to this NPDES/SDS to implement this option. The Enterprise Pit and the West Two Rivers Reservoir are not part of existing NPDES/SDS permits and could receive a water transfer without specific NPDES/SDS permitting action. MnDOT conducted water quality sampling of the Rouchleau Pit in the spring of 2014 to document current conditions. More specific information regarding anticipated permit requirements and mitigation will be provided in the Final EIS for the preferred alternative. 5.4 Wetlands NOTE TO READER: Water resource-related issues are discussed in a number of different sections in this chapter of the Draft EIS. To facilitate cross-referencing coverage of water resources issues, the summary of topics and Draft EIS sections in the call out box may be useful. The following evaluation of potential wetland impacts within the study area is derived from the Water Resources Technical Report (Kimley-Horn, 2013), incorporated herein by reference and available in Appendix J. 5.4.1 Regulatory Context and Methodology 5.4.1.1 Regulatory Context The following agencies are involved in the review of environmental documents and, in some cases, the permitting or approval of impacts to wetland resources: ■ USACE with review by USEPA ■ MPCA ■ MnDOT under the Wetland Conservation Act (WCA) with review entities including Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR), County Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD), and DNR MnDOT, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), USEPA, and USACE have entered into the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)/Section 404 merger process for this project. Specific information pertaining to the merger process can be found in Chapter 8: Consultation and Coordination. Specific jurisdictions and regulatory and review tasks of these agencies are described in the Water Resources Technical Report (Kimley-Horn, 2013; provided in Appendix J). 5.4.1.2 Methodology The study area for wetlands included land adjacent to the project alternatives, generally extending out 500 feet or more. The areas of evaluation were defined for each alternative as described at the beginning of this chapter and are reflected in Figure 5.4-1. Wetland impacts were evaluated based on the assumption that everything within the areas of evaluation (for the No Build, Existing US 53, and M-1 Alternatives) or the representative corridors within the widened areas of evaluation (for Alternatives E-1A and E-2) would be impacted by the project. This approach addressed potential worst-case impacts and allows for the impacts to be reduced as the project layout is refined. As described in Chapter 2: Alternatives, the widened area of evaluation over the Rouchleau Pit was determined to have similar wetland impacts regardless of where the ultimate road alignment is placed within the widened area. This conclusion was based on the location of Wetlands 40, 41, and 42, which cannot be avoided (see Figure 5.4-1), and lack of wetlands throughout the rest of the widened area. The wetlands were identified based on a Level 1 assessment that utilized current digital data from the US Geological Survey (USGS), US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) National Wetlands Inventory (NWI), DNR Public Waters Inventory (PWI), and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) hydric soils data. Wetland boundaries were verified by photointerpretation, review of digital data, and a field review of wetland areas for general wetland types and characteristics conducted on June 20-21, 2012. During the field review, approximately 90 percent of the wetland areas were evaluated in the field to determine the dominant plant community/wetland type and extent of the wetland boundaries. The field-reviewed wetlands were then used as a baseline for photointerpretation to confirm wetland boundaries and types for wetland areas where access was more difficult due to terrain or heavy cover. For inaccessible areas, topographic data from the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office (two foot contours) was used to estimate wetland boundaries. Each wetland identified was given a unique identification number, and the total basin size was estimated. Each wetland was also assigned a value rating of exceptional, high, medium, or low quality, based on a qualitative assessment of diversity and integrity of the plant community using USACE’s Wetland Plants and Plant Communities of Minnesota and Wisconsin (Eggers and Reed, 1997). Wetlands were also categorized into one of five plant communities as described by Eggers and Reed, including shallow marsh (SM), wet meadow (WM), sedge meadow (SME), shrub-carr (SC), and seasonally flooded basin (SF). A Level 1 wetland delineation has been completed to date. A routine Level 2 delineation, using the methods outlined in the USACE 1987 Wetland Delineation Manual and Regional Supplement, will be conducted for the preferred alternative (May 2015), and updated wetland impact information will be provided in the Final EIS. Due to the unique construction schedule required for this project, a jurisdictional determination for each of the wetland areas will be made by USACE based on the Level 1 delineation and updated as needed after the Level 2 delineation is complete. Similarly, the MnDOT Office of Environmental Services (OES), as the local government unit implementing the Wetland Conservation Act, will make a determination of which wetlands are covered by state law and updated as new information is obtained. For the purposes of this Draft EIS, it is assumed that all identified wetland areas, including those that may have been disturbed or created as a result of prior mining or grading activities, would be regulated by the state and the USACE if impacted. The Final EIS will provide any new jurisdiction information available at that time. 5.4.2 Existing Conditions A total of 46 wetlands were identified within the study areas of the five alternatives. All wetlands identified are of medium to low quality due to disturbance from past mining and other human activities. Table 5.4-1 provides a summary of the wetlands identified along with their respective wetland types and estimated quality. 5.4.3 Environmental Consequences Table 5.4-1 also provides a summary of the wetland impacts that would occur within the area of evaluation. These impacts are described by alternative below. 5.4.3.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) The No Build Alternative does not involve any new construction and therefore would not impact any wetlands. 5.4.3.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) Under the Existing US 53 Alternative, the existing US 53 roadway is left intact to retain the current operation. No direct or indirect impacts to wetlands within or outside the existing right-of-way would occur. 5.4.3.3 Alternative M-1 Alternative M-1 is located south of existing US 53. This realignment would have the potential to impact wetlands on the north side of the existing Auburn Pit. Seven wetlands would potentially be graded or filled with a total impact of up to 8.8 acres. Construction phase impacts to wetlands would result from Alternative M-1. Temporary impacts may result from equipment access required to build the roadway and structures. However, these temporary impacts would occur entirely within the area of evaluation and therefore are not expected to be greater than those defined above. Grading and soil disturbance during construction would be mitigated through implementation of BMPs for erosion control. 5.4.3.4 Alternative E-1A Alternative E-1A is located north of existing US 53. For both the RSS and Bridge Options, this realignment would have the potential to impact 17 wetlands with a total impact of up to approximately 10.2 acres for the Intersection Option and 10.5 acres for the Interchange Option. Construction phase impacts to wetlands would result from Alternative E-1A. Temporary impacts may result from equipment access required to build the roadway and structures. However, these temporary impacts would occur entirely within the area of evaluation and therefore are not expected to be greater than those defined above. Grading and soil disturbance during construction would be mitigated through implementation of BMPs for erosion control. 5.4.3.5 Alternative E-2 Alternative E-2 is located north of existing US 53. This realignment would have the potential to impact 15 wetlands with a total impact of approximately 5.9 acres for the Intersection Option and 6.6 acres for the Interchange Option. Construction phase impacts to wetlands would result from Alternative E-2. Temporary impacts may result from equipment access required to build the roadway and structures. However, these temporary impacts would occur entirely within the area of evaluation and therefore are not expected to be greater than those defined above. Grading and soil disturbance during construction would be mitigated through implementation of BMPs for erosion control. Table 5.4-1 Wetland Impacts by Alternative A Shallow Marsh (SM), Wet Meadow (WM), Sedge Meadow (SME), Shrub-Carr (SC), and Seasonally Flooded Basin (SF) B For Alternatives E-1A and E-2, the impact area was calculated based on representative corridors averaging 200-400 feet wide and 150300 feet wide, respectively. The impacts shown in the table for Alternatives E-1A and E-2 are for the Interchange Options. The Intersection Options result in 0.3 and 0.7 acres less impact for Alternatives E-1A and E-2, respectively. For Alternative E-2, the Straight Option is represented in the table. The Curved Setback Option would result in 2.4 acres of additional wetland impact, primarily to Wetland 32. 5.4.4 Mitigation Measures 5.4.4.1 Permits and Approval Requirements Permits from the USACE (Section 404) and MPCA (Section 401 certification) will be required as part of this project. An Individual Permit is typically required for road projects with over five acres of wetland impact. Additionally, MnDOT, as the designated Local Governmental Unit (LGU), will issue a WCA wetland replacement plan approval for this project. All of these permits and approvals require documentation of sequencing, which is the evaluation of options for wetland avoidance, minimization, and mitigation. 5.4.4.2 Avoidance and Minimization Efforts have been made during alternatives development and preliminary engineering of the various alternatives to minimize wetland fill impacts to the extent possible by following previously disturbed areas (roads, mined lands). Wetland impacts have largely been avoided as part of the Scoping process; by eliminating the West Corridor alternatives from further consideration, dozens of acres of wetland impact have been avoided. A constrained cross section was assumed in some locations for the Build Alternatives to avoid various resources impacts, resulting in some additional wetland avoidance. Wetland impacts for the Build Alternatives may be further minimized by refining the project layout. A Level 2 wetland delineation will be conducted for the preferred alternative along with a jurisdictional determination by the USACE to determine the total wetland impact for the project. Updated wetland impact information will be provided in the Final EIS for the preferred alternative, determined through further coordination with the USACE and USEPA as part of the Section 404 merger process. 5.4.4.3 Mitigation Measures All previously mentioned permits and approvals require some amount of mitigation (i.e., wetland replacement). As described in the previous section, measures to further minimize wetland impacts will be considered as the conceptual layout is refined. However, it is not possible to avoid all wetland areas given the size and location of wetland areas and other constraints required to design the new road alignments; therefore, some level of wetland mitigation would be required. The current minimum wetland replacement ratio for wetland credits is 1:1 for WCA regulated impacts and 1:1for USACE regulated impacts on MnDOT road projects in the northeast part of the state if replacement is in the same Bank Service Area (BSA) as the impact and 1.5:1 if replaced outside the BSA. Discussions between MnDOT and the USACE have determined that the potential for wetland restoration is limited in the northeast and adjacent to the roadway corridor (bedrock, pit, mine dewatering); therefore, wetland replacement will likely be through use of wetland bank credits. The actual ratio applied will be determined through continued coordination with the USACE and other wetland review agencies. MnDOT has established wetland bank credits that could potentially be used for this project’s wetland mitigation requirement. MnDOT also has an agreement with BWSR regarding the creation of wetland mitigation banking sites. USACE has approved these existing MnDOT bank sites. Currently (as of December 2014), MnDOT does not have any mitigation banking sites available in northeastern Minnesota near the project area (Wetland Bank Service Areas 1, 2, and 5);7 however, MnDOT has approximately 280 acres of wetland mitigation bank credits available throughout the rest of the state.8 For purposes of this report, the nearest MnDOT wetland bank site with available wetland bank credit would be used to fulfill the wetland mitigation requirements for this project. MnDOT also has access to (i.e., has purchased) established wetland credits in the BWSR Road Bank; however, there are virtually no USACE approved wetland credits in the impact BSA as of December 2014. The BWSR Road Bank does contain several hundred USACE-approved wetland credits in the adjacent BSAs (BSA 5 and BSA 6). At the time of permitting, it is MnDOT’s intent to use the closest appropriate USACE-approved wetland credits in the BWSR Road Bank if credits are used for the wetland mitigation requirement. The feasibility of creating on-site or project-specific mitigation for the project’s wetland impact will be investigated. Areas where wetland creation would be considered include areas where existing four-lane roadway would be converted to two-lane and excess existing right-of-way is present. The average MnDOT cost for creating wetland mitigation credits is estimated at approximately $10,000 per acre of credit. Due to the previously disturbed nature of the project area, cost, mineral rights, and project timing, on-site mitigation may not be the most efficient or preferred method for replacement by the permitting agencies. 7 Map available on the BWSR website at http://www.bwsr.state.mn.us/wetlands/CBSA_WS_Cnty.pdf 8 Sarma Straumanis, Wetland Banking Specialist, MnDOT Office of Environmental Stewardship (personal communication, December 2014). 5.5 Surface Water/Water Quantity and Quality NOTE TO READER: Water resource-related issues are discussed in a number of different sections in this chapter of the Draft EIS. To facilitate cross-referencing coverage of water resources issues, the summary of topics and Draft EIS sections in the call out box may be useful. 5.5.1 Regulatory Context and Methodology 5.5.1.1 Regulatory Context The MPCA administers the NPDES Construction Stormwater Permit program in Minnesota (Minnesota Statutes, sections 115 and 116; Minnesota Rules, parts 7001 and 7090). The NPDES permit program requires creation of a project/site-specific SWPPP. The SWPPP is intended to detail the installation, inspection, and maintenance of the erosion prevention and sediment control BMPs that would be utilized before and during construction to comply with state and local water quality requirements. The NPDES permit also requires permanent stormwater management BMPs at sites where construction activity results in a net increase of more than one acre of impervious area. Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act requires states to assess all waters to determine if they meet water quality standards and conduct total maximum daily load (TMDL) studies in order to set pollutant reduction goals. Areas of the project with outlets within one mile of and that flow to MPCA-designated impaired or special waters must incorporate additional BMPs, including a stricter stormwater treatment requirement. Impaired waters within one mile of the study area have been identified; however, none of these waters would be stormwater receiving waters for this project. MPCA NPDES wet sedimentation basin BMP requirements for non-impaired waters include the following: ■ The basin must have a permanent volume of 1,800 cubic feet of storage below the outlet pipe for each acre that drains to the basin or one inch of runoff from the new impervious surface created by the project, whichever is larger ■ The basin’s permanent volume must reach a minimum depth of three feet and be no more than 10 feet deep. The basin must be configured such that scour or re-suspension of solids is minimized. ■ Basin outlets shall be designed such that the water quality volume is discharged at no more than 5.66cubic feet per second (cfs) per acre of pond surface area ■ Slopes no steeper than 1:3 above the normal water level, a 10-foot wide bench at slope 1:10 immediately above the normal water level, a 10-foot wide safety bench at slope 1:10 immediately below the normal water level, and slopes no steeper than 1:3 extending to the bottom of the pond 5.5.1.2 Methodology An analysis of the existing and proposed impervious areas was completed to determine a net increase or decrease of impervious area for each alternative. Existing impervious areas were generated using existing topographic information provided by MnDOT. The proposed impervious areas for Alternatives M-1 and E-2 were generated from the conceptual roadway layouts dated September 10, 2012 and for Alternative E-1A from a conceptual roadway layout dated October 30, 2013. The study area for stormwater was defined as the area of evaluation for each alternative as described at the beginning of this chapter (and shown in Figures 2.1-5, 2.1-6, and 2.2-1) and the surface receiving waters located adjacent to the project. The extent of the study area for impaired waters, based on state regulation, includes impaired waters that are located within one mile of the project which would also receive stormwater discharges from the project. Detailed drainage plans for the Draft EIS alternatives were not available for this analysis. Therefore, this analysis was based on the calculated change to impervious surface. This was then used to develop a rough estimate of stormwater runoff, calculated for each alternative to estimate the approximate sizing of needed stormwater ponds or treatment areas. With an overall reduction in impervious surface expected with the amount of road surface removed from the existing easement agreement area and excess rightor-way that could be used for drainage needs, this qualitative analysis provides an adequate measure of potential impact and mitigation that may be needed. 5.5.2 Existing Conditions The existing drainage patterns of the study area show surface water from the surrounding area flowing primarily towards Manganika Creek. Runoff is collected and conveyed through a series of wetlands, ditches, and culverts to generally avoid direct discharge into the Auburn and Rouchleau Pits. Stormwater flows along the north side of the existing US 53 alignment toward the 2nd Avenue interchange where it is then conveyed through a series of culverts and ditches to the west into Manganika Lake. Some of the stormwater runoff from east of the Rouchleau Pit along Landfill Road is diverted into the Minnewas Pit (see Figure 5.1-1). This diversion was constructed to utilize existing storage and prevent flooding of the Southside Park and adjacent areas. Silver Lake and Bailey Lake (identified on the DNR’s Public Waters Inventory as Virginia Lake) are identified on the Minnesota Impaired Waters List due to high levels of mercury in fish. These waters are within one mile of the project but are outside the study area for the No Build, Existing US 53, and Build Alternatives. The only named surface water in the study area of the Build Alternatives is the waterbody that has developed in the Mesabi/Rouchleau Pits (also described in Section 5.2). This groundwater-fed, man-made waterbody does not have any public access and is not identified as a DNR public water. The City of Virginia pumps potable water from the north end of this waterbody. The existing easement agreement area roadways have an estimated impervious surface area of 21 acres. 5.5.3 Environmental Consequences The calculated amount of existing impervious area varied slightly among alternatives as it included both the roadway within the existing easement agreement area plus parts of Landfill Road and US 53 outside of the existing easement agreement area based on the alternative alignments. Under all alternatives, the stormwater drainageway east of the Rouchleau Pit and north of the Midway area that flows parallel to and along the north side of US 53 would remain after MnDOT vacates the existing easement agreement area. See Chapter 7: Cumulative Impacts regarding cumulative stormwater impacts due to mining operations. 5.5.3.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) There would be a reduction in the amount of impervious surface in the existing easement agreement area where US 53 is removed. Twelve acres of US 53 existing pavement would remain primarily between Midway and MN 135. 5.5.3.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) There would be no change in impervious surface in the area or to the storm sewer system. No water quality impacts are anticipated. 5.5.3.3 Alternative M-1 Alternative M-1 applies two typical sections along the alignment. The rural typical section is proposed where possible which directs runoff from the roadway into grassed swales located within the approximately 40 foot center median and on each side of the roadway. A constrained cross section is assumed for the alignment through the Auburn Pit. Stormwater runoff would be collected and conveyed within a storm sewer system for this segment. The Alternative M-1 alignment would have a net decrease in impervious surface area (approximately 11 acres) within the study area (more pavement removed from existing roadway than added with new alignment). Per NPDES requirements, treatment of stormwater would not be required based on the net decrease in impervious surface area for the project. However, the runoff from the road section that passes through the active mine pit must be managed to avoid impact to mine dewatering operations. The stormwater features would be designed to meet the requirements of the NPDES permit for water quality treatment for the constrained cross section through the Auburn Pit. Per NPDES requirements, a permanent volume of approximately 0.8 acre-feet would be required for this segment of Alternative M-1. The size of the stormwater pond(s) would be approximately 0.3 acres in surface area and may be located in the areas shown in Figure 5.5-1. The discharge of the new pond(s) would be directed away from the existing Auburn Pit to avoid MnDOT having to purchase additional land for drainage easements. Discharge would be routed to the channel (Manganika Creek) on the west side of the Auburn Pit that ultimately drains to Manganika Lake (Figure 5.1-1). Per NPDES requirements, discharge may be limited to 5.66 cfs per acre of pond surface area for the water quality storm event. Construction activities for Alternative M-1 would be consistent with typical roadway construction. Erosion and sediment control would be provided during construction in accordance with the requirements of the MPCA and NPDES. 5.5.3.4 Alternative E-1A Alternative E-1A (RSS Option and Bridge Option) applies the same two typical sections along the alignment as Alternative M-1. The rural typical section was proposed where possible which directs runoff from the roadway into grassed swales located within the approximately 40-foot center median and on each side of the roadway. The constrained cross section was assumed for the alignment crossing through the Rouchleau Pit. Stormwater runoff would be collected and conveyed within a storm sewer system for this segment to direct it away from the Rouchleau Pit. The RSS Option would require pumping stormwater from the low point of fill to west side of pit, whereas the Bridge Option would gravity drain to the west side of the pit. The Alternative E-1A Intersection Option would decrease the impervious surface area by approximately four acres within the study area, and the Interchange Option would decrease the impervious surface area by less than 0.5 acres. Per NPDES requirements, treatment of stormwater is not required based on the net change in impervious surface area for the project. However, water quality treatment of the stormwater runoff from the constrained cross section would be included to maintain water quality of the Rouchleau Pit (Virginia’s water supply). The wet detention ponds would be designed to meet the requirements of the NPDES permit for water quality treatment for the constrained cross section. For this segment of the alignment, per NPDES requirements, a permanent volume of approximately 1.0 acre-feet would be required. The size of the stormwater pond(s) would be approximately 0.4 acres in surface area. The discharge of the new pond(s) would be directed away from the Rouchleau Pit. Discharge would be routed to the channel (Manganika Creek) on the west side of the Auburn Pit that ultimately drains to Manganika Lake (Figure 5.1-1). Potential stormwater treatment pond locations are shown in Figure 5.5-2 and are all within existing or proposed right-of-way limits. Per NPDES requirements, discharge may be limited to 5.66 cfs per acre of pond surface area for the water quality storm event. Construction activities for Alternative E-1A would be consistent with typical roadway construction with the addition of either crossing the Rouchleau Pit on a submerged haul road embankment (RSS Option) or a bridge (Bridge Option). Erosion and sediment control would be provided during construction in accordance with requirements of the MPCA and NPDES. MnDOT’s current design and maintenance practices include many BMPs, such as installing stormwater ponds, using Road Weather Information Systems, calibrating sanders for road-clearing operations, and removing snow buildup along shoulders throughout the winter. In the case of Alternative E-1A, MnDOT is also planning to collect the stormwater from the fill or bridge crossing, preventing it from draining directly into the pit. Piping would convey the stormwater to the proposed ponding identified above. 5.5.3.5 Alternative E-2 Alternative E-2 (Straight Option and Curved Setback Option) applies the same two typical sections along the alignment as Alternative M-1. The rural typical section was proposed where possible which directs runoff from the roadway into grassed swales located within the approximately 40-foot center median and on each side of the roadway. The constrained cross section was assumed for the alignment crossing through the Rouchleau Pit. Stormwater runoff would be collected and conveyed within a storm sewer system for this segment. The Alternative E-2 alignment would decrease the impervious surface area by approximately three acres with the Intersection Option, and there would be no net loss or gain of impervious surface area with the Interchange Option. Per NPDES requirements, treatment of stormwater is not required based on the net change in impervious surface area for the project. However, water quality treatment of the stormwater runoff from the constrained cross section would be included to maintain water quality of the Rouchleau Pit (Virginia’s water supply). The wet detention ponds would be designed to meet the requirements of the NPDES permit for water quality treatment for the constrained cross section. For this segment of the alignment, per NPDES requirements, a permanent volume of approximately 0.9 acre-feet would be required. The size of the stormwater pond(s) would be approximately 0.4 acres in surface area (Figure 5.5-3). The discharge of the new pond(s) would be directed away from the Rouchleau Pit. Discharge would be routed to the channel (Manganika Creek) on the west side of the Auburn Pit that ultimately drains to Manganika Lake (Figure 5.1-1). Potential stormwater treatment pond locations are shown in Figure 5.5-3 and are all within existing or proposed right-of-way limits. Per NPDES requirements, discharge may be limited to 5.66 cfs per acre of pond surface area for the water quality storm event. Construction activities for Alternative E-2 would be similar to Alternative M-1 with the addition of a bridge spanning over the Rouchleau Pit. Erosion and sediment control would be provided during construction in accordance with requirements of the MPCA and NPDES. MnDOT’s current design and maintenance practices include many BMPs, such as installing stormwater ponds, using Road Weather Information Systems, calibrating sanders for road-clearing operations, and removing snow buildup along shoulders throughout the winter. In the case of Alternative E-2, MnDOT would collect stormwater from the bridge, preventing it from draining directly into the pit. Piping on the bridge would convey stormwater to the proposed stormwater ponding identified above. 5.5.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures 5.5.4.1 Avoidance and Minimization Efforts have been made during alternatives development and preliminary engineering of the various alternatives to minimize the addition of new impervious surface to the extent possible by following previously disturbed areas (roads, mined lands). A SWPPP will be developed and implemented during construction following BMPs as required by the NPDES permit (e.g., silt fence, fiber rolls/ditch checks, temporary sediment basins, stabilization blankets, and seeding) to minimize impacts. Additional BMPs have been described to protect the Rouchleau Pit (e.g., sedimentation ponds and/or infiltration/filtration ponds) and will be developed in coordination with MPCA and MDH. Any potential contaminant spills on the road, such as gasoline, oil, and antifreeze, would be collected within the storm sewer system on the road and conveyed to treatment ponds where they could be contained for cleanup; therefore, no contaminants would be directly discharged into the pit. Emergency spills would be cleaned up as identified in MnDOT’s Emergency Spill Response Technical Memorandum (MnDOT, April 2011). 5.5.4.2 Mitigation Measures Permanent stormwater features are described above. 5.6  Geology and Soils/Soil Erosion  5.6.1  Methodology  5.6.1.1  Methodology  Background information from geologic and soil mapping was compiled to identify potential project issues and impacts. Information on soil erosion potential was used to assess whether unique conditions exist that would require special erosion prevention measures. In addition to the information provided in this section, unique soil and geologic conditions were identified that could affect project design and construction, as described in Section 5.14. 5.6.2 Existing Conditions 5.6.2.1 Geology The proposed alternatives lie within the Virginia Horn of the Mesabi Iron Range as shown in Figure 5.6-1. The Virginia Horn is a distinctive geologic feature of northeast Minnesota produced by folding of the local bedrock into an S-like curve around the city of Virginia. Taconite is mined in the Mesabi Iron Range, specifically from the Biwabik Iron Formation. This formation averages one to two miles wide in plan view and belongs to the Paleoproterozoic Animikie Group.9 The Animikie Group consists of three conformable major formations: the lowermost Pokegama Formation (predominantly quartzite); the Biwabik Iron Formation; and the uppermost Virginia Formation (predominantly argillite, siltstone, and fine-grained greywacke). The Build Alternatives would cross primarily the Biwabik Iron Formation as well as portions of the Virginia and Pokegama Formations. Collectively, these formations dip at varying altitudes and directions in the Virginia Horn area. Along the Alternative M-1, E-1A, and E-2 alignments, iron formation bedrock dips to the west and northwest at angles between five and 15 degrees. Alternatives E-1A and E-2 may cross some Archean metasediments (greywacke and slate) belonging to the Mud Lake sequence along portions and southwest of Landfill Road. Bedrock in the realignment area is collectively overlain by roughly 50 feet of glacial till and lake sediment of Wisconsinan age, as well as Upper Cretaceous age sediments and weathering residuum. 5.6.2.2 Soils The majority of the study area has been previously disturbed by past and present mining activities. The majority of the soils within the project area are dominated by a few different soil types. St. Louis County soils information was obtained from the USDA NRCS Web Soil Survey.10 Hibbing-Buhl complex, EvelethEaglenest-Conic complex, Udorthents, Rifle soils, and Urbanland-McQuade-Buhl Complex were identified as the common natural soil types within the study area. Mine pits, dumps, and tailings were also identified on the Web Soil Survey. Many of the soils within the study area were classified as rubbly, bouldery, and very bouldery with varying slopes. There were a few mucky depressional soils identified, but these were less than 10 percent of the 9 Paleoproterozoic rocks were formed about 2.5 to 1.6 billion years ago. 10 http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/WebSoilSurvey.aspx, accessed October 2012 overall study area. Drainage classes ranged from very poorly drained (Rifle soils) to well drained (EvelethEaglenest-Conic complex) (see Table 5.6-1). Table 5.6-1. Study Area Soil Types Soil Type  Drainage Class  Erosion Rating  Hibbing-Buhl Complex  Moderately well drained  Moderate  Eveleth-Eaglenest-Conic Complex  Well drained  Moderate  Udorthents  Well drained  Not rated  Rifle Soils  Very poorly drained  Slight  Urbanland-McQuade-Buhl Complex  N/A  Not rated  5.6.2.3 Erosion According the USDA NRCS Web Soil Survey, the soil types identified within the project study area have a slight to moderate probability of having erosion issues. A slight probability is defined as a low likelihood of erosion under ordinary climatic conditions. Moderate probability is defined as a high likelihood of erosion, and erosion control measures may be needed. 5.6.3 Environmental Consequences 5.6.3.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) No construction would occur under the No Build Alternative; therefore, there would be no impact on geology or soils. 5.6.3.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) No construction would occur under the Existing US 53 Alternative; therefore, there would be no impact on geology or soils. 5.6.3.3 Alternative M-1 Alternative M-1 would relocate the highway to an area south of the current alignment into the Auburn Pit. The proposed alignment crosses the Virginia Horn at a location where waste rock from the mining operation was placed to bridge the mine pit. Since this alternative involves relatively extensive areas of soil disturbance, including steep slopes within the embankment areas of the mine pit, there is a potential for conditions that may require special erosion control measures. It is expected that the steep slopes of the new road embankment will be maintained with reinforced soil slope technology. Refer to Section 5.14 for additional information regarding the engineering challenge of building on this embankment and the relative challenges among alternatives. 5.6.3.4 Alternative E-1A The alignment for Alternative E-1A crosses areas that have been disturbed previously by mining, road construction, and other activities. Outside of the Rouchleau Pit area, steep slopes that may require erosion control measures may be encountered between the new US 53 alignment and Landfill Road and where the alignment meets the pit walls on each side of the Rouchleau Pit. The RSS Option would cross the Rouchleau Pit along an existing submerged haul road embankment. Steep slopes of the new road embankment will be maintained with reinforced soil slope technology. Refer to Section 5.14 for additional information regarding the engineering challenge of building on this embankment and the relative challenges among alternatives. The Bridge Option would cross the Rouchleau Pit via a bridge. Standard BMPs for working adjacent to surface waters would be implemented to prevent stormwater runoff from entering the pit during construction of the bridge, approaches, and roadway. 5.6.3.5 Alternative E-2 The alignment for Alternative E-2 (Straight Option and Curved Setback Option) crosses areas that have been disturbed previously by mining, road construction, and other activities. Outside of the Rouchleau Pit area, steep slopes that may require erosion control measures may be encountered within newly proposed embankment areas constructed along existing high embankments found on portions of Landfill Road and where the bottom of the slope of a roughly 500-foot stretch of proposed southbound US 53 embankment intersects a high-wall present on the west side of the Rouchleau Pit and near the US 53/2nd Avenue interchange. Alternative E-2 would cross the Rouchleau Pit via a bridge. Standard BMPs for working adjacent to surface waters would be implemented to prevent storm runoff from entering the pit during construction of the bridge, approaches, and roadway. 5.6.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures Efforts have been made during alternatives development and preliminary engineering of the various alternatives to minimize grading in steep slopes and highly erodible soils to the extent possible by following previously disturbed areas (roads, mined lands). Design and construction approaches for the Build Alternatives would include a more detailed assessment of the potential for use of special erosion control measures or construction practices to minimize soil erosion. In areas where no special conditions are identified, standard erosion control BMPs for steep slopes and erodible soils would be incorporated into the roadway design plans and specifications for construction. 5.7 Noise A Noise Impacts Technical Report: US 53 DEIS Virginia-Eveleth (SBP Associates, Inc., 2014) was completed for this project (excerpts included in Appendix H; full report available on the project website).11 The following provides a summary of the findings of that analysis. 5.7.1 Noise and Noise Descriptors Noise is defined as any unwanted sound. Sound travels in a wave motion and produces a sound pressure level. This sound pressure level is commonly measured in decibels. Decibels (dB) represent the logarithmic measure of sound energy relative to a reference energy level. For highway traffic noise, an adjustment, or weighting, of the high-and low-pitched sounds is made to approximate the way that an average person hears sounds. The adjusted sound levels are stated in units of "A-weighted decibels" (dBA). A sound increase of three dBA is barely perceptible to the human ear, a five dBA increase is clearly noticeable, and a 10 dBA increase is heard twice as loud. For example, if the sound energy is doubled (e.g., the amount of traffic doubles), there is a three dBA increase in noise, which is just barely noticeable to most people. On the other hand, if traffic increases to where there is 10 times the sound energy level over a reference level, then there is a 10 dBA increase and it is heard as twice as loud. In Minnesota, traffic noise impacts are evaluated by measuring and/or modeling the traffic noise levels that are exceeded 10 percent and 50 percent of the time during the hour of the day and/or night that has 11 http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/TechnicalReports.html the loudest traffic. These numbers are identified as the L10 and L50 levels. The L10 value is compared to FHWA noise abatement criteria. The following chart12 provides a rough comparison of the noise levels of some common noise sources. Sound Pressure Level (dBA) Noise Source 140 -----------------------------Jet Engine (at 25 meters) 130 -----------------------------Jet Aircraft (at 100 meters) 120 -----------------------------Rock and Roll Concert 110 -----------------------------Pneumatic Chipper 100 -----------------------------Jointer/Planer 90 -----------------------------Chainsaw 80 -----------------------------Heavy Truck Traffic 70 -----------------------------Business Office 60 -----------------------------Conversational Speech 50 -----------------------------Library 40 -----------------------------Bedroom 30 -----------------------------Secluded Woods 20 -----------------------------Whisper Along with the volume of traffic and other factors (i.e., topography of the area and vehicle speed) that contribute to the loudness of traffic noise, the distance of a receptor from a sound’s source is also an important factor. Sound levels decrease as distance from a source increases. The following rule of thumb regarding sound decreases due to distance is commonly used: beyond approximately 50 feet, each time the distance between a line source (such as a road) and a receptor is doubled, sound levels decrease by three decibels over hard ground, such as pavement or water, and by 4.5 decibels over vegetated areas. 5.7.2 Regulatory Context 5.7.2.1 State of Minnesota Noise Regulations Minnesota State Noise Standards have been established specifically for daytime and nighttime periods. The MPCA defines daytime as 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. and nighttime as 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. For residential land uses including apartments, churches, and schools (Noise Area Classification 1 or NAC-1), the Minnesota State Standards for L10 are 65 dBA for daytime and 55 dBA for nighttime; the standards for L50 are 60 dBA for daytime and 50 dBA for nighttime. For NAC-1, the daytime standard applies during nighttime hours if the land use activity does not include overnight lodging. For commercial land uses (NAC-2), the Minnesota State Standards for L10 are 70 dBA for daytime and nighttime; the standards for L50 are 65 dBA for daytime and nighttime. Minnesota State Noise Standards are shown in Table 5.7-1. Table 5.7-1. Minnesota State Noise Standards Land Use  Code  Day (7 a.m.  10 p.m.) dBA  Night (10 p.m.  7 a.m.) dBA  Residential  NAC-1  L10 of 65  L50 of 60  L10 of 55  L50 of 50  Commercial  NAC-2  L10 of 70  L50 of 65  L10 of 70  L50 of 65  Industrial  NAC-3  L10 of 80  L50 of 75  L10 of 80  L50 of 75  12 Source: “A Guide to Noise Control in Minnesota,” MPCA, http://www.pca.state.mn.us/programs/pubs/noise.pdf; “Highway Traffic Noise,” FHWA, http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/htnoise.htm 5.7.2.2 Federal Noise Abatement Criteria (NAC) In the federal Noise Abatement Criteria (NAC), for residential and recreational uses (Federal Land Use Category B), the federal L10 standard is 70 dBA for both daytime and nighttime. For commercial and industrial areas (Federal Land Use Category C), the federal L10 standard is 75 dBA for both daytime and nighttime. Locations must be evaluated for noise abatement reasonableness where noise levels are “approaching” (defined in Minnesota as being within one decibel of the criterion threshold, i.e., 69 and 74 dBA) or exceeding the criterion level. The federal NAC are shown in Table 5.7-2. If noise levels exceed the Minnesota State Noise Standards, they would also exceed the federal NAC. In addition to the identified noise criteria, the FHWA also defines a noise impact as a “substantial increase” in the future noise levels over the existing noise levels. MnDOT considers an increase of five dBA or greater to be a substantial noise level increase. Table 5.7-2.

Noise Impact Areas for the Existing US 53, M-1, E-1A, and E-2 Alternatives For this analysis, seven potentially impacted areas (Areas A, B, C, D, E, F, and G) were defined along the US 53 corridor. Noise receptors were chosen for impact analysis within each of these areas. The areas and receptors are shown on Figure 5.7-4 and are described as follows: ■ Area A: North of US 53 and East of 12th Avenue ■ Five receptors: R15A, R15B, R15F, R16, and R17 ■ This area is primarily commercial and retail properties in addition to two religious facilities ■ Area B: City Park – Ball Fields ■ Nine receptors: R19A, R19B, R19C, R19, R19D, R19E, R20, R20A, and R20B ■ This area is the City Park ball fields on the north side of US 53 ■ Area C: Residential Area North of US 53 and East of 2nd Avenue West ■ 19 receptors: R21, R22, R23, R24, R26, R26A, R26B, R29, R30, R31, R34, R35, R36, R37, R40, R41, R43, R44, and R46 ■ This area includes residential and industrial properties north of the Existing US 53 corridor and east of 2nd Avenue ■ Area D: South of US 53 and East of 12th Avenue ■ Six receptors: R12A, R12A2, R12B, R12C, R14, and R15 ■ This is the commercial area bordering the south side of US 53 and the residential area bordering 17th Street behind the commercial area ■ Area E: Neighborhood South of US 53 and near Southern Drive and Cottage Lane ■ Six receptors: R8, R9, R10, R10A, R12, and R13 ■ This is the residential area west of where Alternative M-1 comes into town ■ Area F: Midway Area – Vermillion Drive to Cuyuna Drive ■ 14 receptors: R2, R2B, R2C, R1, R3, R4, R5, R5A, R5B, R5C, R5D, R6, R7, and R51 ■ This area includes the businesses bordering US 53 and the residences immediately behind them ■ Area G: Bourgin Road ■ Two receptors: R51A and R51B ■ This area includes two residential properties on the west side of Bourgin Road north of the Midway area Existing and 2037 noise levels were determined at the receptors in each of these areas for the Existing US 53, M-1, E-1A, and E-2 Alternatives. 5.7.3.2 Impacts Methodology and Assumptions Existing and future (2037) noise levels were modeled using the noise analysis software MINNOISEV3.1, a modified version of the FHWA noise prediction model STAMINA 2.0. The following assumptions were used in assessing corridor noise impacts: ■ Traffic data for existing conditions, 2017, and 2037 for the study area was provided in the Traffic Analysis Technical Report (CH2M Hill, 2013). The US 53 corridor modeling is based on the summer peak-hour values of 10 percent of annual average daily traffic (AADT) for daytime peak-hour and 3.5 percent of AADT for nighttime peak-hour. ■ Traffic speed limits used in the modeling are: ■ US 53: 45 mph west of 6th Avenue and 55 mph east of 6th Avenue ■ MN 37 North: 30 mph in downtown Gilbert, 40 mph west side of Gilbert, and 55 mph west of Gilbert ■ Co. 7: 55 mph south of Tamarack Drive and 30 mph north of Tamarack Drive ■ Co. 101: 30 mph in Eveleth and 55 mph west of Eveleth ■ MN 37 South: 55 mph ■ The analysis assumed acoustically soft ground cover between the roadway and all receptor locations Traffic noise impacts were assessed by modeling daytime and nighttime peak noise hour existing and 2037 Build and No Build noise levels at receptor sites located within the study area. MnDOT Automatic Traffic Recorder (ATR) data was used to model noise levels at two representative receptors to determine the highest noise hour of the day. The results are included in Appendix H. For this analysis, the hourly data that contained the highest AADT and the highest truck volumes were analyzed. With this methodology, there would be no higher noise hour because either the truck volume would be lower, the AADT would be lower, or both, and there would therefore be lower noise levels. For the portion of the project north of MN 135, the peak daytime noise hour was found to be from 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. For the portion of the project south of MN 135, the peak daytime noise hour was found to be from 3:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. The highest nighttime noise hour is between 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m., which has the highest total AADT and truck trips between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. For the No Build Alternative, levels of service are expected to be poor throughout most of the day and worse than for all other alternatives due to significantly more traffic traversing fewer roadway lanes. As a result, travel speeds are expected to be slower than for other alternatives throughout most of the day along the alternate routes. For the No Build Alternative, peak noise hour traffic assumes traffic speeds at five mph less than posted during an hour when volume is about half of the peak volume. This is a conservative approach that will result in all potential noise impacts to represent the worst case. Noise modeling receptors were selected at commercial, industrial, and residential sites along the alternative corridors. Receptor locations were chosen based on guidance provided in Appendix B of the June 1, 2011 MnDOT Noise Policy. 5.7.4 Noise Monitoring In addition to noise modeling, noise monitoring was also conducted at locations along the project corridor to assist in defining existing noise levels and to validate the model. Monitoring locations are shown in Figures 5.7-1 and 5.7-2. A comparison of monitored and modeled noise levels is provided in the Noise Impacts Technical Report (SBP Associates, 2013). The modeled traffic volumes were based on traffic counts conducted during the monitoring. The model shows good agreement (within three dBA) with the monitoring results for all monitoring periods. 5.7.5 Noise Impacts Modeling Results 5.7.5.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) Roadways expected to have significantly increased traffic volumes under the No Build Alternative include the following: ■ Co. 7 ■ MN 37 North ■ MN 37 South ■ Co. 101 Traffic volumes would be substantially reduced along the existing US 53 corridor between MN 37 on the south and US 169 on the north, resulting in reduced noise levels along the corridor in Virginia. See Figure 5.7-1 for the noise impacts along the No Build Alternative reroute roadways. Co. 7 Receptors P43, P43A, C43A, P45, P46, P47, P47, P48, P49, P49A, P49B, P50, P51, P52, P53, P53A, P55, P57-2, P57A, P57B, P57D, P63, P66, P67, P70-3, P70A, P70B, P71, P71A, P71B, P72, P73, P75, P77, P78, P83, P84, P92, P92A, P92B, P93, P96, C97, P101, P103, P108, P108A, P108B, P108C, P108D, P108E, P108F, P108G, C109, P109, P109A, P109B, P109C, P109D, P109E, P109F, P110, P111, P112, C114, P114, P117, P117A, C118, and P118 Co. 7 is the main north-south alternative to US 53. The noise levels were modeled at 70 receptor locations along this roadway between MN 37 and US 169. With the existing transportation network, in 2017 two of the modeled locations would exceed the daytime Minnesota residential noise standards, and 27 of the modeled locations would exceed the nighttime Minnesota residential noise standards. Under the 2037 No Build conditions, 22 of the modeled locations would exceed the daytime Minnesota residential noise standards, and 50 of the modeled locations would exceed the nighttime Minnesota residential noise standards. The modeled L10 noise level increase ranges from 3.1 to 8.6 dBA during the peak daytime hour and from 4.3 to 10.7 dBA during the peak nighttime hour. MnDOT noise policy considers a noise level increase of five dBA or more to be significant. Complete model results for this corridor are provided in Table B-1 of Appendix H. MN 37 South – US 53 to Co. 7 Receptors P0, P1, P2, P3, P3A, P11, P11A, P11B, P11C, P12, P12A, P13, P14, P15, P16, P17, P17A, P18, P19, P20, P21, P21A, P22, P22A, P23, P24, P24A, P25, P26, P36, P37, P38, P39, P40, P41, P42, P42A MN 37 would serve as a route from US 53 to Co. 7 should the segment of US 53 within the existing easement agreement area be removed. Noise levels were modeled at 37 receptor locations along this roadway between US 53 and Co. 7. With the existing transportation network, in 2017 none of the modeled locations would exceed the daytime Minnesota residential noise standards, and 23 of the modeled locations would exceed the nighttime Minnesota residential noise standards. Under the 2037 No Build conditions, 10 of the modeled locations would exceed the daytime Minnesota residential noise standards, and 30 of the modeled locations would exceed the nighttime Minnesota residential noise standards. The modeled L10 noise level increase ranges from 2.3 to 2.9 dBA during the peak daytime hour and from 3.2 to 6.8 dBA during the peak nighttime hour.

The noise levels were modeled at 12 receptor locations along this roadway between US 53 and Co. 7. With the existing transportation network, in 2017 none of the modeled locations would exceed the daytime Minnesota residential noise standards, and 10 of the modeled locations would exceed the nighttime Minnesota residential noise standards. Under the 2037 No Build conditions, eight of the modeled locations would exceed the daytime Minnesota residential noise standards, and all 12 of the modeled locations would exceed the nighttime Minnesota residential noise standards. The modeled L10 noise level increase ranges from 2.7 to 3.2 dBA during the peak daytime hour and from 6.5 to 7.6 dBA during the peak nighttime hour. MnDOT noise policy considers a noise level increase of greater five dBA or more to be significant. Complete model results for this corridor are provided in Table B-3 of Appendix H. MN 37 North – US 53 to MN 135 in Gilbert Receptors N72, N73, N74, N77, N77A, N78, N81, N83, N84, N88, N93, N94, N95, N99, N99A, and N101 MN 37 would serve as a route from US 53 to MN 135 in Gilbert under the No Build Alternative. Noise levels were modeled at 16 receptor locations along this roadway between US 53 and MN 135. With the existing transportation network, in 2017 two of the modeled locations would exceed the daytime Minnesota residential noise standards, and eight of the modeled locations would exceed the nighttime Minnesota residential noise standards. Under the 2037 No Build conditions, four of the modeled locations would exceed the daytime Minnesota residential noise standards, and 12 of the modeled locations would exceed the nighttime Minnesota residential noise standards. The modeled L10 noise level increase is from 1.7 to 2.0 dBA during the peak daytime hour and from 3.4 to 4.4 dBA during the peak nighttime hour. MnDOT noise policy considers a noise level increase of five dBA or more to be significant. Complete model results for this corridor are provided in Table B-4 of Appendix H. US 53 Corridor – Between MN 37 South and US 169 This portion of US 53 would see substantial reduction in traffic under this alternative. The portion south of the mine will serve the Midway area, and the portion north of the mine will serve local traffic in Virginia. Because of the substantial decrease in traffic in these areas under the 2037 No Build conditions, noise levels would be substantially reduced (by up to 10 dBA in some locations).

When traffic noise impacts are identified, noise abatement shall be considered and evaluated for feasibility and reasonableness. Feasibility deals primarily with engineering considerations. Reasonableness is based on three required criteria but may be influenced by the consideration of optional criteria. A determination of feasibility and reasonableness includes these minimum required criteria: ■ Acoustic Feasibility: At least a five dBA highway traffic noise reduction is achieved at the majority of the impacted receivers ■ At least one receptor per proposed noise barrier must receive the five dBA reduction to achieve acoustic feasibility ■ Engineering Feasibility: Determination that it is possible to design and construct the noise abatement measure ■ Considers constructability factors such as safety, barrier height, topography, drainage, utilities, and maintenance ■ Reasonableness: Consideration of the viewpoints of benefited residents and owners ■ MnDOT will provide project information and solicit the viewpoints of all of the benefited receptors via phone calls, websites, direct mailings, or in-person meetings ■ The desires of the benefited property owners and residents regarding the construction of proposed noise abatement will be expressed in a vote that will be weighted based on proximity to the proposed improvements ■ A simple majority (greater than 50 percent) of all possible voting points for each potential noise abatement measure must vote down the abatement measure to remove it from further consideration ■ Reasonableness: Allowable cost of highway traffic noise abatement ■ MnDOT has determined a cost effectiveness threshold of $43,500 per individual benefited receptor ■ Reasonableness: Meets or exceeds the noise reduction design goal ■ MnDOT noise policy establishes a noise reduction design goal of at least seven dBA. This design goal must be achieved at a minimum of one benefited receptor for each proposed noise abatement measure to be considered reasonable. The reasonableness factors listed must collectively be achieved in order for a noise abatement measure to be deemed reasonable. Failure to achieve any one factor will result in the noise abatement measure being deemed not reasonable. The noise barriers analyzed are shown in Figures 5.7-3 through 5.7-5. Following is a description of the mitigation assessment for each of the alternatives. 5.7.6.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) For the No Build Alternative, sensitive receptor locations along Co. 7, MN 37, and Co. 101 would experience substantial (greater than five dBA) noise level increases due to the increase in traffic volumes during both daytime and nighttime hours. Additionally, the forecast traffic volumes would cause Minnesota noise standards to be exceeded at locations along each of these existing roadways. However, by definition, the No Build Alternative would not include any mitigation measures. 5.7.6.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) Because this alternative consists of leaving everything in place with no new construction, no mitigation assessment has been completed. 5.7.6.3 Alternative M-1 This alternative potentially impacts Areas A, B, C, D, E, and F. The impact assessment found that Areas D, E, and F have modeled noise levels exceeding Minnesota standards at modeled receptor locations. The noise walls described below are located within the area of evaluation for Alternative M-1, except for a portion of the wall at the west end of Area D. However, the wall at Area D was found to not be feasible or reasonable and, therefore, would require no new right-of-way or impact analysis. Area D: South of US 53 and East of 12th Avenue Receptors R14, R15, R12A, R12A2, R12B, and R12C A 1,100-foot long wall was analyzed for this site. The cost per residence achieving a five dBA reduction is $220,000 for a 20-foot tall wall and $165,000 for a 15-foot tall wall, exceeding the cost-effectiveness requirement of $43,500 per impacted residence. A 10-foot tall wall would not achieve the seven dBA minimum reduction at any receptor. The wall analysis calculations for this area are summarized in Table D-1 in Appendix H. Area E: Neighborhood South of US 53 and near Southern Drive and Cottage Lane Receptors R8, R9, R10, R10A, R12, and R13 A 2,017-foot long wall was analyzed for this site. A 20-foot tall wall would not achieve the minimum seven dBA reduction at any receptor. The wall analysis calculations for this area are summarized in Table D-2 in Appendix H. Area F: Midway Area – Vermillion Drive to Cuyuna Drive Receptors R2, R2B, R2C, R1, R3, R4, R5, R5A, R5B, R5C, R5D, R6, R7, and R51 A 1,366-foot long wall was analyzed for this site. With a 20-foot tall barrier, the cost per residence achieving a five dBA reduction is $32,141, meeting the cost-effectiveness requirement of $43,500 per residence. Therefore, a noise barrier may be further evaluated for this location. The wall analysis calculations for this area are summarized in Table D-3 in Appendix H. 5.7.6.4 Alternative E-1A (RSS Option and Bridge Option) This alternative potentially impacts Areas A, B, C, F, and G. The impact assessment found that Areas C, F, and G have modeled noise levels exceeding Minnesota standards at modeled receptor locations. The noise walls described below are located within the area of evaluation for Alternative E-1A. Area C: Residential Area North of US 53 and East of 2nd Avenue West Receptors R21, R22, R23, R24, R26, R26A, R26B, R29, R30, R31, R34, R35, R36, R37, R40, R41, R43, R44, and R46 An 805-foot long wall was analyzed for this site. With a 20-foot tall barrier, the cost per receptor achieving a five dBA reduction is $46,000, not meeting the cost-effectiveness requirement of $43,500. Therefore, a noise barrier would likely not be further evaluated for this location. The wall was analyzed for shortened height and shortened length to determine whether it could be cost-effective. It was found that a wall length shorter than 805 feet would result in two receptors obtaining a noise level reduction that is less than five dBA. This would reduce the number of benefitted receptors and, therefore, would be less cost-effective. Similar to shortening the wall length, reducing the height from 20 feet to 19 feet would result in fewer benefitted receptors, making the wall less cost-effective. The wall analysis calculations for this area are summarized in Table D-4 in Appendix H. Area F: Midway Area – Vermillion Drive to Cuyuna Drive Receptors R2, R2B, R2C, R1, R3, R4, R5, R5A, R5B, R5C, R5D, R6, R7, and R51 An 837-foot long wall was analyzed for this site. With a 20-foot tall barrier, the cost per residence achieving a five dBA reduction is $33,480 for daytime peak-hour traffic conditions and $41,850 for nighttime peak-hour conditions, both meeting the cost-effectiveness requirement of $43,500 per residence. Therefore, a noise barrier may be further evaluated for this location. The wall analysis calculations for this area are summarized in Table D-5 in Appendix H. Area G: Bourgin Road Receptors R51A and R51B A 417–foot long wall was analyzed for this site. It did not achieve a minimum of seven dBA reduction at either receptor location. Therefore, a noise barrier would likely not be further evaluated for this location. The wall analysis calculations for this area are summarized in Table D-6 for the Intersection Option and Table D-6A for the Interchange Option in Appendix H. 5.7.6.5 Alternative E-2 Both the Straight Option and the Curved Setback Option potentially impact Area C. The Curved Setback Option would also potentially impact Areas F and G, as described for Alternative E-1A in Section 5.7.6.4. The noise wall described below is located within the area of evaluation for Alternative E-2. Area C: Residential Area North of US 53 and East of 2nd Avenue West Receptors R21, R22, R23, R24, R26, R26A, R26B, R29, R30, R31, R34, R35, R36, R37, R40, R41, R43, R44, and R46 A 1,070-foot long wall was analyzed for this site. With a 20-foot tall barrier, the cost per residence achieving a five dBA reduction is $42,800, meeting the cost-effectiveness requirement of $43,500 per residence. Therefore, a noise barrier may be further evaluated for this location.13 The wall analysis calculations for this area are summarized in Table D-7 in Appendix H. 5.7.7 Conclusions This analysis is based on preliminary information. A final determination would involve a more detailed analysis with final design information and input from residents and landowners. A refined mitigation analysis may be conducted for the preferred alternative, if necessary, to confirm if/where noise abatement may be feasible and reasonable based on final design details. 5.7.7.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) Roadways expected to have substantially increased traffic volumes under the No Build Alternative include Co. 7, MN 37 South, MN 37 North, and Co. 101. Traffic volumes would be substantially reduced along the existing US 53 corridor between MN 37 on the south and US 169 on the north, resulting in reduced noise levels along the corridor in Virginia. Under the No Build Alternative, sensitive receptor locations along Co. 7, MN 37, and Co. 101 would experience substantial (greater than five dBA) noise level increases due to the increase in traffic volumes during both daytime and nighttime hours. Additionally, the increased traffic volumes would cause Minnesota noise standards to be exceeded at locations along each of these existing roadways. This alternative impacts a very large area. Some residential areas along these roadways could meet the cost-reasonableness criteria for mitigation with a barrier. However, by definition, the No Build Alternative would not include any mitigation measures, unless it were selected as the preferred alternative. 5.7.7.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) Under this alternative design, year 2037 noise levels would increase by approximately one dBA compared to current levels. This modeled increase is due to traffic volume growth over time. Because this alternative does not involve any construction or changes in traffic patterns, no mitigation assessment has been conducted. 13 A noise barrier was found to be reasonable for Alternative E-2 in Area C but not for Alternative E-1A. The Alternative E-1A alignment is farther from the receptors so the noise level increase is less than for Alternative E-2. The cost per receptor to achieve a five dBA reduction exceeded the cost-effectiveness requirement for Alternative E-1A; therefore, a noise barrier in Area C was determined to not be reasonable for that alternative. 5.7.7.3 Alternative M-1 This alternative potentially impacts Areas A, B, C, D, E, and F. The impact assessment found that Areas D, E, and F have modeled noise levels that would exceed Minnesota standards at modeled receptor locations. The mitigation assessment determined that noise barriers at Areas D and E would not meet MnDOT cost-reasonableness criteria under this alternative. Area F met the cost-effectiveness requirement of $43,500 per residence; therefore, a noise barrier would be further evaluated for this location under this alternative. 5.7.7.4 Alternative E-1A (RSS Option and Bridge Option) This alternative potentially impacts Areas A, B, C, F, and G. The impact assessment determined that Areas A and B meet Minnesota standards. The mitigation assessment determined that noise barriers at Area C and G did not meet MnDOT cost-reasonableness criteria. Area F met the cost-effectiveness requirement of $43,500; therefore, a noise barrier may be further evaluated for this location under this alternative. 5.7.7.5 Alternative E-2 The Straight Option and Curved Setback Option potentially impact Area C. Area C includes residential and industrial properties adjacent to where Alternative E-2 comes into Virginia. Under this alternative, modeled noise levels exceed Minnesota daytime and nighttime standards at residential receptors in this area. Area C met the cost-effectiveness requirement of $43,500 per residence; therefore, a noise barrier may be further evaluated for this location. The Curved Setback Option would also potentially impact Areas F and G. The mitigation assessment determined that noise barriers at Area G did not meet MnDOT cost-reasonableness criteria. Area F met the cost-effectiveness requirement of $43,500; therefore, a noise barrier may be further evaluated for this location under this option. 5.8 Transportation-Related Air Quality Per the Scoping Decision Document (February 2012),14 transportation-related air quality was assessed qualitatively, consistent with FHWA Interim Guidelines for Mobile Source Air Toxics (MSATs) Analysis and the USEPA-approved hotspot screening method for emissions. The project is not located in an area where conformity requirements apply. 5.8.1 Regulatory Context and Methodology The purpose of the Clean Air Act legislation and NEPA regulation is to protect health and welfare by attaining and maintaining the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). At the project level, NEPA documentation of transportation-related air quality impacts primarily addresses localized emissions of carbon monoxide and MSATs and is performed to assure that violations of the NAAQS would not occur because of the proposed project. 5.8.1.1 NAAQS Criteria Pollutants Motorized vehicles affect air quality by emitting airborne pollutants. Changes in traffic volumes, travel patterns, and roadway locations affect air quality by changing the number of vehicles and the congestion levels in a given area. The air quality impacts from the proposed project were analyzed by addressing criteria pollutants, a group of common air pollutants regulated by USEPA on the basis of criteria (information on health and/or environmental effects of pollution). The criteria pollutants identified by the USEPA are ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, lead, and sulfur dioxide. 14 Available at http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/scoping.html Potential impacts resulting from these pollutants are assessed by comparing project concentrations to the NAAQS. A brief description of each criteria pollutant and an assessment of its relevance to this project are provided below. Ozone Ground-level ozone is a primary constituent of smog and is a pollution problem throughout many areas of the United States. Exposures to ozone can make people more susceptible to respiratory infection, resulting in lung inflammation, and aggravate preexisting respiratory diseases such as asthma. Ozone is not emitted directly from vehicles but is formed when volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) react in the presence of sunlight. Transportation sources emit NOx and VOCs and can therefore affect ozone concentrations. However, due to the phenomenon of atmospheric formation of ozone from chemical precursors, concentrations are not expected to be elevated near a particular roadway. The MPCA, in cooperation with various other agencies, industries, and groups, has encouraged voluntary control measures for ozone and has begun developing a regional ozone modeling effort. Ozone concentrations in the lower atmosphere are influenced by a complex relationship of precursor concentrations, meteorological conditions, and regional influences on background concentrations. MPCA states in Air Quality in Minnesota: 2013 Report to the Legislature (January 2013) that: “All areas of Minnesota currently meet the federal ambient eight-hour standard for ozone, but Minnesota is at risk for being out of compliance. In 2008, USEPA tightened the federal eight-hour ambient air standard for ozone to 75 parts per billion (ppb). USEPA plans to propose a revised ozone standard in September 2013, with a final standard planned for 2014. Preliminary documents indicate that USEPA believes the scientific evidence on the health impacts of ozone shows that the current ambient standard is insufficient to protect public health. USEPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee has recommended that a new ambient standard be set in the range of 60-70 ppb to ensure public health protection with an adequate margin of safety. In 2010, USEPA proposed a revised ozone standard in the range of 60-70 ppb but withdrew the proposal in fall 2011. Many areas of Minnesota would not meet the revised standard if the USEPA sets the standard at the lowest end of the advisory committee’s recommended range.” The project is located in an area that has been designated as an unclassifiable/attainment area for ozone. This means that the project area has been identified as a geographic area that meets the national health-based standards for ozone levels and, therefore, is exempt from performing further ozone analyses. Particulate Matter Particulate matter (PM) is the term for particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air. Particles come in a wide variety of sizes and have been historically assessed based on size, typically measured by the diameter of the particle in micrometers. PM2.5, or fine particulate matter, refers to particles that are 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter. PM10 refers to particulate matter that is 10 micrometers or less in diameter. Motor vehicles (i.e., cars, trucks, and buses) emit direct PM from their tailpipes, as well as from normal brake and tire wear. Vehicle dust from paved and unpaved roads may be re-entrained, or re-suspended, in the atmosphere. In addition, PM2.5 can be formed in the atmosphere from gases such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and VOCs. PM2.5 can penetrate the human respiratory system's natural defenses and damage the respiratory tract when inhaled. Numerous scientific studies have linked particle pollution exposure to a variety of problems, including: ■ Premature death in people with heart or lung disease ■ Nonfatal heart attacks ■ Aggravated asthma ■ Decreased lung function ■ Increased respiratory systems, such as irritation of the airways, coughing, or difficulty breathing15 On December 14, 2014, the USEPA issued a final rule revising the annual health NAAQS for fine particles (PM2.5). The USEPA website states: “With regard to primary (health-based) standards for fine particles (generally referring to particles less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers (µm) in diameter, PM2.5), the USEPA is strengthening the annual PM2.5 standard by lowering the level to 12.0 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3). The existing annual standard, 15.0 µg/m3, was set in 1997. The USEPA is revising the annual PM2.5 standard to 12.0 µg/m3 so as to provide increased protection against health effects associated with long-and short-term exposures (including premature mortality, increased hospital admissions and emergency department visits, and development of chronic respiratory disease) and to retain the 24-hour PM2.5 standard at a level of 35 µg/m3 (the USEPA issued the 24-hour standard in 2006). The USEPA is revising the Air Quality Index (AQI) for PM2.5 to be consistent with the revised primary PM2.5 standards.”16 The USEPA also retained the existing standards for coarse particular pollution (PM10). The NAAQS 24hour standard for PM10 is 150 µg/m3 which is not to be exceeded more than once per year on average over three years. The Clean Air Act conformity requirements include the assessment of localized air quality impacts of federally-funded or federally-approved transportation projects that are located within PM2.5 nonattainment and maintenance areas and deemed to be projects of air quality concern. The project is located in an area that has been designated as an unclassifiable/attainment area for PM. This means that the project area has been identified as a geographic area that meets the national health-based standards for PM levels and, therefore, is exempt from performing PM analyses. Nitrogen Dioxide (Nitrogen Oxides) Nitrogen oxides (NOx) is the generic term for a group of highly reactive gases, all of which contain nitrogen and oxygen in varying amounts. Nitrogen oxides form when fuel is burned at high temperatures, as in a combustion process. The primary sources of NOx are motor vehicles, electric utilities, and other industrial, commercial, and residential sources that burn fuels. The MPCA’s Air Quality in Minnesota: 2013 Report to the Legislature (January 2013) indicates that: “On-road gasoline vehicles and diesel vehicles account for 44 percent of NOx emissions in Minnesota. In addition to being a precursor to ozone, NOx can worsen respiratory irritation and increase risk of premature death from heart or lung disease.” Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is a form of nitrogen oxide (NOx), is regularly monitored in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. Minnesota currently meets federal NO2 standards according to the 2013 Annual Air Monitoring Network Plan (July 2012). A monitoring site meets the annual NAAQS for NO2 if the annual average is less than or equal to 53 ppb. The 2011 Minnesota NO2 monitoring site averages ranged from 5 ppb to 9 ppb; therefore, Minnesota currently meets the annual NAAQS for NO2. The USEPA’s regulatory announcement, EPA420-F-99-051 (December 1999), described the Tier 2 standards for tailpipe emissions and stated: “The new tailpipe standards are set at an average standard of 0.07 grams per mile for nitrogen oxides for all classes of passenger vehicles beginning in 2004. This includes all light-duty trucks, as well as the largest SUVs. Vehicles weighing less than 6,000 pounds will be phased in to this standard between 2004 and 2007. As newer, cleaner cars enter the national fleet, the new tailpipe standards will significantly reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides from vehicles by about 74 percent by 2030. The standards also will 15 Source: http://www.epa.gov/air/particlepollution/health.html 16 Source: http://www.epa.gov/pm/actions.html reduce emissions by more than two million tons per year by 2020 and nearly three million tons annually by 2030.” Within the project area, it is unlikely that NO2 standards will be approached or exceeded based on the relatively low ambient concentrations of NO2 in Minnesota and on the long-term trend toward reduction of NO2 emissions. Because of these factors, a specific analysis of NO2 was not conducted for this project. Sulfur Dioxide Sulfur dioxide (SO2) and other sulfur oxide gases (SOx) are formed when fuel containing sulfur, such as coal, oil, and diesel fuel, is burned. Sulfur dioxide is a heavy, pungent, colorless gas. Elevated levels can impair breathing, lead to other respiratory symptoms, and, at very high levels, aggravate heart disease. People with asthma are most at risk when SO2 levels increase. Once emitted into the atmosphere, SO2 can be further oxidized into sulfuric acid, a component of acid rain. The MPCA’s Annual Pollution Report to the Legislature: A Summary of Minnesota’s Air Emissions and Water Discharges (April 2011) indicates that on-road mobile sources account for just 14 percent of SO2 emissions in Minnesota. Over 53 percent of SO2 released into the air comes from electric utilities, especially those that burn coal. MPCA monitoring shows that ambient SO2 concentrations are consistently below standards. The MPCA has concluded that long-term trends in both ambient air concentrations and total SO2 emissions in Minnesota indicate steady improvement. Emissions of sulfur oxides from transportation sources are a small component of overall emissions and continue to decline due to the desulphurization of fuels. Additionally, Minnesota is classified by the USEPA as a sulfur dioxide attainment area, which means that Minnesota has been identified as a geographic area that meets or exceeds the national standards for the reduction of sulfur dioxide levels. Because of these factors, a quantitative analysis for sulfur dioxide was not conducted for this project. Lead Due to the phase out of leaded gasoline, lead is no longer a pollutant associated with vehicular emissions. Carbon Monoxide (Hot Spot Analysis) Carbon monoxide is the traffic-related pollutant that has been of concern in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. However, this project is not located in an area where conformity requirements apply, and the scope of the project does not indicate that air quality impacts would be expected. Furthermore, the USEPA has approved a screening method to determine which intersections need hot-spot analysis. The benchmark annual average daily traffic (AADT) volume for hot-spot analysis is 79,400. The highest volume intersection for any of the project alternatives is below this threshold. MnDOT has demonstrated by the results of the screening procedure that there are no signalized intersections included in this project area that require hot-spot analysis. Therefore, no further air quality analysis is necessary. Additionally, in Minnesota, USEPA Conformity Rule requirements apply to the Twin Cities metropolitan area, the city of Duluth, and the city of St. Cloud. The city of Virginia is not within an area where Conformity Rule requirements apply. 5.8.1.2 Mobile Source Air Toxics (MSATs) In addition to the criteria air pollutants, the USEPA also regulates air toxics. There are no established criteria for determining when MSATs emissions become a significant issue in the NEPA context because it is still an emerging science. FHWA provides guidance for the analysis of transportation-related air quality in NEPA documentation in its December 6, 2012 document, “Interim Guidance Update on Mobile Source Air Toxic Analysis in NEPA.” The following discussion of MSATs applicability to the proposed project is based upon this FHWA guidance. Background Controlling air toxics emissions became a national priority with the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, whereby Congress mandated that the USEPA regulate 188 air toxics, also known as hazardous air pollutants. The USEPA has assessed this expansive list in their latest rule on the Control of Hazardous Air Pollutants from Mobile Sources17 and identified a group of 93 compounds emitted from mobile sources that are listed in their Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS).18 In addition, USEPA identified seven compounds with significant contributions from mobile sources that are among the national and regional-scale cancer risk drivers from their 1999 National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA).19 These are acrolein, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, diesel particulate matter plus diesel exhaust organic gases (diesel PM), formaldehyde, naphthalene, and polycyclic organic matter. While FHWA considers these the priority mobile source air toxics, the list is subject to change and may be adjusted in consideration of future USEPA rules. The USEPA rule requires controls that will dramatically decrease MSATs emissions through cleaner fuels and cleaner engines. Based on an FHWA analysis using USEPA’s MOVES2010b model, as shown in Figure 5.8-1, even if vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) increases by 102 percent as assumed from 2010 to 2050, a combined reduction of 83 percent in the total annual emissions for the priority MSATs is projected for the same time period. Air toxics analysis is a continuing area of research. While much work has been done to assess the overall health risk of air toxics, many questions remain unanswered. In particular, the tools and techniques for assessing project-specific health outcomes as a result of lifetime MSATs exposure remain limited. These limitations impede the ability to evaluate how the potential health risks posed by MSATs exposure should be factored into project-level decision-making within the context of the NEPA. Nonetheless, air toxics concerns continue to be raised on highway projects during the NEPA process. Even as the science emerges, we are duly expected by the public and other agencies to address MSATs impacts in our environmental documents. The FHWA, USEPA, Health Effects Institute (HEI), and others have funded and conducted research studies to try to more clearly define potential risks from MSATs emissions associated with highway projects. The FHWA will continue to monitor the developing research in this emerging field. NEPA Context NEPA requires, to the fullest extent possible, that the policies, regulations, and laws of the federal government be interpreted and administered in accordance with its environmental protection goals. NEPA also requires federal agencies to use an interdisciplinary approach in planning and decision-making for any action that adversely impacts the environment. NEPA requires and FHWA is committed to the examination and avoidance of potential impacts to the natural and human environment when considering approval of proposed transportation projects. In addition to evaluating the potential environmental effects, the need for safe and efficient transportation must be taken into account in reaching a decision that is in the best overall public interest. FHWA policies and procedures for implementing NEPA are prescribed by regulation in 23 CFR 771. 17 Federal Register, Vol. 72, No. 37, page 8430, February 26, 2007 18 http://www.epa.gov/ncea/iris/index.html 19 http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nata1999/ Figure 5.8-1. National MSATs Emission Trends (2010-2050) for Vehicles Operating on Roadways Using USEPA’s MOVES2010b Model Note: Trends for specific locations may be different, depending on locally derived information representing vehicle-miles traveled, vehicle speeds, vehicle mix, fuels, emission control programs, meteorology, and other factors Source: USEPA MOVES2010b model runs conducted during May -June 2012 by FHWA. Incomplete or Unavailable Information for Project-Specific MSATs Health Impact Analysis In FHWA's view, information is incomplete or unavailable to credibly predict the project-specific health impacts due to changes in MSATs emissions associated with a proposed set of highway alternatives. The outcome of such an assessment, adverse or not, would be influenced more by the uncertainty introduced into the process through assumption and speculation rather than any genuine insight into the actual health impacts directly attributable to MSATs exposure associated with a proposed action. The USEPA is responsible for protecting the public health and welfare from any known or anticipated effect of an air pollutant. They are the lead authority for administering the Clean Air Act and its amendments and have specific statutory obligations with respect to hazardous air pollutants and MSATs. The USEPA is in the continual process of assessing human health effects, exposures, and risks posed by air pollutants. They maintain the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), which is "a compilation of electronic reports on specific substances found in the environment and their potential to cause human health effects."20 Each report contains assessments of non-cancerous and cancerous effects for individual compounds and quantitative estimates of risk levels from lifetime oral and inhalation exposures with uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of magnitude. 20 USEPA, http://www.epa.gov/ncea/iris/index.html Other organizations are also active in the research and analyses of the human health effects of MSATs, including HEI. Two HEI studies are summarized in Appendix D of FHWA's Interim Guidance Update on Mobile Source Air Toxic Analysis in NEPA Documents. Among the adverse health effects linked to MSATs compounds at high exposures are cancer in humans in occupational settings; cancer in animals; and irritation to the respiratory tract, including the exacerbation of asthma. Less obvious is the adverse human health effects of MSATs compounds at current environmental concentrations21 or in the future as vehicle emissions substantially decrease.22 The methodologies for forecasting health impacts include emissions modeling; dispersion modeling; exposure modeling; and then final determination of health impacts, each step in the process building on the model predictions obtained in the previous step. All are encumbered by technical shortcomings or uncertain science that prevents a more complete differentiation of the MSATs health impacts among a set of project alternatives. These difficulties are magnified for lifetime (i.e., 70 year) assessments, particularly because unsupportable assumptions would have to be made regarding changes in travel patterns and vehicle technology (which affects emissions rates) over that time frame since such information is unavailable. It is particularly difficult to reliably forecast 70-year lifetime MSATs concentrations and exposure near roadways, to determine the portion of time that people are actually exposed at a specific location, and to establish the extent attributable to a proposed action, especially given that some of the information needed is unavailable. There are considerable uncertainties associated with the existing estimates of toxicity of the various MSATs because of factors such as low-dose extrapolation and translation of occupational exposure data to the general population, a concern expressed by HEI.23 As a result, there is no national consensus on air dose-response values assumed to protect the public health and welfare for MSATs compounds, and in particular for diesel PM. The USEPA24 and the HEI25 have not established a basis for quantitative risk assessment of diesel PM in ambient settings. There is also a lack of national consensus on an acceptable level of risk. The current context is the process used by the USEPA as provided by the Clean Air Act to determine whether more stringent controls are required in order to provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health or to prevent an adverse environmental effect for industrial sources subject to the maximum achievable control technology standards, such as benzene emissions from refineries. The decision framework is a two-step process. The first step requires USEPA to determine a "safe" or "acceptable" level of risk due to emissions from a source, which is generally no greater than approximately 100 in a million. Additional factors are considered in the second step, the goal of which is to maximize the number of people with risks less than one in a million due to emissions from a source. The results of this statutory two-step process do not guarantee that cancer risks from exposure to air toxics are less than one in a million; in some cases, the residual risk determination could result in maximum individual cancer risks that are as high as approximately 100 in a million. In a June 2008 decision, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld USEPA's approach to addressing risk in its two-step decision framework. Information is incomplete or unavailable to establish that even the largest of highway projects would result in levels of risk greater than deemed acceptable. Because of the limitations in the methodologies for forecasting health impacts described, any predicted difference in health impacts between alternatives is likely to be much smaller than the uncertainties 21 Mobile-Source Air Toxics: A Critical Review of the Literature on Exposure and Health Effects (HEI, 2007).

Consequently, the results of such assessments would not be useful to decision makers, who would need to weigh this information against project benefits, such as reducing traffic congestion, accident rates, and fatalities, plus improved access for emergency response, that are better suited for quantitative analysis. Exposure to MSATs Because the estimated VMT under each of the Build Alternatives is nearly the same, it is expected that there would be no appreciable difference in overall MSATs emissions among the Build Alternatives. For all alternatives, emissions are virtually certain to be lower than present levels in the design year as a result of USEPA's national control programs that are projected to reduce annual MSATs emissions by over 80 percent from 2010 to 2050. Local conditions may differ from these national projections in terms of fleet mix and turnover, VMT growth rates, and local control measures. However, the magnitude of the USEPA-projected reductions is so great (even after accounting for VMT growth) that MSATs emissions in the study area are likely to be lower in the future than they are today. 5.8.2 Existing Conditions As shown in Figure 3.1-1 in Chapter 3: Transportation Analysis, based on 2009 data, existing US 53 has AADTs ranging from approximately 12,000 from north and south of Virginia to 22,400 in the existing easement agreement area. These traffic volumes are substantially below the benchmark criterion of 79,400 described above. Signalized intersections are located on either side of the existing easement agreement area at 12th Avenue in Virginia and Progress Park Parkway/Grant Avenue in Eveleth. Co. 7, the north-south route segment of the proposed No Build Alternative, presently has AADTs ranging from 2,000 to 5,700 across its study area corridor. The highest AADT segment of the No Build Alternative is the portion of US 169 between Co. 7 and US 53, which has an AADT of 15,800. The Co. 7 at-grade intersection with Co. 101 is controlled by a stop sign, and the Co. 7 intersection with US 169 is signalized. The Co. 101 connection between US 53 and Co. 7 runs through Eveleth, where there is an AADT of approximately 5,700. 5.8.3 Environmental Consequences The No Build, M-1, E-1A, and E-2 Alternatives (and their respective options) would not result in an increase in traffic volumes, vehicle mix, basic project location, or any other factor that would cause an increase in MSATs impacts compared to the Existing US 53 Alternative (existing condition). This project has been determined to generate negligible air quality impacts for Clean Air Act Amendments criteria pollutants and has not been linked with any special MSATs concerns as compared to existing conditions. Moreover, USEPA regulations for vehicle engines and fuels will cause overall MSATs emissions to decline significantly over the next several decades. Based on regulations now in effect, an analysis of national trends with USEPA's MOVES2010b model forecasts a combined reduction of 83 percent in the total annual emission rate for the priority MSATs from 2010 to 2050 while vehicle-miles traveled are projected to increase by 102 percent. This will reduce both the background level of MSATs as well as the possibility of even minor future MSATs emissions. Future AADTs for the project do not approach the benchmark criterion for a carbon monoxide hot spot air quality analysis described above in Section 5.8.1.1. The location with the highest estimated 2037 AADT is within the No Build Alternative study area at US 169, where the AADT estimate is 45,700 (Figure 3.1-2). The project is not located in an area in which conformity requirements apply, and the scope of the project does not indicate that air quality impacts would be expected. Therefore, no further air quality analysis is necessary. 5.8.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures No transportation-related air quality impacts have been identified for any alternative; therefore, no mitigation is proposed. 5.9 Vegetation and Cover Types 5.9.1 Methodology The study area for vegetation for each alternative included the area within and directly adjacent to the project alternatives. Potential impacts were based on the areas of evaluation as defined at the beginning of this chapter, in Chapter 2: Alternatives, and shown in Figures 2.1-5, 2.1-6, and 2.2-1. As previously described, the widened area of evaluation over the Rouchleau Pit was determined to have similar vegetation impacts regardless of where the ultimate road alignment is placed within the widened area. This conclusion was based on the consistent coverage of trees throughout the widened area above the pit (see Figure 5.4-1), which cannot be avoided by any road alignment. Refinements to the preferred alternative layout will evaluate ways to reduce vegetation impacts, which will be reported in the Final EIS. 5.9.2 Existing Conditions Six cover types occur within the study area and are described below: ■ Wetlands Several different wetland types are present within the project study area, the majority of which were previously disturbed by mining activities. The wetland types include sedge meadows, shallow marshes, and seasonally flooded basins. The sedge meadows contained dogwood (sapling), willow (sapling), river bulrush, sedges, wool grass, blue vervain, and other herbaceous species. Shallow marshes had cattails, river bulrush, soft stem bulrush, wool grass, arrowhead, and burr reed along with other emergent vegetation. The seasonally flooded basins contained numerous different species including speckled alder, aspen, Canada blue-joint grass, sedges, vervain, and jewelweed. ■ Wooded/Forest The wooded/forest areas consisted primarily of successional forest that had been previously disturbed by mining activities. No rare/unique vegetation is present. Species found within canopy layer of the wooded/forest areas were aspen, birch, and pine, with an average diameter at breast height (dbh) of less than eight inches. The understory vegetation was comprised of speckled alder and aspen saplings. The wooded/forest areas had very little herbaceous vegetation as a result of the thick aspen, birch, and pine canopy. ■ Shrub/Grassland The shrub and grassland areas were located in areas that were previously disturbed by mining activities. These areas consisted of aspen, dogwood, and willow saplings with bluegrass, tansy, yarrow, hawkweed, raspberry, and goldenrod. Other notable species include prairie rose, loosestrife, and hawks beard. ■ Vegetated Disturbed Areas categorized as vegetated disturbed include roadway right-of-way, areas adjacent to trails, access roads, and other areas that were recently disturbed but supported vegetation. The dominant species in these areas included dandelions, ragweed, hawkweed, tansy, yarrow, bluegrass, and other vegetation common to highly disturbed areas. These areas are mowed regularly. ■ Unvegetated Disturbed Unvegetated disturbed areas include the mine cliffs for the Rouchleau Pit, the Auburn Pit, and the access roads and trails near the Rouchleau Pit and on adjacent state property. ■ Urban The urban areas include areas within the city of Virginia that are characterized by residential, commercial, or industrial land uses. The urban areas are manicured or have landscaped areas, along with buildings, sidewalks, driveways, and other components found within residential, commercial, or industrial land uses. Vegetation and cover types were estimated by using aerial photography interpretation and field review during a site visit in June 2012. The estimated acreages of the different identified cover types were calculated for before construction (existing conditions) and after construction of the proposed roadway. The area within the study area would be converted to either impervious surface or vegetated disturbed, such as roadway right-of-way and vegetated medians, where applicable. 5.9.3 Environmental Consequences The acreages of cover types present within the areas of evaluation for the No Build, M-1, E-1A, and E-2 Alternatives are shown in Table 5.9-1. The Existing US 53 Alternative only impacts the existing US 53 easement agreement area and therefore was not included in the table. The cover type impact areas are based on the areas of evaluation as defined at the beginning of this chapter and shown in Figures 2.1-5, 2.1-6, and 2.2-1. Cover types do not differ between the Alternative E-1A RSS Option and Bridge Option. For Alternative E-2, the Straight Option is shown in Table 5.9-1. The Curved Setback Option would impact approximately an additional 10 acres of wooded/forest area, two acres of wetland, and six acres of shrub/grassland. Table 5.9-1.

B For Alternatives E-1A and E-2, the acres after construction were calculated based on representative corridors averaging 200-400 feet wide and 150-300 feet wide, respectively. 5.9.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures Efforts have been made during alternatives development and preliminary engineering of the various alternatives to minimize vegetation removal to the extent possible by following previously disturbed areas (roads, mined lands). Mitigation for wetland impacts is addressed in Section 5.4 of this document and stormwater ponding requirements are addressed in Section 5.5. Due to the previously disturbed nature of much of the area, no special/unique mitigation is specifically required for the remaining cover type changes. Standard practices for weeds and invasive species would be implemented. 5.10 Fish and Wildlife 5.10.1 Regulatory Context and Methodology 5.10.1.1 Regulatory Context The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 (16 USC 703-712) governs the taking, killing, possession, transportation, and importation of migratory birds including eggs, parts, and nests. Such actions are prohibited unless authorized under a valid permit. This law applies to migratory birds native to the United States and its territories. It does not apply to non-native migratory birds or resident species that do not migrate on a seasonal basis. In general, aquatic habitat identified in the Public Waters Inventory is protected by the DNR through the Public Waters Work Permit. The DNR Public Waters Work Permit and Utility Crossing License ensure that bridge construction or reconstruction is not detrimental to significant fish and wildlife habitat, including measures to protect against obstructing the movement of game fish, disrupting fish spawning, or other practical measures to mitigate effects. Minnesota statutes also provide for the conservation of habitats by controlling weeds (Minnesota Noxious Weed Law 18.376-18.88). 5.10.1.2 Methodology The areas of evaluation, as described at the beginning of this chapter, were used as the study areas for fish and wildlife. Wildlife associations were determined by reviewing the cover types (Section 5.9) and the type of wildlife that use those cover types for habitat.26 The following definitions were used to describe the severity of potential impacts and consider the diversity/integrity of the resource and the relative extent of the impact area: ■ Negligible impacts are those that are imperceptible or not detectable. The action would not result in noticeable changes in habitat or wildlife use. ■ Minor impacts are those that are slightly detectable and localized but would not affect the overall viability of the wildlife within that area. It is anticipated that wildlife within areas identified as having minor impacts would adapt to habitat changes and/or use adjacent habitat areas. ■ Moderate impacts affect an area that is sufficient to cause a perceptible change in wildlife abundance or distribution or habitat quality or quantity, but the change would remain localized. ■ Major impacts are those that are substantial, highly noticeable, and permanently impact the overall amount of habitat within the study area. It is anticipated that wildlife within areas with major impacts would not adapt due to a lack of availability of adjacent habitat. A DNR review of its records for known rare wildlife features was requested. Rare features include the following: ■ Native plant communities: Native plant communities are groups of native plants that interact with each other and with their environment in ways not greatly altered by modern human activity over space and time. Although most native plant communities have no legal protection in Minnesota, the Natural Heritage and Nongame Research Program and the Minnesota County Biological Survey have evaluated and ranked community types according to their rarity and endangerment through their range. ■ Animal aggregations: Animal aggregations are tracked regardless of the legal status of the species that comprise them. The tendency to aggregate makes these species vulnerable because a single catastrophic event could result in the loss of many individuals. 26 According to Northwoods Wildlife (Benyus, 1989) Peregrine falcons were identified within the project area during the DNR database record search, with nesting reports in 1991 and 1992 on the pit wall at the north end of the Rouchleau Pit. No sightings have been recorded since that time. The peregrine falcon population has recovered since that time and, as a result, was federally delisted in 1996 and has since been downgraded from threatened to special concern in Minnesota. However, it is still protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. 5.10.2 Existing Conditions Wildlife around and within the study area are associated with open waterbodies, wetlands, woodlands, right-of-way grassland, previously disturbed shrub-meadows, rural-urban landscaping, and unvegetated disturbed areas such as the operational mine and mine pits. Table 5.10-1. Wildlife Associations for Habitat Types Found Within the Study Area Habitat (Cover Type)  Quality  Wildlife  Wetlands  Medium/Low  American bittern, red-winged black bird, herons, small mammals such as mink, muskrat, song birds, harrier, frogs, snakes, turtles, deer, and moose  Wooded Forest  Medium  Grouse, song birds, woodpeckers, fox, raccoon, squirrels, snakes, bats, salamanders, owls, hawks, and wolves  Shrub/Grassland  Medium  Song birds (e.g., swallows), fox, woodchucks, red-tailed hawk, American kestrel, voles, mice, ground squirrels, weasels, snakes, and deer  Vegetated (Disturbed)  Low  Songbirds, hawks, fox, deer, mice, squirrels, snakes, and other small mammals  Unvegetated (Disturbed)  Low  Active mine pit is not considered habitat due to absence of vegetation  Open Water (Rouchleau Pit)  Low  Pit depth not expected to provide preferred habitat for water birds or fowl. Peregrines and other cliff dwellers (e.g., swallows) may use pit walls, but limited for most due to steepness.  Urban  Low  Songbirds, hawks, fox, deer, mice, raccoon, squirrels, snakes, and other small mammals  5.10.3 Environmental Consequences 5.10.3.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) The No Build Alternative does not involve any new construction; therefore, there would be no impact to wildlife habitat. 5.10.3.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) No improvements are proposed for the Existing US 53 Alternative. Therefore, there would be no impact to wildlife habitat. 5.10.3.3 Alternative M-1 Some wildlife impacts are anticipated to occur with this alternative; however, with the majority of the corridor located within the Auburn Pit (an area previously/actively disturbed by mining activities), impacts to wildlife would be negligible to minor. The wildlife that inhabit the areas adjacent to the pit are generalist species that are adapted to disturbed areas. These species are generally more tolerant of human presence and activities, including traffic and mining operations (blasting, earthwork, etc.), and have demonstrated by their presence that they adapt readily to anthropogenic changes in their environment. Due to the disturbed nature of the area and the availability of low quality habitat within the Alternative M-1 alignment, the impact to wildlife habitat would be negligible to minor. No rare features or species were identified in the DNR database search for this alternative. Therefore, no impacts to rare features would occur as a result of Alternative M-1. 5.10.3.4 Alternative E-1A Some wildlife impacts are anticipated to occur as a result of this alternative. Due to the disturbed nature of the habitat (area previously disturbed from mining activities), the wildlife species that inhabit these areas are generalist species adapted to highly disturbed habitat and anthropogenic disruptions, such as adjacent mining operations and traffic and transit activities. These species have demonstrated by their presence that they adapt readily to anthropogenic changes in their environment. A negligible to minor impact to wildlife would occur as a result of either the Alternative E-1A RSS Option or Bridge Option, with either the Intersection Option or Interchange Option. The impact is small compared to the large amount of adjacent habitat available to the east and north of this alternative. Peregrine falcons were identified within the project area during the DNR database record search, with nesting reports in 1991 and 1992 on the pit wall at the north end of the Rouchleau Pit. No sightings have been recorded since that time. The peregrine falcon population has recovered since that time and, as a result, was federally delisted in 1996 and has since been downgraded from threatened to special concern in Minnesota. However, it is still protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. If peregrine falcons are observed during construction, the MnDOT biologist will be contacted for coordination with the DNR Non-Game Program. No other rare features or species were identified during the database search. 5.10.3.5 Alternative E-2 Some wildlife impacts are anticipated to occur as a result of this alternative. Due to the disturbed nature of the habitat (area previously disturbed from mining activities), the wildlife species that inhabit these areas are generalist species adapted to highly disturbed habitat and anthropogenic disruptions, such as adjacent mining operations and traffic and transit activities. These species have demonstrated by their presence that they adapt readily to anthropogenic changes in their environment. A negligible to minor impact to wildlife would occur as a result of either the Alternative E-2 Straight Option or Curved Setback Option, with either the Intersection Option or Interchange Option. The impact is small compared to the large amount of adjacent habitat available to the east and north of this alternative. Peregrine falcons were identified within the project area during the DNR database record search, with nesting reports in 1991 and 1992 on the pit wall at the north end of the Rouchleau Pit. No sightings have been recorded since that time. The peregrine falcon population has recovered since that time and, as a result, was federally delisted in 1996 and has since been downgraded from threatened to special concern in Minnesota. However, it is still protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. If peregrine falcons are observed during construction, the MnDOT biologist will be contacted for coordination with the DNR Non-Game Program. No other rare features or species were identified during the database search. 5.10.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures Efforts have been made during alternatives development and preliminary engineering of the various alternatives to minimize vegetation (habitat) removal to the extent possible by following previously disturbed areas (roads, mined lands). Wildlife habitat impacts will be minimized to the extent possible during further design stages of the project. During the early stages of design refinement for the preferred alternative, bridge structures and the Rouchleau Pit cliffs within the potential construction limits would be field checked in compliance with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to determine whether swallows or peregrine falcon nesting sites are present. If active swallow or peregrine nests are documented, appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented during construction, such as seasonal work windows or nest removal/netting during the non-nesting season. The measures selected for construction mitigation would be made in consultation with the appropriate agencies. 5.11 Threatened and Endangered Species 5.11.1 Regulatory Context and Methodology 5.11.1.1 Regulatory Context Federally Listed Species/Designated Critical Habitat Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, as amended, requires each federal agency to review any action that it funds, authorizes, or carries out to determine whether it may affect threatened, endangered, or proposed species or listed critical habitat. Federal agencies (or their designated representatives) must consult with the USFWS if any such effects may occur as a result of their actions. Consultation with the USFWS is not necessary if the proposed action will not directly or indirectly affect listed species or critical habitat. If a federal agency finds that an action will have no effect on listed species or critical habitat, it should maintain a written record or that finding that includes the supporting rationale. Species Proposed for Listing Section 7(a)(4) requires federal agencies to confer with the USFWS on any agency action that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any species proposed for listing or result in the adverse modification of critical habitat proposed to be designated. A conference may involve informal discussions between the USFWS, the action agency, and the applicant. Following informal conference, the USFWS issues a conference report containing recommendations for reducing adverse effects. These recommendations are discretionary because an agency is not prohibited from jeopardizing the continued existence of a proposed species or from adversely modifying proposed critical habitat. However, as soon as a listing action is finalized, the prohibition against jeopardy or adverse modification applies, regardless of the stage of the action. State Species Minnesota’s endangered species law (Minnesota Statutes, section 84.0895) and associated rules (Minnesota Rules, part 6212.1800-6212.2300) regulate the taking, importation, transportation, and sale of state endangered or threatened species. The DNR administers the state listed rare, threatened, and endangered species. 5.11.1.2 Methodology The DNR Natural Heritage Information System (NHIS) Database was used to identify potential federal and state listed species within one mile of the project alternatives. The NHIS database comprises locational records of known listed species as well as other rare plants, rare animals, and other rare features including native plant communities, geologic features, and animal aggregations (such as nesting colonies). A bat survey was also conducted for the project area by the DNR to determine the potential presence of northern long-eared bats. The results of the survey are in the process of being evaluated. 5.11.2 Existing Conditions Federally Listed Species/Designated Critical Habitat in the Project Area According to the official County Distribution of Minnesota’s Federally Listed Threatened, Endangered, Proposed, and Candidate Species List (revised April 30, 2014) maintained by the USFWS, St. Louis County is within the distribution range of the species listed in Table 5.11-1. Table 5.11-1. Species with Distribution Ranges in St. Louis County Species  Status  Habitat  Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) Great Lakes Breeding Population  Endangered and Critical Habitat Designated  Sandy beaches, islands  Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis)  Threatened  Northern forest  Critical Habitat  See Figure 5.11-1  Rufa Red Knot (Calidris canutus rufa)  Proposed Threatened  Coastal areas along Lake Superior  Northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis)  Proposed as Endangered  Hibernates in caves and mines (called hibernacula), swarming at entrances of hibernacula in autumn; roosts and forages in upland forests during spring and summer  MnDOT has been in close coordination with the USFWS in regards to both the selection of the appropriate consultation path as well as the level of analysis needed. The following is a breakdown of the determinations made for each species. ■ Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus): There are no known occurrence records of piping plover in the general vicinity of the proposed project. Based on the location and lack of suitable nesting habitat, it has been determined that this project will have no effect on this species. ■ Canada Lynx (Lynx canadensis): According to the USFWS, there are documented occurrences of the Canada lynx within 10 miles of the project area and designated critical habitat for this species within five miles. The USFWS concluded that while construction related impacts are expected to occur, they are all within disturbed areas outside of critical habitat where the lynx is less likely to occur. Given that the original highway is being removed and the new highway segment will maintain the same speed limit and remain outside of critical habitat, the USFWS does not feel that there is an increased risk to the lynx. The USFWS concurred with the determination that the project may affect but is not likely to adversely affect the Canada lynx (see Appendix C). Proposed Federal Species in the Project Area ■ Rufa Red Knot (Calidris canutus rufa): There are no known occurrence records of the rufa red knot in the general vicinity of the proposed project. Based on the location and lack of suitable nesting habitat, it has been determined that this project will have no effect on this species. ■ Northern Long-Eared Bat (Myotis septentrionalis): As indicated in the October 2, 2013 Federal Register, the northern long-eared bat is currently proposed for listing as an endangered species in all 87 Minnesota counties. The USFWS is currently working on developing consultation guidance for lead federal agencies to use in making determinations of effect for this species. Until this guidance is distributed and the species officially listed, the lead federal agency must assess the potential for jeopardy. In order to accurately assess the potential for project related impacts to this species, MnDOT is working with the USFWS and the DNR. Field investigations were conducted in the summer/fall of 2014 and review of findings is underway. The DNR report is not yet finalized; however, discussion with DNR staff indicates that the northern long-eared bat echolocation calls27 were recorded at each sampling station in the study area (see Figure 5.11-2). The DNR study also identified a mine void in the study area that could be a potential bat hibernaculum (see Figure 5.11-3 for approximate cave location). A copy of correspondence between MnDOT OES and the DNR is included in Appendix C. The information gathered is informing the assessment of the potential for jeopardy/effect. Updated results of studies and on-going coordination will be included in the Final EIS. State Species No state listed rare, threatened, or endangered species were identified within the study area. The use of the Rouchleau Pit by the peregrine falcon, a special concern species, has been evaluated within Section 5.10. Figure 5.11-1. Critical Habitat for Lynx canadensis as Identified within the Recovery Plan 27 Echolocation is the biological sonar used by several kinds of animals, including bats, for navigation and foraging/hunting. Echolocating animals emit calls out to the environment and listen to the echoes of those calls to locate and identify the objects. The northern long-eared bat’s echolocation call distinguishes it from other bat species. 5.11.3 Environmental Consequences 5.11.3.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) The No Build reroute is west of the critical habitat for the Canada lynx, and the alignment remains within existing right-of-way; therefore, no adverse impacts to the Canada lynx are anticipated. No state listed rare, threatened, or endangered species were identified by DNR in the study area. 5.11.3.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) No improvements are proposed for the Existing US 53 Alternative. Therefore, no impacts are anticipated to occur to federal or state rare, threatened, or endangered species. 5.11.3.3 Alternative M-1 The Alternative M-1 alignment is west of critical habitat for the Canada lynx and on the opposite side of US 53. The Alternative M-1 study area is highly disturbed, and the majority of the area is within the existing Auburn Pit. No adverse impacts to the Canada lynx are anticipated. MnDOT is coordinating with the USFWS and DNR to assess the potential for impacts to the northern long-eared bat, proposed for listing as an endangered species. Based on current information, the impacts of this alternative are not anticipated to jeopardize the continued existence of the species. As noted in Table 5.11-1, the northern long-eared bat roosts and forages in upland forests during spring and summer. Alternative M-1 results in eight acres of forest habitat impact and, therefore, could potentially affect forest used as summer roosting areas by the northern long-eared bat. This bat also hibernates in caves and mines. The identified cave/potential hibernaculum is not located in the Alternative M-1 area of evaluation. No state listed rare, threatened, or endangered species were identified by the DNR in the study area. 5.11.3.4 Alternative E-1A The critical habitat for the Canada lynx is not within the study area for Alternative E-1A (includes the RSS, Bridge, Intersection, and Interchange Options). Due to the disturbed nature of the study area and the lack of boreal forests, no adverse impacts to the Canada lynx are anticipated. MnDOT is coordinating with the USFWS and DNR to assess the potential for impacts to the northern long-eared bat, proposed for listing as an endangered species. Based on current information, the impacts of this alternative are not anticipated to jeopardize the continued existence of the species. Alternative E-1A results in the following impacts to forest habitat that could potentially affect forest used as summer roosting areas by the northern long-eared bat: ■ Alternative E-1 A (RSS Option or Bridge Option) Intersection Option: 28 acres ■ Alternative E-1 A (RSS Option or Bridge Option) Interchange Option: 33 acres The identified potential hibernaculum is not located in the Alternative E-1A area of evaluation (see Figure 5.11-3). No state listed rare, threatened, or endangered species were identified by the DNR in the study area. 5.11.3.5 Alternative E-2 The critical habitat for the Canada lynx is not within the study area for Alternative E-2 (includes the Straight, Curved Setback, Intersection, and Interchange Options). Due to the disturbed nature of the study area and the lack of boreal forests, no adverse impacts to the Canada lynx are anticipated. MnDOT is coordinating with the USFWS and DNR to assess the potential for impacts to the northern long-eared bat, proposed for listing as an endangered species. Based on current information, the impacts of this alternative are not anticipated to jeopardize the continued existence of the species. Alternative E-2 results in the following impacts to forest habitat that could potentially affect forest used as summer roosting areas by the northern long-eared bat: ■ Alternative E-2 Straight Option Intersection Option: 33 acres ■ Alternative E-2 Straight Option Interchange Option: 37 acres ■ Alternative E-2 Curved Setback Option Intersection Option: 43 acres ■ Alternative E-2 Curved Setback Option Interchange Option: 47 acres The identified potential hibernaculum is not located in the Alternative E-2 area of evaluation. No state listed rare, threatened, or endangered species were identified by the DNR in the study area. 5.11.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures Efforts have been made during alternatives development and preliminary engineering of the various alternatives to minimize vegetation (habitat) removal to the extent possible by following previously disturbed areas (roads, mined lands). MnDOT OES has entered into informal consultation with USFWS for the Canada lynx as part of the Section 7 process. MnDOT does not anticipate any project modification as a result of the consultation process. A copy of the correspondence between MNDOT OES and USFWS is included in Appendix C. In addition, MnDOT is continuing to work with the USFWS to develop avoidance measures where possible and minimize or mitigate unavoidable project related impacts to the northern long-eared bat (proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act). MnDOT will include relevant completed Section 7 consultation/coordination documentation in the Final EIS. 5.12 Hazardous Materials and Contaminated Properties This section of the Draft EIS is derived from the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) (October 2013), the Phase II Investigation Results (November 2013), and the Subsurface Taconite Assessment and Drilling Report (August 2012), incorporated herein by reference and available on the project website.28 5.12.1 Regulatory Context and Methodology 5.12.1.1 Regulatory Context The MPCA oversees regulations pertaining to contaminated soil, groundwater, and waste cleanup plan approvals; petroleum underground storage tank registration and removal; and NPDES permitting. Activities that encounter contaminated materials must follow state requirements for safe handling and disposal under the purview of the MPCA. MDH oversees the safe handling and disposal of materials that may cause harm to individuals directly exposed, such as asbestos. 5.12.1.2 Methodology Potentially Contaminated Sites A Phase I ESA was conducted for this Draft EIS in October 2011 to identify any potential sources of contamination that could impact the study area. This Phase I ESA was revised in October of 2013 to update and append the 2011 findings. The assessments were carried out in accordance with the requirements of the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) E 1527-05 “Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process.” The study area for both reports for potentially contaminated sites included all properties within or adjacent to a 500-foot radius of the alignments for each proposed alternative and within the appropriate ASTM standard search distances for available governmental databases (E1527-05 and 40 CFR 312). These standard search distances vary in size, from adjacent to a proposed alignment to over one mile around an alignment (½ mile on each side). The database search was conducted for each Build Alternative. For purposes of this document, impacts (potential for contamination) were defined as any sites identified in the Phase I report that are located within the areas of evaluation as shown in Figure 5.12-1. 28 http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/TechnicalReports.html In addition, the area of evaluation for the No Build Alternative is the existing right-of-way for the designated reroute roadways (MN 37, Co. 7, US 169). No improvements outside of these existing right-ofway areas are anticipated. The Phase I ESA included ranking/classification of all identified sites within the project area as having a high, medium, or low potential for the presence of contamination and justification of these rankings/classifications. These rankings are based on current and past uses of the site and on the use, storage, and/or release of hazardous substances or petroleum products at the site. Rankings are based solely on the sites’ potential for the presence of contamination and not on the sites’ locations with respect to the area of evaluation. ■ Low Risk: Low risk sites are locations where hazardous material or petroleum products may have been stored or used. However, based on subsequent file review and field reconnaissance, no known contamination is associated with the property. Low risk sites include large quantity generators and small to minimal quantity generators. ■ Medium Risk: These sites are known to have, or have had, soil and/or groundwater contamination, but current information indicates that contamination is being remediated, does not require remediation, or already requires continued monitoring. Medium risk sites include all closed leak sites and tank sites. ■ High Risk: These sites have a high potential for contamination. In some cases, contaminated groundwater may have migrated outside the boundaries of the site. Field investigation of soil and groundwater within planned construction limits may be needed to identify any contributing contamination from these sites and to identify a response action plan to be implemented during construction. High risk sites include all active and inactive Voluntary Investigation and Cleanup (VIC) sites, state and federal Superfund sites, all active leaking underground storage tanks (LUST) sites, unpermitted dump sites, and petroleum brownfield sites. A Phase II ESA was conducted for the Draft EIS in November 2013 to evaluate subsurface conditions of the sites within the areas of evaluation for Alternatives E-1A and E-2, which were considered to have the highest potential for contamination that could impact proposed construction. The Phase II Investigation locations were selected based on specific areas or properties of potential environmental concern that were noted during the 2013 Phase I ESA for these alignments. In general, investigation locations were selected at parcels/properties classified as having Medium Potential for Contamination or High Potential for Contamination in the 2013 Phase I ESA. The investigation included completion of soil borings B-1 through B-28 (locations shown in Appendix I) between September 23, 2013 and September 26, 2013 using a hydraulically-driven direct-push rig. The total soil boring depths ranged from 7.5 feet to 20 feet below ground surface (bgs). The Phase II ESA also included completion of test trenches T-1 through T-12 on September 24 and 25, 2013. All of the test trenches were completed in Parcel 17 (owned by RGGS). A track-mounted backhoe was used to complete the test trenches. The total test trench depths were 10 feet bgs, except for T-2, which encountered bedrock at two feet bgs. One surface soil sample (Surface Sample-1) was also collected on Parcel 17 to assess a small area where suspected copper wire salvaging activities had occurred. Soil samples were collected continuously from each soil boring at two-foot intervals. Similarly, soil samples were collected continuously in each test trench as the hole was exposed. The soil samples were examined for evidence of potential contamination, including odors, staining, or debris, and were screened with a photoionization detector (PID) equipped with a 10.6 electron volt (eV) lamp. Soil samples collected from the test trenches were submitted to Pace Analytical Services of Virginia, Minnesota for analytical testing. The soil samples were analyzed for a combination of the following parameters: ■ Diesel range organics (DRO) ■ Gasoline range organics (GRO) ■ Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) ■ Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) metals ■ Semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) Soil sample Surface Sample-1 was analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and RCRA metals. Roadbed Drilling Investigation MnDOT performed a Subsurface Taconite Assessment (August 2012) within the existing US 53 corridor. The purpose of the assessment was to evaluate the possible presence of taconite tailings that may have been incorporated into the US 53 road base during construction within the existing US 53 easement agreement area and whether or not these tailings contain asbestos (a regulated material). The investigation included twenty soil borings (locations shown in Appendix I) placed every 0.1 mile along the current alignment and advanced to a depth of five feet. These results were then used to estimate the total cubic yards of taconite tailings within the study area. Nine bulk taconite samples were analyzed with polarized light microscopy (PLM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to determine the presence or lack thereof of asbestos. The PLM laboratory method is used to establish the regulated levels. Regulated levels are defined as materials containing over one percent asbestos using this PLM methodology. In addition to the regulatory-level analysis using PLM, MnDOT also analyzed the samples using the TEM method, which can detect minute levels of asbestos or asbestos-like fibers. Asbestos-like fibers are unregulated materials and have no known regulatory threshold. MnDOT also reviewed historical construction records to determine the potential for existence of tailings or fill from mining areas from the east range of the Biwabik Iron Formation present in the road base. MnDOT was unable to find evidence of tailings or fill relocated from the east range of the Biwabik Iron Formation to this area. Coordination with St. Louis County has been made to determine if any records exist that identify if tailings were used under Landfill Road, and no records were located. 5.12.2 Existing Conditions The Subsurface Taconite Assessment and Drilling Investigation (August 2012) estimated that a small amount (23,350 cubic yards) of taconite tailings are present within the existing US 53 right-of-way between the west side of 6th Avenue and 2nd Avenue, which falls within area of evaluation for the No Build Alternative and all Build Alternatives. No asbestos containing materials were detected using the PLM laboratory method. Using the TEM method, very low (0.0016% and 0.0006%) detections of asbestos-like materials were indicated in two of the nine taconite samples (near 6th Avenue). 5.12.2.1 No Build (Easement Agreement Area Closed) No potentially contaminated sites were identified within the area of the No Build Alternative. 5.12.2.2 Existing US 53 Alternatives (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) No potentially contaminated sites were identified in the area of the Existing US 53 Alternative. 5.12.2.3 Alternative M-1 A total of 17 potentially contaminated sites were identified by the Phase I ESA study area that are at least partially located within the Alternative M-1 area of evaluation, as shown in Figure 5.12-1 and listed in Table 5.12-1. 5.12.2.4 Alternative E-1A A total of 16 potentially contaminated sites were identified within the Phase I ESA study area that are at least partially located within the Alternative E-1A area of evaluation (including the RSS, Bridge, Intersection, and Interchange Options), as shown in Figure 5.12-1 and listed in Table 5.12-2. Within the Rouchleau Pit, the submerged haul road embankment that the Alternative E-1A alignment follows was constructed with waste material from within the pit. No asbestos containing materials have been detected within the Rouchleau Pit. 5.12.2.5 Alternative E-2 A total of nine potentially contaminated sites were identified within the Phase I ESA study area that are at least partially located within the Alternative E-2 area of evaluation (including the Straight, Curved Setback, Intersection, and Interchange Options), as shown in Figure 5.12-1 and listed in Table 5.12-3. 5.12.3 Environmental Consequences As described above, taconite tailings are present in the existing roadbed in small amounts; however, recent analytical results indicate that the taconite does not contain asbestos. The asbestos-like fibers detected are not regulated and were detected at negligible levels (considerably less than one percent). Therefore, no impacts related to asbestos-containing materials are expected from any alternative. 5.12.3.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) Due to the nature of the No Build Alternative, no disturbance would take place; therefore, no hazardous sites would be encountered during construction activities. 5.12.3.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) No disturbance would take place under the Existing US 53 Alternative. This alternative would acquire the existing easement agreement area for permanent right-of-way; however, the Phase II ESA investigation did not find any potentially contaminated sites within the existing easement agreement area. 5.12.3.3 Alternative M-1 Seventeen of the sites identified in the Phase I ESA (Table 5.12-1) are located within the area of evaluation for Alternative M-1, including three high risk, four medium risk, and 10 low risk sites.

Three sites were recommended for further investigation or consideration by MnDOT due to the following reasons: ■ Vacant Industrial Facility (former Staver Foundry) ■ Petroleum release with “open” status according to MPCA ■ Elevated concentrations of arsenic, lead, Benzo (a)pyrene (BaP) and DRO detected in soil samples ■ Lenci Enterprises, Inc. & Sunrise Equipment Corp ■ Elevated concentrations of DRO and BaP detected in soil samples ■ Recently closed petroleum release ■ Bike Path and Wenonah Properties (RGGS) ■ Elevated levels of arsenic in a former copper wire salvaging area ■ Man-made debris present ■ Past use as mining facility Construction activities on these sites would need to consider the potential for encountering contaminated soil and appropriate avoidance and minimization measures (see below). 5.12.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures Taconite Materials Handling MnDOT’s Standard Specification for Construction Manual (MnDOT, 2005) allows taconite tailings from certain areas to be used in bituminous mixtures and as road base. Historically, starting in the 1950s, MnDOT constructed some roadways in northern Minnesota using taconite tailings for aggregate in road base and bituminous. Reconstruction of these roadways requires excavation and handling of taconite tailings. Certain aggregates in the east range of the Biwabik Iron Formation contain minerals that generally resemble asbestos (asbestos-like materials), which are not subject to asbestos regulations. MnDOT has produced a best practice for management of tailings used in highway construction,29 recognizing that even though taconite tailings present in this project are not subject to regulation, some reasonable handling techniques are prudent. MnDOT will use its standard regulated materials BMP procedures during construction on this project to limit potential exposure from taconite to the public and to the contractors and employees working on this project. This BMP guidance is included in Appendix I. MnDOT will specify in construction documents that all aggregate materials to be used for project construction will be from sources that are free from asbestos or other contaminants. The University of Minnesota is conducting a Minnesota Taconite Workers Health Study.30 This study is taking a comprehensive look at the health of Minnesota taconite workers from the east and west portions of the Mesabi Iron Range. Any available and relevant information from this study regarding potential risks and/or recommended handling of taconite tailings will be reported in the Final EIS. Potentially Contaminated Sites A Response Action Plan (RAP) will be completed, as necessary, for the selected alternative prior to any right-of-way acquisition or construction by MnDOT. A RAP would set a protocol for properly handling and treating contaminated soil and/or groundwater that could be handled during construction as identified in the contract special provisions or the RAP. If necessary, MnDOT may enroll in the MPCA Voluntary Investigation and Cleanup (VIC) Program to obtain regulatory assurances for contamination indicated during Phase II investigations and to obtain approvals for any contamination management and clean-up plans. If necessary, prior to construction activities a MPCA-approved Construction Contingency Plan and/or contract special provision will be developed. In the event that previously unknown hazardous materials are discovered during construction, the Contractor shall notify the Project Engineer immediately and follow the prescribed management protocol contained in the Construction Contingency Plan/RAP or contract special provisions. The materials would be handled in accordance with all appropriate federal, state, and local regulations. During construction, there is potential for incidental spills of vehicle fluids and/or fuels as a result of normal existing roadway operations or traffic incidents. In the event that any spill is encountered within the project area, the appropriate response protocol required by the MnDOT Technical Memorandum No. 11-10-M-02 would be followed. 29 MnDOT Regulated Materials Management Section 11, MnDOT Office of Environmental Stewardship, Environmental Investigation Unit, Best Management Practice, Taconite Tailings Road Aggregate 30 Minnesota Taconite Workers Health Study website: http://taconiteworkers.umn.edu/index.html Spills Any potential contaminant spills on the road, such as gasoline, oil, and antifreeze, would be collected within the storm sewer system on the road and conveyed to a treatment pond on the west side of the pit where they could be contained for cleanup; therefore, no contaminants would be directly discharged into the pit. Emergency spills would be cleaned up as identified in MnDOT’s Emergency Spill Response Technical Memorandum (MnDOT, April 2011). 5.13 Excess Material 5.13.1 Disposal of Excess Materials This section covers the general material needs for the project by alternative, noting whether there is expected to be excess material and, if so, the potential for off-site disposal to affect known environmentally sensitive sites near the project. Excess material can be taken off site by the contractor for reuse on other projects, with the exception of taconite. 5.13.2 Sensitive Resources The Quad Cities and neighboring areas have an abundance of wetlands, lakes, floodplains, and other natural or sensitive areas that are protected by law from indiscriminant filling or grading. 5.13.3 Environmental Consequences The No Build, M-1, E-1A, and E-2 Alternatives would require proper disposal or reuse of the existing roadway pavement and the top few feet of roadbed from the terminated easement agreement area from which US 53 is relocated. However, no disposal of excess materials would occur in wetlands, floodplains, or other sensitive areas. Based on preliminary calculations, Alternative M-1 and the Alternative E-1A RSS Option would require a substantial amount of granular material be imported to the project to build the roadways at the necessary elevations due to the expanse of mined area that would be crossed by each. These alternatives would not require disposal of excess material outside of their areas of evaluation. The Alternative E-2 Intersection Option requires less fill material than will be cut, so disposal of excess material outside of the area of evaluation may be required for this alternative. The amount of cut and fill material for each alternative is listed in Table 5.13-1. For Alternative M-1 and the Alternative E-1A RSS Option, which require a substantial amount of fill import, clean fill sources will be used from locally permitted and approved borrow sites. Table 5.13-1. Excess Material Generated by Alternative Alternative  Cut (cubic yards)  Fill (cubic yards)  No Build  0  0  Existing US 53  0  0  M-1  80,000  2,900,000  E-1A RSS Option  Intersection Option  3,300,000  5,000,000  Interchange Option  3,100,000  5,300,000  E-1A Bridge Option  Intersection Option  650,000  170,000  Interchange Option  625,000  370,000  E-2 Straight Option  Intersection Option  725,000  630,000  Interchange Option  700,000  850,000  E-2 Curved Setback Option  Intersection Option  700,000  700,000  Interchange Option  680,000  925,000  5.13.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures Efforts have been made during alternatives development and preliminary engineering of the various alternatives to minimize cut and fill requirements to the extent possible. Excess materials and debris from this project, such as road pavement or roadbed materials, can be taken off site by the contractor for reuse on other projects, with the exception of taconite. If excess material cannot be reused, under no circumstance will MnDOT approve creation of permit-by-rule landfills for disposal of any waste material. If disposal is required for waste materials resulting from a demolition of a road, this waste will be disposed of in a MPCA permitted demolition landfill. Demolition waste can include concrete, bituminous, untreated wood, masonry, glass, trees, and rock. If any fill is needed, specifications for the source and nature of the fill used within Virginia’s Inner Emergency Response Area (i.e., use of clean fill; use of mining by-products only if low in sulfides) would be required to avoid the potential for contamination impacts to the water supply. 5.14 Geotechnical and Earthborne Vibration 5.14.1 Methodology/Existing Conditions Section 5.6 describes the background information compiled on geology and soils in the project area. Based on this information, some potential geologic and soils issues were identified that could affect project design and construction techniques. Additional investigations were performed in key areas to provide information on the potential construction feasibility and need for special design techniques, based on issues identified for each alternative. These investigations, available on the project website,31 include: ■ Preliminary Geotechnical Engineering Report for TH 53 Relocation: M-1 Foundations (Gale-Tec Engineering, 2013) ■ Proposed TH 53 M-1 (and E-2) Alignment, Virginia, MN: Report of Seismic Study of Mine Blast Induced Vibrations (HDR, 2013) ■ Preliminary Geotechnical Engineering Report for TH 53 Relocation: E-1A Alignment – Embankment (Gale-Tec Engineering, 2014) These studies provide adequate preliminary information to allow for comparison of the alternatives under consideration in this Draft EIS. This information is described in the Environmental Consequences section below. More detailed studies related to these issues will also be conducted to inform final design and will be summarized in the Final EIS. 5.14.2 Environmental Consequences 5.14.2.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) This alternative involves no new construction or modifications; therefore, no geotechnical or earthborne vibration issues have been identified for the No Build Alternative. 31 http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/TechnicalReports.html 5.14.2.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) This alternative involves no new construction or modifications; therefore, no geotechnical or earthborne vibration issues have been identified for the Existing US 53 Alternative. 5.14.2.3 Alternative M-1 The following areas have been identified that may require special geotechnical design and/or construction techniques to address soil, embankment, and/or vibration-related issues. The existing embankment area within the Auburn Pit consists of 320 feet or more of material with a range of material sizes that was not compacted or placed to maximize structural stability when it was placed. Mine blasting activities in the vicinity could cause some further consolidation/mixing of this material, resulting in additional settlement. Three locations within the Auburn Pit embankment area have been identified as previous settling pond locations, where fine material has been deposited which could settle or create a weak area susceptible to movement from blasting vibrations in the future. Also, up to 100 feet of additional fill material may need to be added to bring the embankment up to the required grade for construction of Alternative M-1. Therefore, stability and settlement of the existing material is a potential concern; however, there are design options to address the geotechnical challenges in this situation. The area of evaluation for this alternative should be adequate for the potential design options that may be considered to achieve bank/slope stability. Mining activities would continue near the Alternative M-1 embankment at the mine, resulting in the need to construct the embankment with relatively steep slopes (to minimize the footprint of the roadway within the pit), which may require special design to maintain stability. As mining continues in the future, mine blast faces may approach the base of embankment slopes, creating potential future stability concerns. The bridge structures on the Alternative M-1 alignment would require relatively tall substructures which may be susceptible to vibrations from future blasting activities. The bridge substructures would likely need to be founded on deep foundations (piling or drilled shafts); however, the large particle sizes in the mine fill embankment would likely make pile driving and/or drilled shafts difficult, adding to project cost. 5.14.2.4 Alternative E-1A RSS Option The following areas have been identified that may require special geotechnical design and/or construction techniques to address soil, embankment, and/or vibration-related issues. The existing embankment area within the Rouchleau Pit consists of up to 100 feet or more of material with a range of material sizes that was not compacted or placed to maximize structural stability when it was placed. Mine blasting activities in the vicinity could cause some further consolidation/mixing of this material, resulting in instability or additional settlement. Also, up to 100 feet of additional fill material may need to be added to bring the embankment up to the required grade for construction of the Alternative E-1A RSS Option. Placing this fill material on top of the submerged haul road in a submerged condition would require substantial efforts to remove or stabilize existing organic material. Water levels in the Rouchleau Pit will likely vary over time due to dewatering and result in a hydraulic head differential between the east and west sides of the submerged haul road embankment. Therefore, stability and settlement of the existing fill material is potentially a greater concern than for Alternative M1; however, there are design options to address the geotechnical challenges in this situation. The area of evaluation for this alternative should be adequate for the potential design options that may be considered to achieve bank/slope stability. Future mining activity, particularly blasting, could impact the existing haul road as well as the constructed slope for the Alternative E-1A alignment. Criteria for future mining would need to be established and addressed in agreements with the mine. Depending on the depth to rock, the foundations for the future mine access bridge may need to be constructed during RSS construction. Due to the properties of existing fill in the area, the foundations for the bridge may need to be drilled (as opposed to using driven piling) to and into bedrock in order to acquire the necessary bearing capacity and lateral resistance needed for the bridge. Bridge Option Potentially tall substructures (piers) for a bridge spanning the Rouchleau Pit for Alternative E-1A may be susceptible to vibrations and flyrock produced by nearby blasting, which could take place in the future if mining operations reconvene in the Rouchleau Pit. The bridge would need to be designed to address both possibilities. Stability of the existing haul road fill and its effects on the bridge foundations constructed on/within the submerged haul road fill is also a concern related to future mining activities, particularly blasting. Criteria for future mining would need to be established and addressed in agreements with the mine to ensure that both the submerged haul road and bridge structure are protected during future mining activities. Due to the properties of the submerged haul road fill, the foundations for the bridge would need to be drilled (as opposed to using driven piling) to and into the bedrock in order to acquire the necessary bearing capacity and lateral resistance needed for the bridge. Water levels in the Rouchleau Pit will likely vary over time due to dewatering and result in a hydraulic head differential between the east and west sides of the submerged haul road embankment. Therefore, stability and settlement of the existing fill material along with the associated effects on the foundation elements is a potential concern for bridge foundations. Both RSS and Bridge Options DNR mapping of documented underground mines in the project vicinity was reviewed. Documented underground mines are located within the Alternative E-1A area of evaluation, as shown in Figure 5.14-1. Comparisons between LiDAR data and drift elevations recorded on Minnewas underground mine maps suggest that most of the underground workings in the vicinity of Alternative E-1A were removed during subsequent open pit mining. However, mine drifts and slices which were not removed during open pit mining are documented adjacent to but outside of the proposed bridge and roadway footprint of the southbound lane and plot as close as 75 to 170 feet from either centerline (in plan view). Caving methods were employed following underground ore extraction so it is very likely that all mine slices collapsed several decades ago. Though underground workings such as drifts may have persisted, it is unlikely based on depth and proximity to the roadway and bridge structures that their presence would pose a threat at depth nor would a potential subsurface collapse pose a subsidence threat at surface. It is likely that the proposed sites of infiltration ponds located east and west of both the northbound and southbound lanes would overlay or intercept documented underground workings. School Trust land (shown in Figure 2.1-4) has a current lease that allows for the exploration, mining, and removal of nonferrous resources. Based on observations from the pit, an area underlying the southbound lane between 150 feet and 450 feet north of the proposed US 53/2nd Avenue intersection appears to be underlain by mine dump fill and glacial till, in descending order. Consequently, this area poses a potential slope stability concern. Additional borings have been acquired from this area with testing and modeling to follow. 5.14.2.5 Alternative E-2 (Straight Option and Curved Setback Option) The following areas have been identified that may require special geotechnical design and/or construction techniques to address soil, embankment, and/or vibration-related issues. East of the Rouchleau Pit there is a small pond area within the Alternative E-2 alignment that may require removal of poor/potentially organic soils or some other soil remediation (such as lightweight fill) to prevent potential settlement in this area. Mine dumps were also encountered in the pond stretch, which, depending on gradation, could also pose a settlement concern. DNR mapping of documented underground mines in the project vicinity was reviewed. DNR staff indicated that documented underground mines are located outside of the Alternative E-2 (and other project alternatives) area of evaluation, as shown in Figure 5.14-1, or else the mines have been open pit. There is a possibility that undocumented mine(s) could exist in this area. Potentially tall substructures (piers) for a bridge spanning the Rouchleau Pit for Alternative E-2 may be susceptible to vibrations and flyrock produced by nearby blasting which could take place in the future if mining operations reconvene in the Rouchleau Pit. The bridge would need to be designed to address both possibilities. Stability of the existing fill in the area and its effects on bridge foundations constructed on/within the submerged haul road is also a concern related to future mining activities, particularly blasting. Criteria for future mining would need to be established and addressed in agreements with the mine to ensure that both the mine dump fill and bridge structure remain unharmed during future mining activities. Due to the properties of existing fill in the area, the foundations for the bridge would need to be drilled (as opposed to using driven piling) to and into the bedrock in order to acquire the necessary bearing capacity and lateral resistance needed for the bridge. Potentially unstable bedrock units are also present in the highwalls and would need to be assessed if foundations are placed in these areas. Water levels in the Rouchleau Pit will likely vary over time due to mining-related dewatering. Therefore, stability and settlement/down-drag of the existing fill material is a potential concern for bridge foundations. It is possible that mining could take place in the future east of the pit and on both sides of the future roadway and bridge. Consequently, a peninsula-like bedrock structure as much as 400 to 500 feet tall would remain supporting the roadway and bridge. Stability of this structure is of particular concern since vibrations from mining coupled with perched groundwater could initiate sliding along a weak, northwestward-dipping layer found within the iron formation. An instrumentation plan would likely be implemented to monitor stability within the roadway structure. Based on observations from the pit, an area underlying the southbound lane between 150 feet and 450 feet north of the proposed US 53/2nd Avenue intersection appears to be underlain by mine dump fill and glacial till, in descending order. Consequently, this area poses a potential slope stability concern. Additional borings have been acquired from this area with testing and modeling to follow. 5.14.3 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures Efforts have been made during alternatives development and preliminary engineering of the various alternatives to understand the geotechnical constraints. Additional studies will be conducted to obtain more detailed information on the conditions to identify potential concerns more specifically for the preferred alternative. This information will be used to identify measures to avoid, minimize, or mitigate construction/design practices related to potential geotechnical and earthborne vibration issues. 5.15 Climate Change As described below, the consideration of climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is based on Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) guidance. 5.15.1 Methodology In February 2010, the CEQ issued draft guidance for addressing climate change in NEPA documents.32 The guidance indicated that: 32 “Draft NEPA Guidance on Consideration of the effects of Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions,” February 18, 2010. “The environmental analysis and documents produced in the NEPA process should provide the decision maker with relevant and timely information about the environmental effects of his or her decision and reasonable alternatives to mitigate those impacts. In this context, climate change issues arise in relation to the consideration of: (1) The GHG33 emissions effects of a proposed action and alternative actions; and (2) The relationship of climate change effects to a proposed action or alternatives, including the relationship to proposal design, environmental impacts, mitigation, and adaptation measures.” Relative to the first consideration listed above, the CEQ’s guidance goes on to state that, “in assessing direct emissions, an agency should look at the consequences of actions over which it has control or authority.” More specifically, the guidance then notes, “Federal agencies typically describe their consideration of the energy requirements of a proposed action and the conservation potential of its alternatives.” The energy requirement to consider for this proposed action is the energy use of vehicles operating on the highway, which will be expressed as a function of change in total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) for purposes of this analysis. The proposed action may result in a change in VMT due to a decrease or increase in travel distances for users of this portion of US 53, since the project would not increase roadway capacity or create any new trips. With regard to the second consideration listed above (climate change effects), CEQ guidance states, “the focus of analysis should be on the aspects of the environment that are affected by the proposed action and the significance of climate change for those aspects of the affected environment.” The effects should especially be considered in areas that are “vulnerable to specific effects of climate change (such as increasing sea level or ecological change) within the project’s timeframe.” The assessment for this factor focused first on whether any of the resources affected by the proposed project alternatives would likely be affected by climate change (e.g., increasing sea level or ecological change) and, if so, a qualitative assessment of the likely extent of effect from climate change was made. If such resources were identified, a qualitative assessment of the relationship to design, impacts, and mitigation was performed. 5.15.2 Existing Conditions As described in Section 3.1, Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) counts for the existing easement agreement area of US 53 were 22,400 vehicles per day (VPD) in 2009. Forecasts indicate that the AADT in the existing easement agreement area (forecast growth in background travel demand) is expected to increase to 24,200 VPD by 2017 (year of project completion) and 28,650 by 2037. 5.15.3 Environmental Consequences 5.15.3.1 Change in Energy Use Among the proposed project alternatives, the No Build Alternative has the largest potential for increase in energy use due to an increase in VMT. The No Build Alternative consists of rerouting traffic to a combination of existing roadways, with the primary north-south corridor (Co. 7) located approximately four miles west of US 53, which results in over seven additional miles of travel for vehicles with this alternative (compared to existing conditions). For comparison, the other proposed project alternatives would result in the following trip length changes, compared to existing: ■ Existing US 53 Alternative: no change ■ Alternative M-1: 0.7 mile decrease ■ Alternative E-1A: 0.8 mile increase ■ Alternative E-2: 1.4 mile increase 33 For purposes of CEQ guidance, “GHGs” are defined in accordance with Section 19(i) of Executive Order 13514 (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride). None of the trip length increases (or decreases) from other project alternatives would result in a noticeable change in vehicle miles traveled; therefore, none would have a substantive effect on global GHG generation. 5.15.3.2 Effects on Resources Affected By Climate Change A review of the resources affected by the proposed project alternatives compared to resources vulnerable to specific effects of climate change (such as increasing sea level or ecological change) found only one resource that may be affected by climate change and by a project alternative. The forested landscape would be impacted by Alternatives E-1A and E-2, and forest vegetation may be considered a resource vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Section 5.9.3 of this Draft EIS describes the potential project impacts on forested areas along Alternatives E-1A and E-2. There is no known way to predict the potential future impacts on the current type of forest vegetation in this area that may result from climate change. Therefore, the combined effects of the project plus climate change cannot be estimated quantitatively. However, the overall impact on the relatively extensive northern forest ecosystem of Minnesota resulting from the potential loss of approximately eight to 40 acres of forest vegetation from construction of one of the Build Alternatives would not be considered to be substantive. 5.15.4 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures No avoidance or mitigation measures are proposed since none of the project alternatives are projected to have a substantive effect on GHG emissions (i.e., energy use) or resources affected by climate change. 5.16 Construction Related Impacts 5.16.1 Environmental Consequences and Mitigation Measures 5.16.1.1 Visual and Aesthetics Visual impacts would occur during construction of all of the Build Alternatives. Temporary visual impacts include the presence of construction equipment and workers, temporary changes in the views experienced by travelers when rerouting is necessary, a decrease in vegetation in some areas, and the addition of increased time in which traffic remains in a certain area due to the increased congestion associated with construction. 5.16.1.2 Economics and Business To manage impacts on businesses during highway construction, MnDOT will follow guidance in a report developed in response to a law passed by the Minnesota State Legislature in 2008 (Laws of Minnesota 2008, chapter 308). The referenced report (Open for Business -A workbook to help Minnesota businesses survive and thrive during highway construction, 2009) can be found on MnDOT’s website34 and provides guidance based on business outreach methods/results, best practices, and lessons learned that can aid local businesses during construction. 5.16.1.3 Utilities Impacts to utilities are anticipated during construction of each of the alternatives, although these are not impact imposed by MnDOT. Impacts could include utility relocation and/or temporary interruptions in service. MnDOT will coordinate with utility providers. 34 http://www.dot.state.mn.us/businessimpacts 5.16.1.4 Noise The construction activities associated with construction of the proposed project will result in increased noise levels relative to existing conditions. These impacts will primarily be associated with construction equipment and pile driving. Table 5.16-1 shows peak noise levels monitored at 50 feet from various types of construction equipment. This equipment is primarily associated with site grading/site preparation, which is generally the roadway construction phase associated with the greatest noise levels. Table 5.16-1. Typical Construction Equipment Noise Levels at 50 feet Equipment Type  Manufacturers Sampled  Total Number of Models in Sample  Peak Noise Level (dBA) Range Average  Backhoes  5  6  74-92  83  Front Loaders  5  30  75-96  85  Dozers  8  41  65-95  85  Graders  3  15  72-92  84  Scrapers  2  27  76-98  87  Pile Drivers  N/A  N/A  95-105  101  Source: USEPA and FHWA Elevated noise levels are, to a degree, unavoidable for this type of project. MnDOT will require that construction equipment be properly muffled and in proper working order. While MnDOT and its contractor(s) are exempt from local noise ordinances, it is the practice to require contractor(s) to comply with applicable local noise restrictions and ordinances to the extent that is reasonable. Advanced notice will be provided to affected communities of any planned abnormally loud construction activities. It is anticipated that night construction may be required to expedite construction, minimize traffic impacts, and improve safety. However, construction will be limited to daytime hours as much as possible. This project is expected to be under construction for two construction seasons. Any associated high-impact equipment noise, such as pile driving, pavement sawing, or jack hammering, will be unavoidable with construction of the proposed project. Pile driving noise is associated with any bridge construction and sheet piling necessary for retaining wall construction. High-impact noise construction activities will be limited in duration to the greatest extent possible, with the understanding that construction will likely be under an accelerated schedule. 5.16.1.5 Transportation-Related Air Quality Air quality impacts from construction include increased dust and airborne particulates caused by grading, filling, removals, and other construction activities. Dust impacts would be minimized through standard dust control measures such as watering. After construction is complete, dust levels are expected to return to near existing conditions. Air quality impacts may also result from emissions from construction equipment and possibly from traffic stopped at intersecting roadways or on potential detour routes. These impacts are expected to be minimal and of short duration. 5.16.1.6 Hazardous and Regulated Materials A management plan would be developed for properly handling, treating, storing, and disposing of solid wastes, hazardous materials, petroleum products, and other regulated materials/wastes that are used or generated during construction. The plan would also establish protocol to minimize impacts to soils and groundwater in the event a release of hazardous substances occurs during construction. If a release were to occur, the Minnesota Duty Officer would be contacted immediately to make the required agency contacts. In the event that any spill of vehicle fluids and/or fuels is encountered during construction, the appropriate response protocol required by the MnDOT Technical Memorandum No. 11-10-M-02 would be followed. Prior to the demolition of any structures, assessments for asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paint, and other regulated building materials/wastes would be performed. A demolition and disposal plan would be prepared for any identified contaminants that may be encountered during construction. If used as a construction material on this project, handling of taconite tailings would be completed in conformance with the project special provisions and the MnDOT Guidance Document #36: Best Management Practice: Taconite Tailings Road Aggregate. The guidance document is included in Appendix I. 5.16.1.7 Excess Materials During construction, if excess material is to be disposed of outside of the project limits, the contractor will develop a disposal plan that must be approved by the MnDOT Project Engineer. Disposal of excess material will be in compliance with the guidelines listed in the standard specifications, including MnDOT specifications, FHWA policies, and environmental laws and regulations. Disposal will not occur in wetlands, floodplains, or other sensitive areas. The contractor would dispose of unusable excavated material in accordance with state regulations and special provisions to ensure protection of wetlands and waterways. All waste and demolition material from project construction activities will be disposed of in accordance with the standard specifications or special provisions to ensure protection of wetlands and waterways. Erosion and sedimentation will be controlled in accordance with temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control plans, MnDOT Standard Plans and standard specifications, and local ordinances. 5.16.1.8 Geotechnical and Earthborn Vibrations The project may require blasting, pile driving, dynamic compaction, ordinary compaction, and/or pavement breaking or the operation of other construction equipment that may result in temporary earthborn vibrations that have the potential to affect homes. The location and magnitude of construction vibrations cannot be assessed until the final design phase of the project. However, the typical practice is to use vibration monitoring, and if the vibrations reach a certain level, require that the contractor shut down and revise operations to reduce earthborn vibrations. Construction vibration would need to be distinguished from mine generated vibration. 5.16.1.9 Stormwater The MPCA serves as the permitting authority for stormwater issues related to roadway construction, including a general stormwater permit for construction activity under Phase II of the NPDES. Compliance with the NPDES permit would be met through the use of BMPs to mitigate impacts of roadway construction affecting water quality. Stormwater features would be used for runoff treatment and attenuation, where practical, and determined if necessary during more detailed design of the preferred alternative. A NPDES permit would be obtained from the MPCA prior to construction. This permit would include an erosion control plan, as well as BMPs contained in MnDOT’s standard specifications, details, and special provisions. Special consideration would be given to steep slope areas, specifically in the pit crossing areas (Alternative M-1, E-1A, or E-2) to stabilize long, steep slopes. After construction, all disturbed areas would be sodded or seeded, leaving temporary erosion control structures in place until vegetation has been established. Erosion and sedimentation of these and all other exposed soils within the project corridor would be minimized by utilizing the appropriate BMPs during construction. Implementation of BMPs in the final construction and site grading plans greatly reduces the amount of construction-related sedimentation and helps to control erosion and runoff. Ditches, dikes, siltation fences, bale checks, and sedimentation basins would be utilized, as needed, as temporary erosion control measures during construction. 5.16.1.10 Water Supply and Waterbody Modifications Section 5.3 describes dewatering options considered for construction of the Alternative E-1A RSS Option, including a pit drawdown option to allow placement of fill under dry conditions. Potential receiving waters and impacts for this option are described in Section 5.3. All of the receiving water options from Rouchleau Pit drawdown dewatering operations were analyzed for their capacity to receive the water volume and the potential water quality permit requirements (see Section 5.3). The options that are recommended would be considered water transfers to waters of the state and would not be subject to MPCA water quality permitting, provided that there is no intervening commercial or industrial use of the water and no pollutants are introduced. Other permitting details regarding water appropriations are provided in Section 5.3.4.2. The piping infrastructure needed to direct water from the Rouchleau Pit to receiving waters would be routed through previously disturbed areas (e.g., existing right-of-way, mined land) to the extent possible. The flexible piping (three 30-inch HDPE pipes) would be laid on top of existing ground for most of the route and removed after construction is complete to limit ground disturbance. The only grading required would be where the pipes cross existing roads, driveways, and railroad tracks, where excavation or boring the pipes through the road would be needed. The extent of the excavation would be limited to the width and depth of the pipes to allow the road/railroad to continue operations. These piping routes were reviewed for other potential environmental resource impacts, are based on routes that follow previously disturbed areas (Figure 5.3-1), and would be in place for a short duration (estimated three months for initial dewatering and up to six months for maintenance dewatering), no potential substantial impacts were identified. Assessment of potential impacts included: ■ Cultural: MnDOT CRU reviewed piping routes and concluded no potential adverse effect (see Appendix C) ■ Natural: Aerial photos, floodplain maps, and previously gathered data for the Draft EIS were reviewed for the piping routes and concluded there are no floodplains, rare species, parkland, or forested areas within these corridors, thus no potential for impacts ■ Water Resources: Because the piping would not result in any permanent placement of pipes and would result in limited physical changes to natural ground (already disturbed areas of roads, driveways, or railroad tracks), there would be no permanent wetland impacts, changes to runoff, or other surface water impacts. Receiving waters will have temporary improved water quality through the addition of water from the Rouchleau Pit (see Section 5.3). ■ Social: There may be temporary impacts to traffic in areas where the pipes need to be extended/cut under streets, driveways, or tracks The potential dewatering for the project and resulting impact on groundwater levels would not be expected to cause an issue with operation of wells in the Biwabik Iron Formation within one mile of the Rouchleau Pit, especially considering that the pit historically has had much lower water elevations than 1,275 feet (for example, the pit lake elevation was approximately 1,240 feet in 2000). However, it is recommended that the water levels in these wells be measured before and during dewatering to monitor impacts to the wells. The water level in the wells should be compared to the depth setting of the well pumps. The construction of any of the Build Alternatives would require a NPDES/SDS Stormwater Construction Activity Permit, which may be covered under the State’s Construction Stormwater General Permit. As part of the application process, the owner and operator must create a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) that explains how stormwater will be controlled to prevent introduction of sediment and other pollutants transported by runoff. Any equipment, materials, or personnel coming into contact with the Rouchleau Pit water due to dewatering or construction may transfer aquatic invasive species (AIS) into the Rouchleau Pit. Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent any potential transfers of AIS into the water. Examples include having any equipment or material used for dewatering or construction exposed to dry conditions for at least five days before coming into contact with the waterbody. 5.16.1.11 Traffic Construction of any of the Build Alternatives would result in minor disruptions to existing traffic since all Build Alternatives include new alignments of US 53, thus constructed away from existing traffic except at the end points and the new intersections/interchanges. Temporary detours or traffic disruptions may occur near Cuyuna Drive, Landfill Road, MN 135, and 2nd Avenue. MnDOT will provide advanced warning for construction in these areas and install clear signage for temporary access and detours. Blasting may be required for construction of each Build Alternative, which could result in some additional temporary road closures similar to those experienced for mine blasting. However, much of the construction for the Build Alternatives is on new alignments and can be constructed with minimal disruption to current US 53 travelers. Blasting, when needed, will be scheduled for minimal traffic disruption. 5.17 Relationship of Local Short-Term Use vs. Long-Term Productivity All highway projects require the investment or commitment of some resources found in the existing environment. Short-term refers to the immediate consequences of the project whereas long-term relates to its direct or secondary effects on future generations. 5.17.1.1 Potential Adverse Use Temporary Reduction of Energy and Material Resources Materials consumed in the construction of any of the Build Alternatives would be unavailable for other uses, including construction of other non-highway related facilities. The energy consumed in the construction, maintenance, and operation of the facility is higher than the energy consumed by the No Build Alternative in the short-term. Temporary Loss of Vegetation In addition to permanent loss of vegetation as a result of the Build Alternatives, construction activities would result in additional temporary losses of vegetation adjacent to the roadway improvements. Revegetation activities would be coordinated with other erosion control and stabilization components of the project to minimize impacts. Visual quality would also be considered in selecting appropriate methods and materials for revegetation. Temporary Loss of Wetlands The alternatives would directly impact varying amounts of existing wetlands. The impact on wetlands cannot be completely avoided due to the scattered distribution and limited options for realignment due to the presence of active mining areas. However, the preferred alternative design will incorporate avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures, and compensatory mitigation areas will be discussed in the Final EIS. Compensatory mitigation will assist in minimizing the potential loss of wetland functions and values within the project area. Temporary Impacts on Water Resources Alternatives E-1A and E-2 have the potential to create temporary impacts to the Rouchleau Pit by implementing a crossing of the pit. Disruption to this waterbody will be minimized to the extent feasible for the preferred alternative. Short-Term Economic Impacts The construction of the relocated highway would require the acquisition of property and would remove this land from tax rolls, resulting in some short-term loss of property tax revenues. This temporary loss is anticipated to be offset by the increased value of land served by the new highway location and ore access. Alternatives E-1A and E-2 would also require full acquisition and relocation of a business. Given the availability of a number of potential replacement sites in the area, short-term loss in tax revenues would be negligible. Temporary changes in the conduct of business may occur until highway improvements are fully integrated. These impacts will be minimized through wayfinding signage and frequent project schedule updates during construction. Inconveniences from Construction Construction would cause minor traffic delays and detours for motorists in the area. This may result in higher levels of congestion. Significant Capital Investment Financial commitments to the project include acquisition, relocation, and construction costs. These public dollars would not be available for other uses. In addition, the land converted to highway use represents a reduction in tax base. These costs would be recovered by continuing to provide a transportation facility that would safely maintain adequate roadway capacity and mobility as well as local, regional, and interregional connectivity while meeting the terms of the current agreement with RGGS. 5.17.1.2 Long-Term Gains in Productivity Improve Travel Time and Minimize Cost of Travel For the Existing US 53 and Build Alternatives, a four-lane highway would have the ability to accommodate existing and forecast traffic volumes. The presence of free-flowing traffic would generally maintain or possibly improve motorist travel times and fuel consumption, which would reduce the overall cost of travel. The No Build Alternative would reroute traffic onto two-lane roadways and would result in substantial losses in productivity due to increased travel times. Economic Benefit The economic advantage lies in the long-term efficiencies that a transportation system will provide. These efficiencies include travel time savings, development opportunities, and increased consumer activity due to enhanced mobility and exposure. With the exception of the No Build Alternative, which would have adverse economic impacts, the Build and Existing US 53 Alternatives maintain the status quo for traffic/travel times and provide possible growth opportunities. The new intersections associated with Build Alternatives may provide opportunity for new highway-related commercial development. The No Build Alternative is expected to have limited and temporary benefits to select communities (Eveleth), with traffic increases on Co. 101 and Co. 7 heightening the potential for increased opportunity for new businesses and consumer activity at the local level until Co. 101 is closed to through traffic in 2024. 5.18 Irreversible and Irretrievable Impacts 5.18.1 Land Consumption The amount of land required for the Build Alternatives is similar, ranging from approximately 80 to 154 acres. There would be no acquisition of land required under the No Build and Existing US 53 Alternatives. Land used in the construction of the proposed project is considered an irreversible commitment during the time period that the land is used for a highway facility. Portions of the facility may be subject to easement agreements with the mining operation. The priority of MnDOT and FHWA is to ensure that this current investment in infrastructure is supported by the length of the easement so full use and life of the infrastructure may be realized. 5.18.2 Social and Cultural Resources The displacement and relocation of residences, businesses, and other resources of the built environment (public and private) are considered to be irreversible and irretrievable. Displacements and relocations are very limited for the project, with displacement of only one business proposed under Alternative E-2 and two businesses under Alternative E-1A. 5.18.3 Energy Resources Several energy resources will be committed to plan, design, manufacture materials, and conduct improvements to the highway system. The use of fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and petroleum), water, and labor expenditures for both construction and maintenance of the facility are considered irreversible and irretrievable. Use of construction materials, such as cement, aggregate, and bituminous material, is generally considered irretrievable; however, these materials are not in short supply, and their use would not have an adverse effect upon continued availability. In addition, some of these materials may have salvage value and may be recycled at the end of the facility’s design life. 5.18.4 Financial Resources The proposed improvements would require a considerable expenditure of both state and federal funds which are not retrievable. While these public funds are not directly retrievable, the money spent can be considered a long-term investment in the economic vitality of the region. 5.18.5 Natural Resources The proposed improvements may require the commitment of natural resources including the loss of vegetation, wetland functions and values, and other wildlife habitat. The commitment of these resources may in part be irreversible and irretrievable. Avoidance and minimization measures will be incorporated into final design of the preferred alternative. Mitigation measures will be employed in attempt to counter remaining impacts to natural resources. Service Layer Credits: Source: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, i-cubed, USDA, USGS, AEX, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, swisstopo, and the GIS User Community Bailey St. Louis County Regional Landfill Lake ( C !

The terms “effect” and “impact” are used synonymously in the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations (40 CFR 1508.8). “Secondary impact” does not appear, nor is it defined in either the CEQ regulations or related guidance. However, the term is used in the Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA) guidance (with the same definition as the CEQ definition of indirect impact). For the purpose of this discussion, secondary and indirect impacts area assumed to have the same meaning, and indirect will be used in this section. 6.1 Methodology The CEQ has defined direct and indirect impacts (40 CFR 1508.7). Direct impacts are impacts caused by the proposed action and occur at the same time and place. As discussed throughout Chapters 3: Transportation Analysis, 4: Community and Social Analysis, and 5: Physical and Environmental Analysis of this Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), direct impacts are typically those that can be measured immediately after completion of the project (e.g., acres of land acquired or wetlands filled). According to the CEQ, an indirect impact is caused by a specific project or action but later in time or farther away, yet is still reasonably foreseeable. Indirect impacts may include growth-inducing effects related to changes in the pattern of land use, population density, or growth rate, and related effects on air and water and other natural systems, including ecosystems. Indirect impacts were evaluated considering appropriate geographic boundaries and timeframes. Figure 3.1-1 shows the area’s regional transportation network with forecast average daily traffic (ADTs), which provides a reference for areas where there are traffic volume changes due to the project (No Build Alternative and background growth) which may influence local land use changes. The time frame considered for indirect impacts was generally defined as the years immediately following the termination of the existing easement agreement area (post 2017). This analysis compares alternatives with respect to indirect impacts (i.e., potential land use/development pattern changes) that may occur as a result of project, including changes in highway location, traffic volumes, traffic patterns, and/or access to the transportation system. If a potential indirect impact on land use was identified, an assessment of potential environmental impacts resulting from that land use change was also performed. 6.2 Consequences and Mitigation 6.2.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) Under this alternative, the existing easement agreement area along a portion of US 53 would be abandoned and traffic would be rerouted to MN 37, Co. 7, and US 169. Traffic would also be expected to increase on Co. 101 even though it would not be signed as the route for US 53. Traffic volumes are expected to increase substantially on these roadways. As detailed in Section 3.1.1, in 2017 (the year the US 53 closure would occur) average daily traffic volumes are expected to increase compared to existing volumes by up to 214 percent along MN 37, 323 percent along Co. 7 south of Co. 101, and 137 percent along US 169 just west of Virginia (Traffic Analysis Technical Report, CH2M Hill, 2013). Expected changes in travel patterns and traffic volumes on the rerouted roadways are shown in Figure 3.1-3. These could result in shifts in land use and economic development, as described below. Indirectly, as a result of these traffic volume forecast increases, interest may be generated in highway-related development or redevelopment opportunities along these roadways in Mountain Iron and Eveleth. As a result, land use could shift over time from predominantly residential/rural to more business and commercial use. This increased development could result in impacts to wetlands, wooded areas, and other undeveloped areas that currently existing along these roadways. This could result in loss of wildlife habitat and visual changes within the corridors. With more development and potentially more people located near transportation corridors, the number of receptors exposed to roadway noise may also increase. Future development may also necessitate the construction of supporting infrastructure, such as local access roadways and utilities. Therefore, increased development could result in increased tax base and an increase in employment in Mountain Iron and Eveleth. Conversely, traffic volumes are forecast to drop from an ADT of 17,150 vehicles per day to 7,900 vehicles per day in 2017 near 12th Avenue on the remnant segments of US 53. Because the No Build Alternative drastically changes traffic patterns around the city of Virginia, businesses along US 53 in the Midway area and between 2nd Avenue and US 169 would experience less visibility and require longer trips to reach. Many of the businesses, particularly in the area closer to Virginia, generate a significant amount of business by people driving by (fast food, grocery, gas station, etc.), resulting in substantial decreased business volume along these disconnected segments of US 53. Some residents of the Iron Range already shop in the Duluth area for destination retail goods and services. Given the larger concentration and variety of retail stores and services in Duluth, some shoppers would change their shopping patterns due to the increases in travel times to combine purchases of goods that they currently buy in Virginia to more frequent trips to Duluth, diverting sales from the Virginia retail areas to stores in Duluth. The level of economic impact to local businesses has been evaluated as part of the Highway 53 Relocation Economic Impact Study (McComb Group and SEH, 2014), which found that due to reduced accessibility/visibility to existing businesses along US 53, it is expected that the No Build Alternative would present a high potential for reduced revenues, business closures, job losses, and reductions in local tax base and general property tax revenues in Virginia. It is also expected that some traffic between Gilbert and Virginia would not use the designated US 53 reroute but would instead use Co. 101 (until its potential closure in 2024) and MN 37 to access Co. 7. This is anticipated to result in a 253 percent increase in traffic on Co. 101 adjacent to Eveleth, and a 164 percent increase in traffic on MN 37 leading into Gilbert. The increased traffic on Co. 101 would also use Co. 7 north of Co. 101, which is projected to increase volumes on that segment from 2,250 vehicles today to 23,200 vehicles in 2017 (an increase of over 900 percent). 6.2.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) If the existing US 53 alignment remains, the roadway will remain open to traffic and no significant increases in daily traffic volumes are anticipated from what occurs today. No indirect impacts are anticipated relative to land use or other impact categories such as wetlands or natural areas. However, as an indirect result of making a large volume of ferrous resources inaccessible to mining (i.e., by the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) purchasing the mineral rights), this alternative is expected to have potential long term impacts on the Quad Cities economy. The exact nature and extent of all potential indirect economic impacts of reduced taconite production in the area is not possible to forecast but would include businesses in the Quad Cities and industries in Minnesota that support ferrous resource mining, with additional indirect economic impacts to occur for businesses outside of Minnesota. 6.2.3 Alternative M-1 Minimal changes to businesses along US 53 would be expected given that the traffic patterns would not change substantially under this alternative due to the limited possibility of induced changes in land use or traffic. The lands adjacent to Alternative M-1 would not be likely to change in their use, as they are primarily disturbed land within an active mine. However, the land outside the mine lands near the new intersection locations for 2nd Avenue (via the new Southern Drive intersection) and for MN 135 may experience a change to highway-related commercial business such as gas stations, convenience stores, coffee shops, or restaurants given changes in access and visibility. A number of these parcels are currently vacant or underdeveloped and may be available for new or redevelopment opportunities. If these parcels have wetlands, the proposed developments would be required to comply with current wetland permit requirements, including mitigation plans. 6.2.4 Alternative E-1A Minimal changes to businesses along US 53 would be expected given that the traffic patterns would not change substantially under this alternative due to the limited possibility of induced changes in land use or traffic. The lands adjacent to Alternative E-1A would not be likely to change in their use, as they are on state land primarily reserved for recreational or mining use, or on land that is already developed. However, the land outside the mine lands near the new intersection locations for 2nd Avenue and for MN 135 may experience a change to highway-related commercial business such as gas stations, convenience stores, coffee shops, or restaurants given changes in access and visibility. A number of these parcels are currently vacant or underdeveloped and may be available for new or redevelopment opportunities. If these parcels have wetlands, the proposed developments would be required to comply with current wetland permit requirements, including mitigation plans. 6.2.5 Alternative E-2 Minimal changes to businesses along US 53 would be expected given that the traffic patterns would not change substantially under this alternative due to the limited possibility of induced changes in land use or traffic. The lands adjacent to Alternative E-2 would not be likely to change in their use, as they are on state land primarily reserved for recreational or mining use or on land that is already developed. However, the land outside the mine lands near the new intersection locations for 2nd Avenue and for MN 135 may experience a change to highway-related commercial business such as gas stations, convenience stores, coffee shops, or restaurants given changes in access and visibility. A number of these parcels are currently vacant or underdeveloped and may be available for new or redevelopment opportunities. If these parcels have wetlands, the proposed developments would be required to comply with current wetland permit requirements, including mitigation plans. 7.0 Cumulative Impacts This chapter considers the potential cumulative impacts of the US 53 project combined with other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions. 7.1 Methodology Minnesota Rules, part 4410.2300, item H requires that regulatory governmental units include a discussion of cumulative impacts in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Cumulative impacts are also defined by the federal Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) as “impacts on the environment that result from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (federal or non-federal) or person undertakes such other actions” (40 CFR 158.7). Cumulative impacts are not necessarily causally linked to the proposed US 53 alternatives. Rather, they are the total effect of all known actions (past, present, and future) in the vicinity of the proposed project with impacts on the same types of resources. The purpose of cumulative impacts analysis is to look for impacts that may be individually minimal but which could accumulate and become significant and adverse when combined with the effects of other actions. The cumulative impacts analysis is limited to resources, ecosystems, and human communities affected by the US 53 project alternatives (i.e., recreational lands and trails, economics, community connections, utilities, water supply/groundwater, wetlands, surface water quality/storm water, noise, vegetation, and hazardous materials). The study area varies by resource category but generally includes areas around each of the proposed alternative alignments under consideration, including the No Build Alternative. The time frames considered, in general, include past actions that have affected resources to be assessed and assessment of foreseeable future impacts approximately one to 30 years forward in time (depending on the resource), which is considered a reasonable planning timeframe. To determine cumulative impacts to these resources and areas, information was gathered relating to current and foreseeable future projects in the study area. This information was collected by reviewing available plans and permits, including contacting the cities, county, and landowners in the study area. The projects considered in the cumulative impacts assessment are described in the next section. 7.2 Scope of Analysis 7.2.1 Past Actions Iron ore mining has been and remains a dominant activity within the study area and has had a substantial effect on area social, economic, and environmental resources. Mining in the Rouchleau Pit, on the east side of Virginia, stopped in late the 1980s. Since that time, water in the pit has risen and now stabilized, and most of the land area disturbed by past mining activity has revegetated. The Auburn Pit area south of Virginia is still active and is known as the UTAC mine. Land uses adjacent to the project corridors and outside the mined areas are generally residential/rural residential with business development along US 53 that has been gradually expanding, primarily within the Quad Cities. Significant development projects in the nearby area have included the new P&H MinePro Services facility just west of US 53 and south of US 169 in Virginia (completed in 2012), and the addition of a new clinic to the Essentia Health-Virginia (former Virginia Regional Medical Center) in 2005, located on 9th Street North in Virginia. There have been no major roadway changes in the study area vicinity in the past several years. Minor projects in the immediate area include bridge deck resurfacing on MN 37 over US 53 in Eveleth, improvements to Alaska Avenue in Gilbert, and a number of reclaim and overlay projects completed by St. Louis County in the project area in 2012,2013, and 2014, including a segment of Co. 7 between Co. 101 and US 169, segments of Cedar Island Drive, Ely Lake Drive, and Sparta Road near Ely Lake southeast of Eveleth, Jones Street through Eveleth (Routes 146 and 147), and segments of Routes 776 and 329 east of Iron Junction. 7.2.2 Future Anticipated Actions In addition to the proposed US 53 project, the following additional future projects were identified through coordination with jurisdictions and landowners in the study area. Table 7.2-1 Additional Future Projects Project Description  Proposer  Timeframe  Potential Environmental Impacts of Action  General development planned for parcels on north side of MN 135, west of MN 37 in Gilbert area  City of Gilbert  Over next 20 years  economics, utilities, wetlands, surface water quality  Existing and potential future mining and mining-related activities within the permit to mine and environmental setting boundaries  UTAC/RGGS  Current permit through 2040, with ability to extend or modify  water supply, trails, wetlands, surface water quality, economics, noise, utilities  Continue mining and mining-related activities within the permit to mine area and environmental setting boundary to the southwest, includes closing Co. 101 west of Eveleth for mine crossing  UTAC  2024  Community connection, traffic  Expansion of mine in Mountain Iron  Minntac  Project will extend mine life and taconite production to 2031  water supply, trails, wetlands, surface water quality, economics, noise, utilities  Reconfiguration of water supply systems  City of Virginia  Undetermined; study underway  utilities, water supply  Expansion of Iron Range Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area (OHVRA) east of Virginia  Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR)  2013-2015  vegetation, noise, wetlands, surface water quality  7.2.3 Impacts and Mitigation This section addresses the resource areas for which the proposed project will cause direct or indirect impacts and for which past and other anticipated future actions would also be expected to cause impacts. Only those issue areas which are directly or indirectly impacted by both the US 53 project and past and/or other anticipated future projects are discussed below. 7.2.3.1 Recreational Lands and Trails Impacts of US 53 Alternatives Impacts to the Mesabi Trail and a portion of the Trail Hawks Snowmobile Club Spur trail as a result of the US 53 project (new crossings of trail by US 53), specifically Alternatives E-1A and E-2, could be mitigated to maintain trail access at crossing locations (signal, bridge, or tunnel). Impacts to the OHVRA by Alternatives E-1A and E-2 are expected to be negligible (acquisition of property that has no impact on recreational use, features, or attributes). Impacts of Past/Future Projects Permitted mining activity would directly affect/eliminate portions of the Mesabi Trail and local snowmobile trails under all alternatives, at the time when RGGS terminates license agreements for trail use. No mitigation is stipulated in the current agreement with these users. There are no known impacts planned to the OHVRA by other projects. Cumulative Impacts/Mitigation The mining trail impacts would eliminate the trail section across the mine, rendering the Minnesota Department of Transportation’s (MnDOT) trail mitigation ineffective. MnDOT will work with UTAC/RGGS and local trail authorities to create a corridor via permit for trail use along the east side of Alternatives E-1A and E-2, with trail construction to be completed by others. The trail options for Alternative M-1 are expected to follow the No Build reroute alignment. It is the desire of UTAC/RGGS and the St. Louis and Lake Counties Regional Railroad Authority (SLLCRRA) to reconstruct the trail concurrent with US 53 road construction. SLLCRRA has received state bond funds for the trail relocation. No further mitigation can be defined at this time. 7.2.3.2 Economics Impacts of US 53 Alternatives The US 53 project is anticipated to have no economic impacts to the local economy, unless the No Build Alternative is selected. The No Build Alternative would increase travel times for destinations across the Biwabik Iron Formation, increase traffic volumes on the reroute of US 53, decrease traffic volumes along the US 53 business strip between 12th and 2nd Avenues and Midway, and result in substantial sales and job losses in the area. These changes would result in reduced business along the US 53 corridor nearest the existing easement agreement area segment due to traffic pattern changes. However, it may temporarily result in some new development along the new reroute corridors until Co. 101 is closed to through traffic (estimated in 2024). From a mine operations perspective, the Existing US 53, M-1, and E-2 Alternatives could restrict access to substantial quantities of ferrous resources, which could affect the long-term viability of the mining company and local economy. Alternative E-1A may also limit access to some ferrous resources but to a much lesser extent than the other alternatives. Alternative M-1 and the Alternative E-1A Bridge Option, by going through the permit to mine area, create potential business operation risks due to the effect on the mine’s ability to comply with its air quality permit. MnDOT has identified mitigation measures for its contribution to this potential impact (see Section 4.2 regarding mitigation). Impacts of Past/Future Projects Past mining activity in the area has certainly affected the local economy through employment, induced development, and retail and property expenditures. Permits exist or are planned for continued mining in the area in the future (20 to 30 years). This will continue to stimulate the local economy by providing employment opportunities and drawing more workers to the area, who will in turn spend more money in the area. The Taconite Production Tax also provides a significant contribution to the local economy. Cumulative Impacts/Mitigation If the mine cannot meet ambient air quality standards, this could limit mining operations, thereby limiting economic potential of the mine and in turn the amount of Taconite Production Tax generated. MnDOT and UTAC worked on measures to mitigate potential air quality compliance impacts on UTAC’s operations through roadway design, minimizing mine dust generation, and development of a plan to minimize potential exposure of highway users to mine air emissions through incorporation of highway design measures (see Section 4.2.4 regarding mitigation). Potential (see Chapter 6: Indirect/Secondary Impacts) and other future anticipated actions increase access to businesses in the area and expand the base of potential local consumers. These developments would be reviewed by appropriate City staff, and mitigation for impacts to wetlands, surface waters, and other regulated resources would be provided. No further mitigation is required. 7.2.3.3 Community Connections Impacts of US 53 Alternatives The No Build Alternative would remove direct connections between some cities in the area, thereby causing school bus rerouting and lengthened emergency response and travel times between those cities. Impacts to connectivity and travel times would not be noticeable for the Existing US 53, M-1, E-1A, or E-2 Alternatives. Impacts of Past/Future Projects In general, past and future planned projects have not and are not anticipated to create substantial reroutes or lengthen travel or emergency response times, except for the expected closure of Co. 101 to through traffic, just west of Eveleth, by 2024. UTAC has indicated that mining in this area will require a portion of Co. 101 to close and has not indicated whether the road alignment will be replaced. Connectivity between cities in the area is not anticipated to be affected by any of the other future projects. Cumulative Impacts/Mitigation Community connections would only be affected by the proposed No Build Alternative and the future closure of Co. 101. The traffic and economic sections of this Draft EIS address the potential cumulative impacts to these resources. No potential mitigation other than project mitigation described in Section 4.7.4 has been identified. 7.2.3.4 Utilities Impacts of US 53 Alternatives Utility relocation would be required for all of the alternatives except the Existing US 53 Alternative, with the greatest potential impact from the No Build and M-1 Alternatives. However, given the advanced time for planning and reconstruction of utilities, this is not anticipated to cause major interruptions in service. Impacts of Past/Future Projects Continued development projects in the study area over time will put an increased demand on utility systems. Cumulative Impacts/Mitigation Effects of future projects, combined with natural population growth and the direct effects of the US 53 project, may cumulatively add to the demands on the customer base of utilities in the study area. To meet any increased demand of utilities from anticipated future development and the other anticipated future projects, providers would plan appropriately through their regular planning processes. No further mitigation is required. 7.2.3.5 Water Supply/Groundwater Impacts of US 53 Alternatives Alternatives E-1A and E-2 would be within Virginia’s Inner Emergency Response Area, which is an area more susceptible to drinking water contamination due to contaminant releases or other threats. Best management practices (BMPs) implemented by MnDOT would minimize potential water quality impacts. The Rouchleau Pit water would continue to be monitored by the City for turbidity and other contaminants. Impacts of Past/Future Projects Past mining activity in the area has required extensive dewatering and changes to area water levels. Expansion of the UTAC mine or potential southwest expansion of the ArcelorMittal/Minorca mine into the Rouchleau Pit has been identified by the City and the mine operator(s) as a potential future impact to the existing water supply. As mining activity approaches the Rouchleau Pit, at some point dewatering would be necessary to allow for mine operations, resulting in a drop in the water level of the Rouchleau Pit. The city of Virginia relies on the pit for drinking water, so the water supply would need to be assessed as part of mining activities that could affect that pit. Cumulative Impacts/Mitigation Alternatives E-1A and E-2 would implement mitigation measures to minimize and avoid potential impacts to Rouchleau Pit water quality. The Alternative E-1A RSS Option may temporarily (18 months) drawdown the water level in the Rouchleau Pit; whereas the mining impacts on water supply would be long-term (dozens of years) on water levels. Additionally, the mining impact to the water supply would not occur within the same timeframe as the roadway relocation project, and the mining activity in the Rouchleau Pit area will occur regardless of which road alignment is selected. Mitigation for potential water quality impacts for the US 53 project and for future mining activity would be provided, as required by NPDES and other permit requirements. Impacts related to road and mine activities on water levels would be addressed through respective DNR water appropriation permits. No further mitigation is required. 7.2.3.6 Water Body Modifications and Wetlands Impacts of US 53 Alternatives Alternatives M-1, E-1A, and E-2 would have an impact on adjacent wetlands, affecting up to 9, 11, and 9 acres, respectively. The No Build and Existing US 53 Alternatives would not impact wetlands. Only Alternatives E-1A and E-2 have the potential to affect the body of water in the Rouchleau Pit. The Alternative E-1A RSS Option may require substantial dewatering that could affect water levels temporarily in other downstream (discharge) waters. Impacts of Past/Future Projects Past and current mining activity in the area has required extensive dewatering and has changed water levels in surrounding surface waters, including wetlands. Future mining in the study area may include dewatering of the Rouchleau Pit and expansion of mining between the Auburn and Rouchleau Pits. This may have the potential to impact adjacent wetlands and waterbodies; however, without a specific mining plan these impacts cannot be certain. Past mine dewatering may have also affected water quality in downstream waters (i.e., Manganika Lake is high in methyl mercury). Cumulative Impacts/Mitigation Past mining and filling of the Rouchleau Pit and future mining and dewatering of the Rouchleau Pit could result in a lower water elevation in the pit. Alternative E-1A would cross the pit along an existing submerged haul road embankment (RSS Option or Bridge Option), and Alternative E-2 would cross the pit with a bridge, avoiding most impacts to the pit. US 53 wetland impacts would be mitigated consistent with obtained wetland, NPDES, and appropriation permits/approvals. Under current state and federal laws, the mine operator/owner would be required to determine if the affected wetland areas are jurisdictional or regulated and obtain the appropriate approvals and replacement required, similar to the US 53 project. The extent of potential impacts to wetlands by mining activities cannot be estimated without a mining plan (which provides information such as depth and amount of dewatering), and such a plan does not currently exist. However, the impacts would be mitigated so there would be no cumulative impact on wetlands. Dewatering impacts from the US 53 project would be temporary if they occur and primarily result from the volume of water transferred in a short period of time (during construction) versus mining dewatering which would drop water levels over a much longer time period (decades). Both actions would require obtaining necessary permits from the DNR and Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) and mitigate impacts to discharge/receiving waters. 7.2.3.7 Surface Water Quality/Stormwater Impacts of US 53 Alternatives Each of the alternatives, except the Existing US 53 Alternative, would result in a net decrease in impervious surface area, and treatment of stormwater would not be required. However, for Alternatives M-1, E-1A, and E-2, water quality treatment of the runoff from the pit crossing areas would be necessary to maintain the existing level of water quality treatment in the study area. Stormwater ponding would be designed to meet the requirements of the NPDES permit for water quality treatment for the assumed areas with constrained cross section. Impacts of Past/Future Projects It would be expected that future mining expansion and highway and development projects could increase impervious area and/or increase stormwater runoff. Under the Existing US 53, M-1, E-1A, or E-2 Alternatives, mining by UTAC of the pit crossing areas would cut off the stormwater east of the Rouchleau Pit that currently crosses along the north side of US 53, requiring rerouting of this flow to another receiving water. These projects would be subject to state and federal requirements. Cumulative Impacts/Mitigation The identified past, present, and future projects may incur some level of stormwater runoff which may affect nearby surface waters. Stormwater would be regulated, and mitigation would be completed on a project-by-project basis, as required by state and federal regulations. Therefore, there would be no cumulative impact on surface water quality and stormwater given that the impacts would be mitigated. 7.2.3.8 Noise Impacts of US 53 Alternatives The No Build, M-1, E-1A, and E-2 Alternatives would move the traffic noise source from the existing US 53 corridor to a new corridor, therefore affecting different receptors. Noise walls would be implemented in areas where noise regulatory thresholds are exceeded, consistent with MnDOT’s noise policy (i.e., where determined feasible and cost effective). Impacts of Past/Future Projects Traffic from anticipated future development projects would contribute to future traffic noise generation; however, those potential impacts have already been accounted for in the future traffic forecasts used for the US 53 traffic noise analysis. Implementation of future mine expansion projects and/or the OHVRA facility may also increase or change the location of noise generation from activities at those facilities. If noise generation exceeds regulatory thresholds, special permit conditions or implementation of mitigation may be required. For example, the DNR has source standards for off-road vehicles, and the MPCA regulates noise as per the requirements of Minnesota Rules, part 7030. Cumulative Impacts/Mitigation Each separate project would be responsible for mitigating its own noise impacts based on regulatory requirements. Also, identified future projects are far enough apart geographically that any increase in noise is not likely to affect the same populations, and, therefore, cumulative effects would be minimal. 7.2.3.9 Vegetation/Cover Types Impacts of US 53 Alternatives Alternatives M-1, E-1A, and E-2 would result in localized loss of vegetation in some areas. No mitigation is required for these impacts other than revegetation and stabilization of disturbed areas. Impacts of Past/Future Projects Permits exist for continued mining in the area in the future. Mining activity will likely remove existing vegetation. When mining areas are abandoned, it is likely that these areas would be revegetated to the extent feasible, as was done when mining in the Rouchleau Pit was completed. Cumulative Impacts/Mitigation The implementation of the US 53 project, combined with other past/future actions, could result in a cumulative reduction in vegetative cover in the project area over time. The planned projects would be expected to adhere to erosion control and vegetation management BMPs during construction in order to limit indirect impacts to vegetative cover and habitats, and with this mitigation, minor adverse cumulative impacts are anticipated. 7.2.3.10 Hazardous Materials Impacts of US 53 Alternatives Hazardous materials sites within 500 feet of any project alignment have been identified. Since no right-ofway acquisition is proposed for the No Build or Existing US 53 Alternatives, no hazardous materials impacts are anticipated. Right-of-way would be acquired for Alternatives M-1, E-1A, and E-2. A Phase II Environmental Site Assessment was completed for six sites; two, six, and four sites are within the estimated limits of construction for Alternatives M-1, E-1A, and E-2, respectively. Impacts of Past/Future Projects An assessment of hazardous materials would occur for land acquisition or disturbance as necessary for future projects. It is possible that hazardous materials may be encountered or that future projects would become generators of hazardous waste during construction or operation. Cumulative Impacts/Mitigation No cumulative impacts to hazardous waste sites are anticipated as a result of past, present, and future projects. For any project, proper agency coordination would take place to identify the appropriate plans and provisions necessary to handle known or unknown hazardous materials. A management plan would be developed for properly handling, treating, storing, and disposing of solid wastes, hazardous materials, petroleum products, and other regulated materials/wastes that are used or generated during construction. Any specific mitigation would be handled on a project-by-project basis. 8.0 Consultation and Coordination 8.1 Summary of Outreach During the Draft EIS Process This chapter summarizes outreach activities within the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) process. The function of the Project Advisory Committee (PAC), an overview of public meetings, and other elements of the Coordination Plan for Agency and Public Involvement are described. 8.1.1 Summary of the Scoping Process In order to inform the preparation of this Draft EIS, a Scoping process was used to identify the range of alternatives and impacts and significant issues to be addressed in the EIS, consistent with federal (40 CFR 1501.7 and 23 CFR 771.123(b)) and state (Minnesota Rules, section 4410.2100) requirements. For the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Scoping is normally achieved through public and agency involvement procedures outlined in 40 CFR 1501.7, including: ■ Identifying agencies with special interest or expertise and requesting their participation in the process as cooperating agencies: The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) have been identified as cooperating agencies for this project. Section 8.3.1 describes the cooperating agencies’ involvement. ■ Identifying other agencies or stakeholders that may be substantially affected by the proposed action/alternatives and soliciting their views regarding the range of alternatives and impacts and significant issues to be addressed in the EIS: This included involvement of participating agencies (see Section 8.3.1), environmental agencies (see Section 8.3.3), tribal coordination (see Section 8.3.3.3), and convening a Project Advisory Committee (PAC) for the project (see Section 8.2.1). ■ Determining the scope and significant issues to be analyzed in the EIS: Consistent with Minnesota environmental review requirements, a Scoping Document (SD)/Draft Scoping Decision Document (SDD) was prepared, and as part of this process the relative importance of social, economic, and environmental issues were assessed using data review and agency and stakeholder involvement. An environmental agency workshop was also held to gather input on resource management issues (see description in Section 8.3.3.1). Details of the issues identification process can be found in the SD/Draft SDD (February 2012).1 ■ Coordinating the preparation of the EIS with cooperating agencies: As described in the Coordination Plan for Agency and Public Involvement, the role of the cooperating agencies is to identify issues of concern regarding potential project impacts and provide meaningful input on the components of and analysis conducted for the EIS. ■ Identifying if there were other environmental assessments or EISs being prepared that were related to but not part of the scope of the US 53 project: None were identified. ■ Coordinating other environmental review and consultation requirements to be prepared concurrently and integrated with the EIS: The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT), FHWA, USEPA, and USACE have agreed to follow guidance that merges decision-making under NEPA and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (see Section 8.3.2). Other permits and approvals potentially required for the project were identified in the SD/Draft SDD (February 2012) and updated as necessary in the Draft EIS (see Section 8.3.4). ■ Preparing a schedule of key coordination/decision points and agency responsibilities for completing the EIS process: A detailed schedule of project milestones, coordination activities, and concurrence points is provided in the Coordination Plan for Agency and Public Involvement. ■ Public involvement/public hearing opportunities, including early and continued involvement and holding one or more public hearings: This included a public meeting early in the project development process (see Section 8.1.3.1), a Scoping public hearing (see Section 8.1.3.2), additional public meetings during an amended Scoping process (see Sections 8.1.3.3 and 8.1.3.4), as well as on-going “Coffee and Conversation” meetings (see Section 8.1.3.5). These agency/public involvement activities were used during Scoping to provide information and obtain input from the various project stakeholders regarding: ■ Project Purpose and Need: The Purpose and Need statement in Chapter 1: Purpose and Need of this Draft EIS was developed during the Scoping process, including stakeholder input. See Sections 8.1.3 and 8.2 for information on public meetings and agency coordination. ■ The range of alternatives being considered: The initial Scoping of alternatives in 2012-2013 is described in Section 2.1 of this Draft EIS, and the 2013 amended Scoping process is described in Section 2.2 of this Draft EIS. The development of alternatives and input on impacts and decision-making reflected input provided by project stakeholders (see Sections 8.1.3 and 8.2). ■ Anticipated social, economic, and environmental impacts of the alternatives and anticipated relative significance of issues to be addressed in the EIS: Input from cooperating agencies, other environmental regulatory agencies, and participating agencies was used to identify anticipated impacts and relative severity/importance to guide the issues to be addressed and the level of detail of analysis in the EIS. See Sections 8.1.3 and 8.2 for information on public meetings and agency coordination. 1 Available at http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/scoping.html The initial findings of the Scoping process were summarized in the February 2012 SD/Draft SDD which was distributed for public and agency review, consistent with Minnesota environmental review requirements, including holding the Scoping public hearing (March 2012). The comments received and responses to the comments are included in the September 2012 Final SDD, available on the project website.2 None of the 2012 public/agency comments required substantive changes to the initial Scoping findings/decisions. An initial assessment of Draft EIS alternatives was conducted, leading to re-Scoping of alternatives considered previously in an amended Scoping process (described in Section 2.2 of this Draft EIS), and ultimately resulting in one additional alternative being recommended for study in the Draft EIS. This process is documented in the September 2013 Amended SDD, available on the project website.3 8.1.2 Agency and Public Coordination Plan The purpose of the Coordination Plan for Agency and Public Involvement is to facilitate and document FHWA and MnDOT’s coordination with local government units, regulating agencies, and the public. The plan is also intended to inform these agencies and the public of how coordination will be accomplished throughout the project development process. The plan will be updated periodically during project development, as needed. 8.1.3 Public Meetings 8.1.3.1 Public Information Meeting (March 2011) A public information meeting was held on March 22, 2011, at the Community Center in Gilbert, Minnesota, from 2:30 to 7:00 p.m. A brief presentation was given at 3:00, 4:15, 5:30, and 6:30 p.m. Approximately 145 people signed in during the meeting. The focus of this meeting was to provide information on the study purpose, review the study process, highlight initial findings and environmental issues, and collect comments and feedback from the public. A brief summary of comments received at the meeting are provided below: 2 http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/scoping.html 3 http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/scoping.html ■ Limited support for the West Corridor alternatives for the following reasons: ■ Long reroute of traffic ■ Detrimental impacts to local business and access ■ Concern that removal of US 53 would disconnect the Quad Cities, where shared services such as emergency response and school district programming would encounter difficulties ■ Questions regarding feasibility of keeping US 53 on the current alignment ■ Concern about mine operations and future mining impact, including: ■ Potential for similar conflict between US 53 and mining operations in the future ■ Concerns about mining impacts on personal properties ■ Access to 2nd Avenue as a key corridor to downtown Virginia ■ City of Virginia drinking water supply from the Rouchleau Pit and potential water quality concerns about mining operations ■ Connectivity of US 53 and MN 135 8.1.3.2 Scoping Document Public Hearing (March 2012) A Scoping public hearing was held on March 27, 2012, at the Mountain Iron Community Center. The hearing was held from 4:00 to 8:00 p.m. with a presentation and opportunity for public questions and comments at 6:00 p.m. Approximately 75 people signed in for the hearing. Twenty-four comments were received at this meeting and were considered in finalizing the Scoping Decision Document. Seventeen comments were from the general public, three were from businesses, and four were from government agencies. 8.1.3.3 Public Open House (November 2012) A public open house meeting was held on November 15, 2012, at the Mountain Iron Community Center. The open house was held from 4:00 to 7:00 p.m. with MnDOT and project staff to answer questions oneon-one with attendees. Approximately 220 people signed in for the meeting. Thirty-two written comments were received at this meeting and were considered in preparation of the Draft EIS. The purpose of this meeting was to provide an update on the alternative details that had been developed as part of the on-going evaluation. Notifications for this meeting included newspaper notices (see Section 8.1.5 below), an announcement at the Virginia City Council meeting, information posted on the City of Virginia’s cable channel, flyers distributed in the Manney Shopper, and flyers dropped off at local convenience stores along 2nd Avenue in Virginia. Information was also distributed to the PAC two weeks prior to the open house. 8.1.3.4 Public Information Meeting (April 2013) A public information meeting was held on April 22, 2013, at the Mountain Iron Community Center. The meeting was held in open house format from 4:00 to 7:00 p.m. with MnDOT and project staff to answer questions one-on-one with attendees. Approximately 230 people signed in during the meeting. The focus of this meeting was to provide information on the need for additional alternatives to be evaluated (specifically a western alternative), review the revised schedule and study process, and collect comments and feedback from the public. The topics discussed included alternatives, the Scoping and EIS process, the project timeline, and general project cost concerns. Comments received at the meeting were similar to those previously provided, with a strong focus on reasons why the western alternative should remain dropped from further consideration. 8.1.3.5 Coffee and Conversation Meetings MnDOT has been holding Coffee and Conversation meetings (initially held biweekly, now monthly) at the MnDOT Virginia office since May 2013 to provide brief updates on the project and to allow for questions and answers from the public. The time and location of each meeting is announced on the MnDOT project website and at the preceding meeting. The Coffee and Conversation meetings are ongoing and will continue indefinitely as long as they are attended. Many of these meetings are taped and replayed on local Public Access Community Television (PACT). Examples of the meeting discussions include: ■ Addressing some of the concerns about Alternative M-1, the possibility of filling the Rouchleau Pit, and the general National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process and schedule for the project ■ Providing updates on recent activities and the status of the economic study ■ Addressing the issues that were being evaluated in the economic study, such as travel time calculations, vehicular user costs, emergency service and school bus costs, utilities coordination, and overall economic analysis ■ Presenting the results of the traffic analysis, stating that a four-lane configuration would likely be selected but that the traffic report is under review by FHWA ■ Presenting and discussing the E-1A alignment with the caveat that further engineering and geotechnical analysis is required before the alternative can be thoroughly vetted After it was determined that Alterative W-1A would not be carried forward into the Draft EIS, participation in these meetings dropped off and the frequency of the meetings was revised to monthly rather than biweekly. 8.1.3.6 Economic Study Meetings Meetings related to the economic study included a kickoff meeting on June 19, 2013, at the Mountain Iron Community Center and three business-specific economic study meetings for particular business groups on June 18, June 19, and June 20, 2013, at the Virginia Elks Club. The kickoff meeting outlined the scope, tasks, process, and schedule of the economic study and to discuss the objectives of the business group meetings. The input gained from these meetings has been documented in the Highway 53 Relocation Economic Impact Study (McComb Group and SEH, 2014). Results from the report were presented at the November 2013 Coffee and Conversation meeting. 8.1.4 Project Web Site A project webpage has been established as an additional means of distributing information about the project and is found at the following address: www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation. Information has also been provided to the Laurentian Chamber of Commerce for its website. 8.1.5 Notifications Notifications of public meetings are being published in the Mesabi Daily News and the Timberjay newspapers, both printed and distributed in Virginia and surrounding communities. Project status updates are being communicated to the general public by use of an automated email notification system made available to interested parties through the project web site. 8.2 Local Agency Coordination/Committees Coordination with local agencies and community members was important in identifying concerns, issues, and potential solutions. The PAC, convened by MnDOT specific to this project, served as the primary organization of community members for input and coordination. Outreach with other community organizations, such as the Laurentian Vision Partnership (LVP), was conducted on an as-requested basis with MnDOT representatives, providing information when requested. MnDOT also coordinated with various other agencies within Minnesota such as the local Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Lands and Minerals Office and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA). 8.2.1 Project Advisory Committee (PAC) The PAC represents local government units, regional agencies, and other community organizations and associations. This committee reviews and provides comments on the overall study. Invitations to participate on the PAC were extended to: ■ City of Virginia ■ City of Eveleth ■ City of Gilbert ■ City of Mountain Iron ■ St. Louis County ■ Clinton Township ■ Iron Range Resources Rehabilitation Board ■ Laurentian Chamber of Commerce ■ Cliffs Natural Resources (UTAC) ■ RGGS ■ Minnesota Department of Natural Resources ■ Minnesota Pollution Control Agency ■ Federal Highway Administration ■ Eveleth-Gilbert School District ■ Virginia School District ■ Eveleth Merchants Association ■ Iron Range Tourism Bureau PAC meetings were held in February 2011, June 2011, February 2012, November 2012, April 2013, June 2013, September 2013, and July 2014. Relevant project information, including the process and alternatives discussions, were covered during each of the PAC meetings. PAC members provided input to the project team (MnDOT and its consultants) regarding concerns within the alternatives and the project corridor. The PAC meetings kept the public and agency personnel informed of the status of the project and provided an opportunity for stakeholder input. 8.3 State and Federal Agency Coordination and Approvals 8.3.1 Cooperating and Participating Agencies Section 1305 of Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21) requires the lead agencies to establish a plan for coordinating public and agency involvement during the environmental review process. Applicable federal, state, regional, and local agencies were invited to be involved in the EIS process by becoming a cooperating or participating agency via an invitation letter issued February 12, 2011, and September 26, 2011, respectively. The Cities of Gilbert, Mountain Iron, Virginia, and Eveleth, as well as the DNR accepted (in writing) the invitation to be participating agencies.4 The following agencies were invited by FHWA, and have formally accepted, to be cooperating agencies5 for this project: ■ USACE ■ USEPA Cooperating agencies provide input related to relevant areas of expertise during the Scoping process and development of the EIS. These agencies also receive relevant technical studies and drafts of the Scoping Document and Scoping Decision Document, as well as the Draft and Final EISs. 8.3.2 NEPA/Section 404 Merger Concurrence Point Process In a process parallel to the cooperating agency approach described above, MnDOT, FHWA, USEPA, and USACE have also agreed to follow guidance that merges decision-making under NEPA and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The NEPA/Section 404 merger process recognizes that both NEPA and Section 404 review processes involve the evaluation of project purpose and need, the development of alternatives, the assessment of impacts, and the balancing/mitigation of impacts of a preferred alternative. The USACE, USEPA, and other involved agencies recognize the need to avoid duplication of these processes and to document progress. The Section 404 merger process is structured around four concurrence points with the NEPA process to establish progress on the above-noted steps. The four concurrence points are: 1) Purpose and Need, 2) alternatives to be carried forward into the Draft EIS for detailed study, 3) preferred alternative, and 4) mitigation of impacts.6 ■ Development of Purpose and Need (Concurrence Point #1): The Purpose and Need for the US 53 project was initially presented to interested environmental agencies at the June 29, 2011, agency workshop and in follow-up document reviews. Feedback from the workshop and following agency discussions was used to refine the Purpose and Need. FHWA and MnDOT requested specific input during the 30-day public review and comment period following publication of the SD/Draft SDD. USEPA and USACE gave their concurrence on Purpose and Need prior to publication of the Scoping Document (see Appendix C). ■ Identification of the range of Scoping alternatives (Concurrence Point #2): The initial range of Scoping alternatives was presented at the June 29, 2011, agency workshop. Feedback from the workshop and following agency discussions was used to refine the alternatives for presentation in the Scoping Document. FHWA and MnDOT requested specific input on the range of alternatives during the 30-day public review and comment period following publication of the SD/Draft SDD. The NEPA/Section 404 merger process concurrence point #2 occurred in the summer of 2012, during preparation of the Final SDD (see Appendix C). A cooperating agency update meeting was held to review the four alternatives that were identified through the Scoping process and additional alternatives evaluated in the amended Scoping process that would be evaluated during development of the Draft EIS. Thus, concurrence was updated as part of the Amended SDD (September 2013) with USEPA and USACE providing concurrence of the amended alternatives in September and October 2013 (see Appendix C). ■ Identification of the preferred alternative and the level of design detail (Concurrence Point #3): MnDOT has identified its preferred alternative and developed the rationale for selecting it. During the 4 Participating agencies are federal and non-federal governmental agencies that may have an interest in the project because of their jurisdictional authority, special expertise, and/or statewide interest. These participating agencies are formally invited to participate in the environmental review of the project. 5 A cooperating agency means any federal agency, other than a lead agency, that has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved in a proposed project or project alternative. 6 More on the NEPA/Section 404 merger process may be found at: http://environment.fhwa.dot.gov/projdev/tdmnepa404.asp official 45-day comment period on the Draft EIS, MnDOT and FHWA will request specific input from the cooperating agencies on the preferred alternative. Comments received on the Draft EIS will be shared with the participating agencies. The NEPA/Section 404 merger process concurrence point #3 will document agreement on the preferred alternative. ■ Completion of the Final EIS (Concurrence Point #4): The Final EIS and Record of Decision will document public and agency comments. The cooperating agencies, as part of the NEPA/Section 404 merger process concurrence point #4, will be requested to document agreement on measures to mitigate impacts due to the US 53 project. Written concurrence from both cooperating agencies has been received on the first two concurrence points (Purpose and Need – 2011/early 2012; alternatives to be carried forward – summer of 2012/updated fall of 2013). Concurrence on the preferred alternative will be requested following the Draft EIS public comment and response period. 8.3.3 Other Agency Coordination 8.3.3.1 Environmental Agency Workshops Certain project issues warrant input on a specialized basis. The study team held a workshop on June 29, 2011, for environmental agencies in the study area. This workshop was primarily a forum for interested agencies to review project Purpose and Need, provide input about resource management issues in the area, learn about and provide input regarding project alternatives development, and review project decision timeframes. A second environmental agency workshop was held on October 25, 2012. This workshop was used to update agencies on development of the Draft EIS, including alternatives refinement, preliminary findings from environmental studies, and key issues for completion of the Draft EIS. Ongoing coordination, as needed, has taken place with the USEPA and MPCA regarding air quality, the USACE regarding wetlands, the DNR regarding minerals and the Iron Range Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area (OHVRA), and the Quad Cities regarding economics, environmental justice, schools, emergency response providers, and other social and cultural issues. 8.3.3.2 Section 106 Consultation The Section 106 process7 consists of: ■ Steps for identifying and evaluating historic properties ■ Assessing the effects of a proposed project on historic properties ■ Consultation for methods to avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse effects The goal of the Section 106 process is to avoid adverse effects to historic properties. Where avoidance cannot be accomplished, measures to mitigate adverse effects are undertaken. Adverse effects occur when the project results in changes to the property, its setting, or its use that affect the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) characteristics of the property in a manner that diminishes the integrity of its location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, or association. Local governments are entitled to participate in the Section 106 process as consulting parties, along with the Minnesota State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), Native American tribes, and other interested organizations and individuals. Consulting parties are able to share their views, receive and review pertinent information, offer ideas, and consider possible solutions together with FHWA and other parties. Consulting parties play an important role in determining how potential effects on historic properties will be avoided or mitigated during the planning and implementation of a project. In the summer of 2011, letters were sent by the MnDOT Cultural Resources Unit (MnDOT CRU), on behalf of FHWA, extending invitations to each city in the corridor to participate in the Section 106 review process as a consulting 7 Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 party. Each city accepted and identified a contact person for the Section 106 process. If necessary, methods for avoidance, minimization, or mitigation of impacts to historic properties (any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or object included in or eligible for inclusion in the NRHP) would be developed with the three coordinating agencies under the Section 106 consultation process (FHWA, MnDOT CRU, and SHPO). MnDOT CRU is the FHWA designee for the Section 106 process. The Section 106 process looked at the identified buildings, structures, and known archaeological sites within the project’s area of potential effect (APE) that merit consideration as historic properties (one property determined eligible), and evaluated locations where the proposed project could have an adverse effect on historic properties. No impacts to historic properties have been identified as a result of this project. SHPO concurred with MnDOT CRU’s findings of no adverse effect for Alternatives M-1 and E-2 and the finding of no historic properties affected for Alternative E-1A, which concludes the Section 106 consultation process. See Appendix C for SHPO concurrence. 8.3.3.3 Tribal Consultation MnDOT CRU, on behalf of FHWA, sent coordination letters to Native American tribes that may have an interest in the US 53 project. The letter requested that tribes identify any historic, cultural, archaeological, or other concerns regarding the project and invited them to the upcoming public hearing for the Scoping Document. It also invited tribes to let FHWA know if they would prefer to schedule a separate meeting to discuss any specific tribal issues and concerns. One response, from the Bois Forte Band of Ojibwe, was received in January 2011 (Appendix C). No requests for separate meetings were made. 8.3.4 Permits and Approvals Permits and approvals that may be required for the proposed project are listed in Table 8.3-1. Table 8.3-1.

The Draft EIS was developed to comply with applicable state and federal regulations and acts as a public disclosure document by presenting the anticipated environmental consequences of each alternative with the possible reasonable and feasible mitigation measures. During the 45-day period, the document will be made available to interested and concerned parties including residents, property owners, community groups, the business community, elected officials, and public agencies. During this comment period, a public hearing will be held. The purpose of the hearing is to provide interested parties with information regarding project impacts of the alternatives studied in the Draft EIS and provide an opportunity to formally submit comments on the Draft EIS analysis. Specifically, MnDOT is looking for public comments on potential impact areas or other areas of concern not covered in the Draft EIS and additional information that could help refine the analysis. The anticipated schedule for this process is as follows (subject to revision): ■ Draft EIS published with a 45-day comment period – December 2014 ■ Draft EIS comment review, project refinement, and Final EIS preparation – spring 2015 ■ Final EIS/Record of Decision – fall 2015 9.0 Cost Analysis 9.1 Capital Costs 9.1.1 Capital Costs of Project Alternatives There are a number of factors that were included in developing a preliminary estimate of costs for the alternatives evaluated in this Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). These include estimates for: ■ Construction: includes preliminary estimates for mobilization, removals, excavation, materials (i.e., pavement, aggregate), traffic control/signing and striping, storm sewer and drainage, turf establishment and erosion control, bridges, culverts, retaining walls, noise walls, lighting, and traffic signals, and other miscellaneous construction costs. Also includes 12 percent for professional services necessary to complete construction. Construction costs were inflated to 2015 dollars to reflect anticipated year of construction. ■ Right-of-Way/Land/Mitigation: includes estimated right-of-way acquisition (permanent; greater than 99 years), relocation costs, air quality mitigation, mine operating expenses, mineral rights, and other compensation Estimates for unit costs were reviewed and evaluated based on identified risks for cost variation, and a Monte Carlo simulation1 was used to develop estimated cost ranges for each alternative based on these risks. Specific unit costs for ferrous and non-ferrous resources were not available at the time of this estimate and therefore were not specifically included; however, the cost ranges were set to cover a range of risks associated with these and other unknown costs and/or variability in cost factors. Preliminary cost ranges for each of the alternatives, separated into the construction and right-of-way/land/mitigation cost categories described above, are provided in Table 9.1-1. The ranges shown are for the purpose of comparing alternatives at an order-of-magnitude level and are based on concept-level footprints and information available at the time of Draft EIS preparation. Additional cost factors, such as operation and maintenance costs, have not been included in these estimates at this time. Refined cost information for the preferred alternative will be report in the Final EIS, as available. The ferrous and non-ferrous resource valuations are underway and will be used in right-of-way negotiations. This analysis will estimate value based on the amount and quality (level of oxidation) of ferrous resources present, as well as its accessibility/location. Samples are being evaluated for indicators of ferrous and non-ferrous resources and potential for these resources within the areas of evaluation for each alternative. Table 9.1-1. Range of Total Capital Costs for ConstructionA Alternative  Construction Cost  Right of Way/Land/ Mitigation Cost  Total Capital Costs for Construction  No Build Alternative  $1-2 million  $0  $1-2 million  Existing US 53 Alternative  $0  $400-600 million  $400-600 million  Alternative M-1  $235-350 million  $80-100 million  $315-450 million  Alternative E-1A RSS OptionB  $185-280 million  $10-20 million  $195-300 million  Alternative E-1A Bridge Option  $165-250  $10-20 million  $175-270 million  Alternative E-2 Straight Option  $165-215 million  $15-25 million  $180-240 million  Alternative E-2 Curved Setback Option  $165-215 million  $15-25 million  $180-240 million  A Based on 2014 dollars; construction costs inflated to 2015 dollars. Does not include costs for maintenance/operation. B Future mine access bridge anticipated to add approximately $12 million to the cost of the Alternative E-1A RSS Option (2015 dollars). 1 Monte Carlo simulation is a computerized mathematical technique that allows for risk in quantitative analysis and decision making to be taken into account. It furnishes the decision-maker with a range of possible outcomes and the probabilities they will occur for any choice of action. The descriptions of the alternatives below are provided to illustrate the assumed components for project alternatives as the basis for project cost estimates. Changes to the design assumptions may occur as more information becomes known and as higher levels of engineering design are undertaken. 9.1.1.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) The No Build Alternative would respond to the easement terms by closing the existing easement agreement area of US 53, resulting in traffic being rerouted to existing highways. Signage would be used to officially mark the rerouting of US 53, which would follow existing MN 37, Co. 7, and US 169. The No Build Alternative entails the removal work necessary to meet the US 53 roadway abandonment requirements, along with signage necessary to maintain connections between MN 135 and US 53 south of the mine property and between Virginia’s 2nd Avenue and US 53 north of the mining property. More specifically, the No Build Alternative estimate includes the following layout assumptions: ■ Removal of all US 53 roadway surfacing and bridge structures within the existing easement agreement area property except for a portion of northbound US 53 south of MN 135 which would be utilized for the US 53/MN 135 connection 9.1.1.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) The Existing US 53 Alternative seeks to maintain the existing US 53 corridor location, requiring the payment of mineral rights to the landowner, RGGS. Compensation to the mine would also be possible to mitigate the loss of tax revenue from the mine’s inability to expand. 9.1.1.3 Alternative M-1 Alternative M-1 would construct an embankment through the operating mine and utilize bridge structures at both the southern and northern ends of the mine crossing. The bridges would carry US 53 over the active mine pit, thereby providing opportunity for mining haul/transportation activities to cross beneath the roadway in a somewhat circular fashion. Embankment construction estimates through the mine area include costs for dynamic compaction at the existing surface level and the use of engineered fill slopes within the new embankments. The dynamic compaction would be utilized in an effort to consolidate the upper layer of the previously placed fills, and the engineered slopes allow for steeper side slopes on the new embankment, which allows for a reduced footprint within the mine. The potential effects of mine production blasting have been considered and may affect design of the embankment. The Alternative M-1 estimate includes the following general layout assumptions: ■ US 53 reconstruction length of approximately 21,250 feet ■ MN 135 access/connection is perpetuated through an at-grade signalized intersection ■ 2nd Avenue access is provided via a reconstructed segment of US 53 northbound, abandoned as a result of the realignment. Connection to US 53 is provided via an at-grade signalized intersection. ■ South bridge: three span, 670-foot long steel plate girder bridge. Center span to provide 120-foot vertical clearance for mine drill rig crossing. Center span also accommodates minimum 135-foot wide by 65-foot vertical opening to allow for mine haul truck crossing. ■ North bridge: three span, 395-foot long steel plate girder bridge. Center span accommodates minimum 135-foot wide by 65-foot vertical opening to allow for mine haul truck crossing. ■ Both bridges will be constructed in regions where mine fills have been placed. Due to settlement concerns, foundation piling estimates assume piling will need to penetrate through the fills and terminate at bedrock depth. ■ Embankment construction through the mine assumes: ■ In-place surface will be dynamically compacted prior to constructing embankments to attempt to control embankment settlement ■ New embankment (primarily between the two bridges) will be constructed as an engineered fill slope with 1:1 (vertical to horizontal) side slopes. Unreinforced fill will then be placed outside the 1:1 core to create a final embankment slope of 1:2. This additional side slope fill could provide protection to the reinforced core in instances of flyrock from mine blasting or other mine activities. The cost range in Table 9.1-1 includes the potential business risk mitigation cost range. As described in Section 4.2.4.2, in an effort to minimize risk to mine operations due to air quality concerns, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) investigated the potential to provide a physical barrier over the roadway for this alignment to prevent user exposure to potential PM10 exceedances from mine dust. This analysis is documented in two technical memorandums which can be reviewed on the project website.2 These memorandums include the Highway 53 M-1 Alignment Air Quality Mitigation Memo (CH2M Hill, 2013) and Structural Cost Estimate for Elevated Tunnel for US 53 Alternative M-1 Air Quality Mitigation (Kimley-Horn, 2013). Two tunnel options were considered, including construction of a three-sided concrete cover that in effect creates an elevated tunnel that US 53 would travel through. Option 1 spanned the full permit to mine limits (6,100 feet) to avoid any exposure within the permit area and to minimize the air handling equipment necessary. Option 2 shortened the length of tunnel to extend just beyond the potential exceedance area (3,000 feet) with air filtration to treat potential dust levels at the portals. The combined structure and air handling (including fire safety) equipment result in a cost range of $65 million to $130 million of construction costs for Alternative M-1, in addition to the roadway and rightof-way cost, pushing project costs well beyond current funding (Section 9.3). 9.1.1.4 Alternative E-1A Alternative E-1A routes to the east, avoiding the active UTAC mine; however, it would require construction within the Rouchleau Pit. Crossing of the pit would be accomplished by building on an existing submerged haul road embankment with an RSS fill or a bridge. The Alternative E-1A estimate includes the following layout assumptions: ■ US 53 reconstruction length of approximately 24,600 feet ■ Intersection Option: MN 135 access/connection is perpetuated through an at-grade, signalized intersection ■ Interchange Option: The additional cost to construct an interchange at MN 135/US 53 is estimated to be $4 million, excluding any additional right-of-way that may be needed. This estimate includes a compressed diamond configuration with one bridge, full access ramps, and a 25 percent contingency. ■ Access to 2nd Avenue is provided via an at-grade, signalized intersection ■ RSS Option: 2,800-foot long engineered fill slope to be constructed in drawdown, or wet condition (several options are being considered) ■ Bridge Option: 2,800-foot long bridge to be constructed across the pit. Costs for the Bridge Option are listed separately. In the future (estimated to be 30 years), construction of a mine access bridge on the east side of the pit to allow future mining access to the permit to mine area east of the new road alignment may be required. Cost estimates do not include construction of this future mine access bridge, which would add an estimated $12 million (2015 dollars) in cost to this alternative. 2 http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/TechnicalReports.html Separate cost estimates were also developed for two dewatering methods for the RSS Option, which include two of three of the dewatering routes evaluated. The first includes the option to transfer water from the initial drawdown of the Rouchleau Pit to the West Two Rivers Reservoir and discharge the maintenance dewatering system to the Enterprise Pit and Sauntry Creek. The second includes the option to transfer water from the initial drawdown of the Rouchleau Pit to Minntac Tailings Basin Cell 2, with maintenance dewatering discharged to the Enterprise Pit and Sauntry Creek. Cost estimates for both options include the set-up of two separate temporary pumping stations, pump rental, suction and discharge pipe rental, and diesel fuel costs. Mobilization for each option was estimated at four percent of construction costs. An additional 15 percent contingency was included in the preliminary design estimate to cover undeveloped design details. Costs for pump and pipeline monitoring for the duration of the dewatering operation were not included. It was assumed that the monitoring would be done by MnDOT staff. ■ West Two Rivers Reservoir/Enterprise Pit A preliminary opinion of probable costs for this option totals $13.7 million. Under this option, seven 4,500 gallons per minute (GPM) drawdown pumps (six operating and one spare) and three 4,500 GPM pumps (two operating and one spare) were included in the estimate. After the initial three-month drawdown period, the drawdown pumps would be taken out of service. A detailed breakdown of the costs is included in the TH 53 Relocation Alternative E-1A RSS Construction Option Water Management Study (HDR, 2014; provided in Appendix G). ■ Minntac Tailings Basin Cell 2/Enterprise Pit A preliminary opinion of probable costs for this option totals $21.6 million. This option includes the installation of seven drawdown pumps (six operating and one spare), six booster pumps (all operating), and three maintenance pumps (two operating and one spare). A detailed breakdown of the costs is included in the TH 53 Relocation Alternative E-1A RSS Construction Option Water Management Study (HDR, 2014; provided in Appendix G). 9.1.1.5 Alternative E-2 Alternative E-2 routes to the east, avoiding the active UTAC mine boundary; however, it would require construction through the Rouchleau Pit. The Rouchleau Pit crossing is accommodated by a bridge structure. The bridge structure would cross between the east and west sides of the pit with abutments built high atop the presumed bedrock ridges at each side. For intermediate support within the 1,350-foot bridge length, three tall support piers ranging in height from 200 to 250 feet would extend down to pile supported foundations built at approximately the existing water level elevation. The Alternative E-2 estimate includes the following layout assumptions for both the Straight Option and the Curved Setback Option: ■ US 53 reconstruction length of approximately 20,500 feet ■ Intersection Option: MN 135 access/connection is perpetuated through an at-grade, signalized intersection ■ Interchange Option: The additional cost to construct an interchange at MN 135/US 53 is estimated to be $4 million, excluding any additional right-of-way that may be needed. This estimate includes a compressed diamond configuration with one bridge, full access ramps, and a 25 percent contingency. The location of this interchange requires substantially more earthwork than under the Intersection Option. ■ Access to 2nd Avenue is provided via an at-grade, signalized intersection ■ Single, four span, 1,350-foot long steel plate girder bridge ■ Bridge crosses over the existing Rouchleau Pit ■ Extent of mined fill placed over bedrock within the pit is unknown. For determination of foundation piling lengths, estimate assumes a bedrock elevation at approximately 1,200 feet. 9.2 Benefit-Cost As required by the State of Minnesota, a benefit-cost analysis is prepared for any trunk highway construction project greater than $10 million (Laws of Minnesota 2001, chapter 10, article 2, section 41). The proposed Build Alternatives for this project have been estimated to cost more than $10 million, and the benefit-cost analysis for the project is based on determining the present value of all benefits and costs associated with each of the Build Alternatives compared to the No Build Alternative. The purpose of a benefit-cost analysis is to express the effects of an investment (or closure) into a common measure (dollars). This allows for the fact that the benefits or costs of a project are often accrued over a long period of time, while the initial investment is incurred during the initial years of the project. In this analysis approach, any quantified benefits that are greater than or equal to the quantified costs (benefit-to-cost ratio greater than one) represents an economically viable project. 9.2.1 Methodology and Assumptions The monetary benefit for the project is quantified in terms of reduced vehicle miles traveled (VMT), vehicle hours traveled (VHT), and estimated crashes over the analysis period between the No Build Alternative and the Build Alternatives. The costs typically include construction, bridges and structures, right-of-way, and engineering/project delivery costs. Remaining capital values of these roadway features at the end of the analysis period are subtracted from the total cost of the project. The results of the analysis provide input for evaluating the overall benefit of the proposed improvements to the corridor. Due to the planning level of detail in the calculations, the magnitude of the benefit-to-cost ratio is not as important as the value being greater or less than one. 9.2.1.1 General Assumptions ■ All monetary values were discounted to the 2014 analysis year. Inflation was not included. ■ The 20-year benefit period was based on a 2017 day-of-opening (or closure) through 2037 ■ The No Build Alternative included a change between 2023 and 2024. At that time, Co. 101 was assumed closed, changing traffic routing patterns through the year 2037. ■ Yearly Build and No Build benefits were calculated based on linear interpolation over the 20-year analysis period ■ The No Build Alternative assumed two linear interpolations, one from 2017 to 2023, then from 2024 to 2037 ■ The number of days per year used in the analysis was 365.25. This is based on the roadway closure and rerouting affecting all traffic every day of the year. ■ Longer travel times and rerouting of trips during construction years were not included ■ Preliminary costs estimates were completed using MnDOT methodology. The cost estimates were based on documented construction costs. The cost estimates included all roadway sections including local street connections due to access changes. ■ Estimated costs for right-of-way and mineral rights were included in the total capital cost for construction (see Table 9.1-1) ■ Operating and maintenance (O&M) values were estimated based on MnDOT guidance from both the Office of Capital Programs and Performance Measures and District 1 staff ■ The No Build and Build Alternatives have very similar roadway networks that would incur the same O&M costs. Therefore, only the change in roadway length was used in the calculations. Since the No Build Alternative removes roadway, it had a baseline value of 0. ■ Yearly bridge inspection and maintenance estimated at $0.35 per square foot (value provided by MnDOT) ■ Roadway improvements possibly needed due to the increased traffic demands on existing routes in the No Build Alternative were not considered at this time ■ Yearly intersection crashes and crash benefits were calculated for all alternatives. A crash history was obtained from the Traffic Analysis Technical Report (CH2M Hill, 2013) that included crashes along all roadway segments between 2007 and 2011. ■ VMT and VHT values used were based on data provided in the Highway 53 Relocation Economic Impact Study (McComb Group and SEH, 2014) Table 9.1-2. Benefit-Cost Results Alternative  Benefit Cost Ratio  No Build Alternative  0  Existing US 53 Alternative  4.8  Alternative M-1  2.8  Alternative E-1A RSS Option  4.2  Alternative E-1A Bridge Option  5.0  Alternative E-2  5.8  Preliminary analysis indicates that all of the Build Alternatives have a benefit-cost ratio greater than 1.0, meaning the VMT, VHT, and crash reduction benefits of the project are estimated to be greater than the costs associated with the construction of the project. Alternative E-2 has the highest ratio at 5.8; the Alternative E-1A Bridge Option has the second highest ratio at 5.0. The Existing US 53 Alternative and the Alternative E-1A RSS Option both are above 4.0 with ratios of 4.8 and 4.2, respectively. At this level of analysis, the magnitude of the benefit-cost ratio is not as important as the overall finding that the ratio is greater than one. Further refinements to the VMT and VHT values are possible using different traffic models and methods. However, this basic analysis indicates that the Existing US 53 Alternative and all of the Build Alternatives are economically valuable. 9.3 Project Delivery Method MnDOT is using the Construction Manager/General Contractor (CMGC) project delivery method for roadway construction for this project. This is one of four general project delivery methods: design-bidbuild,3 design-build,4 public-private partnership,5 and CMGC. 3 Design-bid-build is a traditional and well-known method of project delivery. It splits the design and construction activities of a particular project, with potentially separate entities completing the work under separate contracts. Activities occur in a sequential manner (i.e., preliminary design is completed before final design begins), and all design is completed prior to beginning construction. This often takes a longer time to complete than design-build but is thought to offer a more competitive bidding and offers the owner significant control over the end product. 4 Design-build is a method of project delivery in which one design-build team works under a single contract with the project owner to provide design and construction services. The owner has a single point of contact with the team and does not have to be involved in management of multiple firms. Activities overlap, and construction begins before final design is complete. This can save time in the schedule and allow for more collaboration between design and construction but also may introduce additional risks. CMGC project delivery allows an owner (MnDOT) to engage a construction manager during the design process to provide constructability input. The CMGC contracting method offers benefits to MnDOT in terms of innovation, value, and speed. The CMGC construction manager is generally selected on the basis of qualifications, past experience, or best value. During the design phase, the construction manager provides input regarding scheduling, pricing, phasing, and other factors that helps the owner design a more constructible project. At approximately an average of 60 percent to 90 percent design completion, the owner and the construction manager negotiate a “guaranteed maximum price” for the construction of the project based on the defined scope and schedule. If this price is within 10 percent of an independent estimate, a contract is executed for construction services, and the construction manager becomes the general contractor.6 If the price is not within 10 percent, MnDOT prepares a variance report and tries to reconcile differences in pricing assumptions for items of work that differ by more than 10 percent. If reconciliation is possible, changes to the cost model and baseline schedule are made. If reconciliation is not possible, the CMGC contract could be terminated and the project procured through another method, or management could be consulted on the option to award the contract. Although the CMGC construction manager’s scope of work includes providing technical assistance during the NEPA process, the construction manager does not have any role in the preparation of NEPA documentation or any decision-making responsibility with respect to the NEPA process. The CMGC contract includes appropriate provisions ensuring that no commitments are made to any alternative being evaluated in the NEPA process and that the comparative merits of all alternatives presented in the NEPA document, including the No Build Alternative, are evaluated and fairly considered. The CMGC contract includes appropriate provisions ensuring that all environmental and mitigation measures identified in the NEPA document are implemented. MnDOT has been moving forward with preliminary design plans for the Build Alternatives concurrent with preparation and public release of the Draft EIS in an effort to better define the design details, right-of-way needs, etc., to inform the selection of a preferred alternative and help to minimize schedule delays given the time constraint the project is under to vacate the existing easement agreement area. MnDOT will use a “green sheet” tracking system to document and manage all environmental and design commitments made for the US 53 project through the EIS and permit review process. The green sheet will be developed for the preferred alternative and included in the Final EIS. 9.4 Available Funding 9.4.1 Estimate of Cost The estimated total project cost of the preferred alternative (in 2015 dollars) is $180 to $240 million. 9.4.2 Anticipated Funding The funds allocated for the proposed project (SP 6918-80 and associated projects) are a combination of federal and state funds. ■ Federal: $30 million (National Highway Performance Program – NHPP) ■ State Trunk Highway Bonds: $34 million (Chapter 152) MnDOT currently has $30 million in federal funds and $34 million in state bonds shown for preliminary engineering and initial construction in the approved Fiscal Year 2015-2018 State Transportation 5 Public-private partnerships are contractual agreements formed between a public agency and a private sector entity that allow for greater private sector participation in the delivery and financing of transportation projects. This delivery method can bring creativity, efficiency, and financial capital to address complex transportation problems facing state and local governments but requires careful assessment of risks and long-term management of the resource. 6 http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/construction/cqit/cm.cfm Improvement Program (STIP). These funds will be used both for preliminary engineering and for actual construction. At present there is a gap between the identified funding and the range for the total project cost ($240 million for the preferred alternative). Since maintaining this connection is critical to the state of Minnesota it is likely that the funding gap may be addressed through legislation in the upcoming 2015 legislative session beginning January 6, 2015. Without legislative action the funding gap would be addressed through major changes to the existing program, resulting in MnDOT’s failure to meet performance outcomes identified in the Minnesota State Highway Investment Plan (MnSHIP),7 or accepting the No Build Alternative for this project. The gap between the funding dedicated to the project as programmed in the current STIP and what it would take to build the preferred alternative would have to be programmed in an approved STIP before the lead federal agency (FHWA) could issue a Record of Decision for this project. 7 Available at http://www.dot.state.mn.us/planning/mnship/pdf/mnship-full-doc.pdf 10.0 Comparison of Alternatives This chapter compares the No Build, Existing US 53, M-1, E-1A, and E-2 Alternatives considered for the US 53 project based on the information presented in previous chapters of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and other supporting documents. The comparison also includes the Alternative E-1A RSS Option and Bridge Option, the Alterative E-1A Intersection Option and Interchange Option, the Alternative E-2 Straight Option and Curved Setback Option, and the Alternative E-2 Intersection Option and Interchange Option. The purpose of this chapter is to compare the benefits and environmental consequences of each alternative against the project’s goals and objectives to inform the decision process for the identification of the preferred alternative. 10.1 Comparison Framework 10.1.1 Purpose and Need, Goals, and Objectives The need for undertaking this project is derived from the following transportation system needs: ■ Respond to the roadway easement terms; address the requirements set forth in agreements between the State of Minnesota and the land owner ■ Provide a facility that meets regional and inter-regional system connectivity needs and inter-regional highway corridor performance targets ■ Maintain local connectivity to the regional system and maintain efficiency of local connections ■ Provide a facility that serves current and future capacity needs, while maintaining system mobility and safety 10.1.2 Evaluation Methodology The evaluation methodology used for this comparison of alternatives is similar to the methods used during the Scoping process (see discussion in Chapter 2: Alternatives). This involved a two-part process, which first compared the alternatives to the project’s stated purpose and need goals, and second, compared the environmental impacts among the alternatives. If there is an obvious alternative that clearly meets the stated needs and has fewer/less severe environmental impacts, it is typically identified as the preferred alternative. In the event there are multiple alternatives that meet the project needs, and/or the alternatives have environmental impacts but to different resources, comparison of alternatives and selection of a preferred alternative becomes more complex, requiring additional technical information to be considered in the selection, yet continues to weigh the project needs against the potential environmental impacts of each alternative. 10.2 Comparison Results 10.2.1 Comparison to Project Purpose and Need The performance of the Draft EIS alternatives were compared based upon the project need criteria listed in Section 10.1.1. The results are reported in Table 10.2-1. It is noted that even though the Existing US 53 Alternative does not technically honor the terms of the easement agreement by not vacating the easement, it provides the mineral rights owner and landowner fair compensation for the land and minerals, which was assumed for purposes of this analysis as an alternate method of meeting the agreement conditions. Additionally, while all of the Build Alternatives technically would meet the project need to honor the requirement to vacate the existing easement agreement area, Alternatives M-1 and E-1A have high risk for not being able to meet the required May 2017 closure date. Alternative E-2 has the lowest schedule risk based on construction needs. 10.2.2 Summary of Social, Environmental and Economic Impacts This Draft EIS has described the transportation, social, natural, and physical environmental impacts associated with the construction and operation of the US 53 Virginia to Eveleth project. The effects of the No Build, Existing US 53, M-1, E-1A, and E-2 Alternatives, including options, were evaluated and compared across a range of subject areas related to the built and natural environment. The Existing US 53 Alternative essentially resulted in no impacts except right-of-way and economic/business impacts, which are summarized in the following paragraph. A summary of impacts from the other alternatives is provided in Table 10.2-2. The Existing US 53 Alternative requires the fee acquisition of 77 acres of land to maintain the existing easement agreement area, including mineral rights. The mitigation to the landowner is fair compensation under the Uniform Relocation Act. Encumbering the ferrous resources in this area also requires potential compensation for impacts to the mine operator for lost production. These expenditures would be considered a long-term investment but an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of financial resources. The total capital cost of construction is estimated to be $400-600 million. Table 10.2-1.

Blasting may be required for each Build Alternative, which could result in some additional temporary road closures  Vibrations  similar to those experienced for mine blasting. However, much of the construction for the Build Alternatives is on new alignments and can be constructed with minimal disruption to current US 53 travelers. Blasting, when needed, will be scheduled for minimal disruption.  Stormwater  Impact: Potential for erosion during existing US 53 roadway removal Mitigation: NPDES Stormwater permit for construction activity, including BMPs, temporary construction measures, and erosion control plan, would be acquired and complied with throughout construction. After construction, all disturbed areas would be sodded or seeded.

After construction, all disturbed areas would be sodded or seeded.  Water Supply/  No impact  Impact: Potential for construction dewatering/appropriation for Rouchleau Pit activities for Alternatives E-1A and E-2  Water Body  Mitigation: NPDES Stormwater permit for construction activity, including BMPs, temporary construction measures, and erosion control plan, would be acquired and  Modification  complied with throughout construction. DNR water appropriation permit may identify mitigation measures. Dewatering discharge options would be considered water transfers to waters of the state and would not be subject to MPCA water quality permitting, provided that there is no intervening use of the water and no pollutants are introduced.  Short-Term Use and Long-Term Productivity  Substantial long-term transportation inefficiencies  The long-term transportation service and efficiency benefits of the Build and Existing US 53 Alternatives would outweigh short-term adverse impacts to the physical/natural environment. Short-term impacts to the natural environment would be mitigated to alleviate long-term consequences. Would result in the short-term use of resources, but short-term use of these resources is consistent with long-term productivity of the area  Irreversible and Irretrievable  Increased energy consumption and financial resources for travelers and communities due to increased travel time  One-time expenditure of irretrievable state and federal funds, considered long-term investment; land used for the project is considered an irreversible commitment during the time period that the land is used for a highway facility  Total Capital Costs for  $1-2 million  $315-450 million  Intersection Option: $195-300 million  Intersection Option: $175-270 million  Intersection Option (with Straight  Construction  Interchange Option: Additional cost of $4 million  Interchange Option: Additional cost of $4 million  Option and Curved Setback Option): $180-240 million Interchange Option (with Straight Option and Curved Setback Option): Additional cost of $4 million  10.3 Selection of a Preferred Alternative Based on the analysis conducted for and presented in this Draft EIS, MnDOT has identified a preferred alternative: Alternative E-2. Each alternative evaluated had unique and challenging issues and a combination of impacts. A description of the rationale used to reach this conclusion is outlined below for each alternative, starting with the preferred alternative. 10.3.1 Preferred Alternative Alternative E-2 includes a 1,300-foot long bridge with 180-foot or taller bridge piers within the Rouchleau Pit. It is recommended as the preferred alternative based on its ability to meet the project Purpose and Need and minimize impacts to social, economic, and environmental resources, and on the basis of a number of technical and cost considerations, as described below. Both the Straight Option and Curved Setback Option are being carried forward with the preferred alternative for further refinement; however, one will be identified as the selected option in the Final EIS based on public and agency comment, refinement of the design, and overall environmental impacts. MN 135 and US 53 are currently connected via an interchange. The Highway Safety Manual (HSM) was used to compare crash rates for the Intersection and Interchange Options. The results were essentially the same for the two options at the level of the HSM analysis for the years 2009, 2017, and 2037. Both options have similar levels of service with the exception of the southbound movement in the PM peak hour for the Intersection Option. While the results were essentially the same between the Intersection Option and Interchange Option at the level of the HSM analysis for the years 2009, 2017, and 2037, this analysis does not account for the grade difference for the east approach between these options. With the Interchange Option, the grade of MN 135 from the east can be reduced from six percent to two percent as compared to the Intersection Option. The Intersection Option would require a much steeper grade (six percent) at the east approach, which would be expected to result in increased difficulty for loaded semi-trucks turning left onto US 53 in the winter (November to April). This difficulty would increase the potential for semi-truck/vehicle conflict at the intersection, which could increase crash risk and result in the intersection being the less desirable option based on safety. This reduction in grade would also reduce the earthwork and rock cut quantities required for construction. Maintenance of existing access and minimizing delays at US 53 and MN 135 has been strongly supported by the public during public meetings. Therefore, the Interchange Option was selected for the preferred alternative over the Intersection Option.  Benefits of the preferred alternative include: ■ Mineral Rights: Avoids the permit to mine/environmental setting boundary ■ Business Risks: Has no risk for air quality compliance to impact mine operations ■ Water Supply: Avoids the major dewatering that would be required for the Alternative E-1 RSS Option ■ Wetlands: Both the Straight and Curved Setback Options have fewer wetland impacts than Alternative E-1A (RSS or Bridge Option). The Straight Option has fewer wetland impacts than Alternative M-1, and the Curved Setback Option has wetland impacts similar to Alternative M-1. ■ Noise: A noise wall is preliminarily cost effective at affected residential locations ■ Right-of-Way: Impacts the fewest number of parcels of any Build Alternative ■ Engineering and Constructability Considerations: ■ Shorter bridge than the Alternative E-1A Bridge Option ■ Only two pier foundations required, compared to up to eight for the Alternative E-1A Bridge Option ■ Less work required to construct in the water/ice of the Rouchleau Pit ■ Avoids 40 mph curve needed for Alternative E-1A ■ Has a better sight distance northbound from the bridge to the 2nd Avenue traffic signal than Alternative E-1A ■ Piers to be constructed in less than 30 feet of mine waste fill as compared to Alternative E-1A that would have up to 100 feet of mine waste fill ■ Schedule: Has the least schedule risk due to engineering constructability considerations noted above as well as considerations related to owner and operator property interests ■ Cost: Costs significantly less than the Existing US 53 Alternative and Alternative M-1, and the upper range of the cost estimate is less than that for either the Alternative E-1A RSS Option or Bridge Option The negative effects of this alternative include: ■ Mineral Rights: More mineral encumbrance than Alternative E-1A; requires greater impact to School Trust land and, therefore, has potential for greater impact to Vermillion Gold, Inc.’s lease than Alternative E-1A ■ Section 4(f): Impacts the OHVRA; however, the impact is negligible and meets the definition of de minimis ■ Vegetation/Cover Types: Impacts more acres of forest than other alternatives; however, impacts to wildlife are negligible ■ Unknowns: Requires additional geotechnical characterization at pier locations 10.3.2 Rationale for Rejecting Other Alternatives The following describes the factors considered for each of the remaining alternatives and the rationale for why they were not selected for this project. 10.3.2.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) Similar to the dismissed Alternative W-1A (2013 Amended Scoping Decision Document), the No Build Alternative was not identified as the preferred alternative for several reasons. While it avoids water quality, wetland, mineral resource, and noise impacts associated with the Build Alternatives, it only meets one of the four project needs; therefore, it does not meet the overall need for the project. In addition, it would have substantial economic impacts resulting from increased travel times between the cities of Eveleth, Gilbert, and Virginia; would cause high levels of traffic congestion; and would be expected to result in substantial local and political opposition due to creating greater economic and local impacts than the western alternative (Alternative W-1A) that was dismissed during Scoping. The only benefit of this alternative was that it would avoid crossing the Biwabik Iron Formation, thus keeping mineral rights as a non-issue. The No Build Alternative was carried forward for analysis as the “do nothing alternative” because it was required for comparison to other alternatives. It is not identified as the preferred alternative since other Build Alternatives (i.e., M-1, E-1A, and E-2) would meet all of the identified project needs with less severe social, economic, and environmental impacts. 10.3.2.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) Keeping the highway open in its current location would require condemnation by the State of Minnesota to oppose termination of the existing easement agreement knowing that the owner and lessee are not willing sellers. Even with the use of eminent domain, this alternative may require a large payment from the State to the owners and operators of the minerals and mining/lease rights (RGGS and UTAC). The benefits of this alternative include eliminating the need for new construction or realignment, which would result in no impacts to environmental resources. The negative effects of this alternative would include: ■ Mineral Rights: Uncertainty of ferrous resource quantity and estimated value which has substantial impact on project costs; eminent domain/negotiation process would be required ■ Economic: Effect of potential business impacts on local economy ■ Schedule: The uncertain effect of the eminent domain process (potential for litigation resulting from eminent domain action) on project schedule ■ Cost: The long term effect on state transportation budgets over the next several years due to high cost to acquire mineral rights Because the Existing US 53 Alternative would have substantially greater cost than any of the Build Alternatives, without addressing schedule and economic impacts, it was not selected as the preferred alternative. 10.3.2.3 Alternative M-1 Alternative M-1 would be routed through the active UTAC mine with approximately one mile of new four-lane roadway constructed to mostly follow the grade created by the partially-backfilled Auburn Pit. Benefits of this alternative include: ■ Access: Shortest alternative with most direct realignment ■ Right-of-Way: Requires fewer acres of right-of-way acquisition than the other Build Alternatives ■ Mineral Rights: Follows a narrow corridor identified by mine operator as being mostly depleted of ferrous resources ■ Section 4(f): Avoids impacts to the OHVRA ■ Wetlands: Would have less wetland impact than Alternative E-1A ■ Water Supply/Water Quality: Avoids impacts associated with crossing the Rouchleau Pit ■ Vegetation/Cover Types: Impacts fewer acres of forest than the other Build Alternatives The negative effects of this alternative include: ■ Mineral Rights: The footprint of the road and setbacks would prohibit mining within a 1,200-foot wide swath through the mine, encumbering more ferrous resources than expected due to mining setbacks ■ Business Risk: Greatest business risk impact due to potential conflicts with existing and future mine air quality permit compliance. Mitigation measures to avoid such conflicts were investigated but could not be assured to avoid such risks to the operator. The mitigation cost would be substantial ($65 to 130 million). ■ Wetlands: Greater impacts to wetlands than the Alternative E-2 Curved Setback Option ■ Noise: A noise wall is preliminarily cost effective at only one of the three affected residential locations ■ Engineering and Constructability Considerations: ■ Foundation Concerns: Constructability of RSS fill and/or bridge piers through more than 100 feet of unstable mine waste fill is feasible but at substantial cost to design and construct ■ Constructability: Construction in an active mine (frequent delays while mine blasting) would be costly, especially under an expedited schedule. Contractors would need to be certified/trained to work in the mine. ■ Schedule: Construction methods and practices needed to address unstable fill, frequent blasting shutdowns, and road height; it is unlikely this alternative can be constructed in two construction seasons ■ Costs: Uncertainty of ferrous resource quantity and estimated value has substantial impact on project costs. MnDOT core samples indicate less ferrous resources here than the existing easement agreement area. Because Alternative M-1 has feasibility issues and would result in severe negative impacts that are not offset by the benefits in minimization, it was not identified as the preferred alternative. 10.3.2.4 Alternative E-1A RSS Option The Alternative E-1A RSS Option is one of the two options considered for Alternative E-1A. Initially, a fill option was thought to provide a less expensive option than building a long bridge. However, as geotechnical issues were investigated, greater risks were identified, increasing the costs for construction. Benefits of this option include: ■ Does not initially require a bridge but may include a future bridge to allow future mine operations to pass under the roadway The negative effects of this option include: ■ Right-of-Way: The required seismic setback is 400 feet greater than the Bridge Option, resulting in the need for more right-of-way and greater impact to future mining operations ■ Business Risk: The RSS Option poses moderate business risk compared to low risk from the Alternative E-1A Bridge Option ■ Water Supply: Involves potential drawdown of the Rouchleau Pit and Enterprise Pit, with dewatering discharge conveyed to receiving waters outside the project ■ Wetlands: The Alternative E-1A RSS and Bridge Options impact the greatest number of wetland acres ■ Other Environmental Impacts: Social and physical impacts of this option are similar to that of the Bridge Option except for business risk and dewatering impacts which are greater for the RSS Option ■ Engineering and Constructability Considerations: The RSS Option poses a number of risks associated with uncertainty related to geotechnical issues as discussed in Section 5.14.2.4. The embankment would be the highest MnDOT has ever built, approximately 160 feet tall. This embankment would be constructed on top of mine waste fill that is currently under approximately 30 feet of water. The embankment would also be subjected to seismic forces due to future mining operations. Concerns include the stability of the embankment and the potential for settlement. As soil borings and test pits indicate that virtually none of the materials from the planned excavations would meet the graduation requirements of the RSS embankment, the earthwork would involve millions of yards of borrow and excess material. ■ Schedule: Requires greatest construction effort while unlikely to meet timeline due to dewatering, with substantial risks for additional delays due to weather, mine waste fill, and design requirements to mitigate constructability concerns. ■ Cost: The RSS Option is estimated to cost $20-31 million more than the Bridge Option. The measures required to mitigate the uncertainly are extensive, including time-consuming and costly pumping to lower the water level below the top of the existing fill, removing existing trees and debris, dynamically compacting the surface of the existing fill, constructing a reinforced steepened slope to the desired grade, and instrumenting the embankment to provide warnings in the event the slope moves. Because the Alternative E-1A RSS Option has feasibility issues and would result in severe schedule and constructability impacts that are not offset by the benefits in minimization of environmental impacts, it was not identified as the preferred alternative. Bridge Option This alternative includes a 2,800-foot long bridge with 150-foot or taller bridge piers within the Rouchleau Pit. Benefits of this alternative include: ■ Mineral Rights: Lowest ferrous and non-ferrous resource encumbrance expected of all alternatives ■ Schedule: Major dewatering not required, unlike for the RSS Option ■ Cost: The Bridge Option would cost less than the RSS Option but potentially more than Alternative E-2 The negative effects of this alternative include: ■ Right-of-Way: Impacts the most parcels of any of the Build Alternatives ■ Business Risk: The Bridge Option poses moderate business risk compared to low risk from Alternative E-2 ■ Section 4(f): Impacts the OHVRA; however, the impact is negligible and meets the definition of de minimis ■ Wetlands: The Alternative E-1A RSS and Bridge Options impact the greatest number of wetland acres ■ Noise: A noise wall is preliminarily cost effective at only one of the three affected residential locations ■ Vegetation/Cover Types: Impacts more acres of forest than Alternative M-1; however, impacts to wildlife are negligible ■ Environmental Impacts: Social and physical impacts of this option are similar to that of the RSS Option except for business risk and dewatering impacts which are greater for the RSS Option. ■ Constructability: This option requires the longest bridge of any of the Build Alternatives. It poses a number of risks associated with uncertainty related to geotechnical issues as discussed in Section 5.14.2.4. The bridge would be one of the highest MnDOT has ever built, up to 200 feet tall. Bridge piers would be constructed on top of mine waste fill that is 30 to 100 feet thick and is currently under approximately 30 feet of water. The bridge would also be subjected to seismic forces due to future mining operations. Concerns include the stability of the bridge piers and the potential for settlement. ■ Schedule: Requires greatest construction effort to meet timeline, with substantial risks for delays due to weather, mine waste fill, and design requirements to mitigate constructability concerns. Because the Alternative E-1A Bridge Option has feasibility issues and would result in severe negative schedule impacts that are not offset by the benefits in minimization of environmental impacts, it was not identified as the preferred alternative. 10.3.3 EIS Review Process and Schedule As required by the federal and state environmental review process, copies of the Draft EIS will be distributed to appropriate local, regional, state, and federal agencies as well as the public for their review and comment. Public comment on the content of the Draft EIS and the identified preferred alternative will be taken into account in the preparation of the Final EIS and Record of Decision (ROD). The anticipated schedule for this process is as follows (subject to revision): ■ Draft EIS published with a 45-day comment period – December 2014 ■ Final EIS and Record of Decision – fall 2015 US Highway 53 Virginia to Eveleth STATE PROJECT SP 6918-80 DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT DECEMBER 2014 Abstract This Draft Environmental Impact Statement (Draft EIS) describes the transportation and environmental impacts associated with the termination of easement rights for a one and a half mile segment of the US 53 corridor where it crosses the United Taconite open-pit mine between Virginia and Eveleth, Minnesota. On May 5, 2010, United Taconite (UTAC) and RGGS provided notice to the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) that the 1960 easement rights would be terminated. Under the original easement terms, MnDOT must vacate the US 53 easement within three years of notification. In response to the notice, MnDOT requested a seven-year timeframe for relocation of US 53. The two parties have signed an agreement to modify the easement vacation date to May 2017. MnDOT is conducting this project process to make decisions on how to best address the pending termination of easement rights. The project is located within the Mesabi Range of the “Iron Range” of northeastern Minnesota and is set in the middle of the Quad Cities area, which includes the cities of Eveleth, Gilbert, Mountain Iron, and Virginia. This segment of US 53 is an important local and interregional transportation connection. The land use characteristics within the project area consist of large mining operations, forested land, wetlands, open space, residential areas, and commercial developments. Five potential alignments are evaluated in this Draft EIS: No Build Alternative, Existing US 53 Alternative, Alternative M-1, Alternative E-1A, and Alternative E-2. All potentially significant environmental, social, economic, and transportation benefits and impacts of the proposed alternatives are evaluated in the Draft EIS. Documentation regarding Section 4(f) recreational resource impacts is also included.  Table of Contents Executive Summary .......................................................................................................................................

This roughly one and a half-mile segment of US 53, from approximately 2nd Avenue West to Cuyuna Drive in Virginia, Minnesota, is subject to iron ore mining rights held by RGGS and Cliffs Natural Resources (United Taconite Division, herein referred to as UTAC), the mine’s owner and operator, respectively. At its east end, the US 53 easement segment connects with Minnesota Trunk Highway 135 (MN 135), which provides the inter-regional link toward Gilbert and other communities to the east. Under the 1960 easement terms, MnDOT agreed to relocate US 53 upon notice from the mine owner/operator. On May 5, 2010, UTAC1 and RGGS provided notice to MnDOT that the 1960 easement rights would be terminated (see copies of the 1960 easement and the letter of termination in Appendix A). Under the original easement terms, MnDOT must vacate the US 53 easement within three years of notification. In response to the notice, MnDOT requested a seven-year timeframe for relocation of US 53. The two parties have signed an agreement to modify the easement vacation date to May 2017. MnDOT is conducting this project development and environmental review process to make decisions on how to best address the pending termination of easement rights. Accordingly, the approximate project termini are on US 53 at 2nd Avenue West and Cuyuna Drive. ES.2 Document Purpose The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and MnDOT are the joint lead agencies for environmental review for this project. MnDOT is the state Responsible Governmental Unit (RGU) for the proposed project and is required to comply with the requirements of the Minnesota Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) (Minnesota Statutes, sections 116D.04 and 116D.045). The project will also use federal funding from FHWA, and, as a result, FHWA is required to undertake environmental review in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). FHWA and MnDOT have prepared this Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to satisfy both MEPA and NEPA. The intent of the NEPA and MEPA processes is to ensure that potential environmental impacts are identified and considered in the decision-making process. Prior to the preparation of the Draft EIS, a Scoping process was used to obtain stakeholder input and assess a range of alternatives and potential environmental impacts. This information was used to inform decisions on the range of alternatives and level of detail for analysis of significant issues in the EIS, consistent with federal (23 CFR 771.123(b) and 40CFR 1501.7) and state (Minnesota Rules, part 4410.2100) Scoping requirements. Chapter 2: Alternatives and Section 8.1.1 of the Draft EIS describe the activities and findings of the Scoping process in greater detail. The primary purpose of the Draft EIS is to assist decision-makers in the assessment of impacts associated with the proposed project. The Draft EIS documents the Purpose and Need for the project; describes the alternatives under consideration; addresses the anticipated social, economic, and environmental impacts of the alternatives being considered for this project; defines appropriate mitigation measures; and identifies a preferred alternative. The Final EIS will summarize the public involvement during the Draft EIS process; respond to substantive comments received on the Draft EIS; and, if necessary, provide additional details on the environmental impacts of the preferred alternative and describe mitigation measures. 1 United Taconite (UTAC) is a division of Cliffs Natural Resources, Inc. UTAC leases the property from the land and mineral owner, RGGS Land and Minerals Co. For brevity, most references in this document will refer simply to “UTAC.” ES.3 Project Purpose and Need The need for undertaking this project is derived from the following transportation system needs: ■ Respond to the roadway easement terms; address the requirements set forth in agreements between the State of Minnesota and the land owner ■ Provide a facility that meets regional and inter-regional system connectivity needs and inter-regional highway corridor performance targets ■ Maintain local connectivity to the regional system and maintain efficiency of local connections ■ Provide a facility that serves current and future capacity needs, while maintaining system mobility and safety ES.4 Alternatives ES.4.1 Alternatives Considered and Dismissed During the Scoping Process MnDOT initiated Scoping of alternatives in 2011. A range of project alternatives was developed based on several data sources and stakeholder feedback, including the project Purpose and Need (see Chapter 1: Purpose and Need), previous MnDOT and UTAC design concepts, and consideration of applicable technical data. The February 2012 Scoping Document/Draft Scoping Decision Document (SDD) and September 2012 Final SDD documents describe the process of developing and evaluating the Scoping alternatives in detail. The evaluation process included consideration of issues such as how well each alternative met the Purpose and Need; potential for social, economic, and/or environmental impacts; relative estimated costs; and potential engineering feasibility issues. Stakeholder input was also an important factor in the evaluation process. After the SDD was distributed in September 2012, more detailed study of the Draft EIS alternatives and their potential impacts was performed. The initial findings regarding the cost and feasibility of some of the Build Alternatives led MnDOT to 1) reconsider some Scoping alternative alignments (i.e., Alternatives W-1 and E-1) that had been dismissed from further consideration during the 2012 Scoping process and 2) assess whether minor alignment modifications to some alternatives (i.e., Alternative E-2) would make them more feasible/cost-effective. In order to add or amend alternatives to be studied in the Draft EIS, an Amended Scoping Decision Document had to be prepared (Minnesota Rules, part 4410.2100, subpart 8). The September 2013 Amended Scoping Decision Document (ASDD) and the Alternatives Development Report (Kimley-Horn, 2014) provide details of the Scoping reassessment and the resulting decisions regarding alternatives that would be carried forward for study in the Draft EIS. The amended Scoping process alternatives and the amended Scoping decisions regarding alternatives to be carried forward for study in the Draft EIS are summarized in Section 2.2.2 of the Draft EIS and include five alternatives: ■ No Build Alternative (Existing Easement Agreement Area Closed) ■ Existing US 53 Alternative (Existing Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) ■ Alternative M-1 ■ Alternative E-1A ■ Alternative E-2 As the Draft EIS analysis continued, design details were refined as new information was obtained and decisions were made regarding construction options. These design assumptions and decisions are documented in the Alternatives Development Report (Kimley-Horn, 2014) which is included in Appendix K of the Draft EIS. Agencies and key stakeholders continued to be engaged during the preparation of the Draft EIS in the development of information for the evaluation of impacts and mitigation. The following section provides a detailed description of each alternative evaluated in this Draft EIS. All alternatives that have been carried forward for further study are shown on Figure 2.3-1. ES.4.2 Alternatives Studied in the Draft EIS ES.4.2.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) The No Build Alternative would respond to the easement terms by closing the segment of US 53 within the existing easement agreement area, resulting in traffic being rerouted to existing highways. Signage would be used to officially mark the rerouting of US 53, which would follow existing MN 37, Co. 7, and US 169 (see Figure 2.1-3). No transportation systems management (TSM) elements (i.e., maintenance or operation improvements) are included in this alternative in order to represent a true No Build Alternative and because TSM improvements on the existing roadways would not provide the needed traffic capacity given the closure of the existing easement agreement area. The following existing roadways would be designated as the official reroute of US 53 in their current condition: ■ The south interchange of MN 37 and existing US 53 would remain in place, marking the location where northbound traffic would depart from existing US 53 to the newly signed route (existing MN 37) ■ The four-mile segment of existing MN 37 to be used as US 53 is a two-lane highway with left and right turn lanes located at the intersection with Co. 7. Existing at-grade railroad crossings in this corridor would remain at-grade. ■ Northbound US 53 traffic would make a right turn from MN 37 to Co. 7, a two-lane highway, traveling 8.75 miles before making a right turn at the signalized intersection with US 169. Existing at-grade railroad crossings in this corridor would remain at-grade. ■ Less than a half-mile segment (0.4 miles) of four-lane US 169 would be used to the east to make the connection back to existing US 53 at the US 169 interchange MN 135 is currently routed from Gilbert through the existing easement agreement area and into Virginia. The designation for MN 135 would be rerouted to the south using the existing US 53 alignment (starting at the existing US 53 northbound ramp to MN 135) to the south MN 37 interchange where it would follow the new US 53 route west along MN 37 (Figure 2.1-3). US 53 within Virginia, between the US 169 interchange and the 2nd Avenue interchange, would be turned back to local government jurisdiction. This alternative does not meet project Need #3 (connectivity/travel times) or #4 (capacity/mobility) described in Section 1.3.3 and 1.3.4, respectively. To meet Need #2 (constitutional route connectivity) as described in Section 1.3.2, signing and road designation changes would be needed to maintain the road connection from Eveleth to Virginia. However, it is an important baseline for the comparison of alternatives and is required to be evaluated in the Draft EIS for comparison purposes under NEPA and the Minnesota Environmental Review program. Area of Evaluation Under the No Build Alternative, no construction would occur, and traffic would be rerouted to other roads. Therefore, the area evaluated includes the existing right-of-way of those reroute roads. ES.4.2.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) The Existing US 53 Alternative, though not in compliance with the terms of the existing easement agreement, would keep US 53 in place and open to traffic by addressing the economic, legal, and engineering issues associated with resolving the terms of the existing easement agreement. The State of Minnesota would not vacate US 53 but would keep the highway open (Figure 2.1-4). Keeping the highway open in its current location would require condemnation by the State of Minnesota to oppose termination of the existing easement agreement knowing that the owner and lessee are not willing sellers. Even with the use of eminent domain, this alternative may require a large payment from the State to the owners and operators of the minerals and mining/lease rights (RGGS and UTAC). Under this alternative, no roadway modifications would be made. While it was noted in the SDD (September 2012) that this alternative may include construction of a grade separation and other highway modifications to allow for the mine to function as one operation from both sides of US 53, it did not present details. As described in the Alternatives Development Report (Kimley-Horn, 2014; provided in Appendix K), consolidation of right-of-way and constructing a bridge for mine access were considered but determined to not provide a meaningful reduction in overall project costs or provide the mine with access to much of the existing easement agreement area to mine to offset reconstruction costs; therefore, these elements are not being further evaluated. This alternative was found in the SD/Draft SDD (February 2012) to meet all four need criteria. This alternative would indirectly honor the terms of the existing easement agreement (Need #1) by compensating the landowner and operator for land and mineral rights. Area of Evaluation Under the Existing US 53 Alternative, no construction would occur, and traffic would remain on existing US 53. Therefore, the area evaluated includes the existing right-of-way/easement agreement area of existing US 53. ES.4.2.3 Alternative M-1 All of the Build Alternatives under consideration in this Draft EIS assume construction of a new four-lane US 53 alignment. Alternative M-1 is routed through the active UTAC mine. The following details for this alternative have been refined since Scoping based on considerations of providing mine access to both sides of the new US 53 alignment, existing fill material stability, depth of current and future mining activity, embankment design in blasting zone, and structural options (bridge vs. engineered slopes). ■ New Alignment From south to north, this alternative would depart from existing US 53 approximately at Cuyuna Drive in the Midway area of Virginia. Approximately one mile of new four-lane roadway would be constructed to mostly follow the grade created by the partially-backfilled2Auburn Pit through the UTAC mine. As shown on Figure 2.1-5, the new alignment would connect back to existing US 53 approximately 1,000 feet east of the existing 12th Avenue traffic signal. ■ Local Access Existing highway connections at MN 135 and 2nd Avenue would be reconstructed to maintain community access, reusing portions of the US 53 roadway to the extent possible. The MN 135 connection would require right-of-way acquisition or a new easement with RGGS and UTAC for the retained portion of existing US 53 within the mine setback area (Figure 2.3-2). The MN 135 connection would be made by routing MN 135 on to a portion of the existing northbound US 53 highway segment south of the current US 53/MN 135 interchange. The new access would be at-grade, with the primary turning movement (westbound MN 135 to northbound US 53) facilitated with a free right turn lane. A left turn lane would be provided for the southbound US 53 to eastbound MN 135 turning movement. This intersection would be signalized (intersection geometry shown in Figure 3.1-4). 2 Backfilled material is from local sources within the mine boundary. See Section 5.12 for more detail. Due to the proximate location of Cuyuna Drive and the US 53/MN 135 intersection, local street access at Cuyuna Drive would be modified to provide adequate intersection spacing. Instead of providing Cuyuna Drive direct access from US 53, access would be provided from MN 135 to accommodate intersection spacing guidelines. As shown in Figure 2.3-2, Cuyuna Drive would be connected to MN 135 by extending Midway Drive north near the new intersection with US 53. An interchange option for this US 53 connection to MN 135 is not feasible in this location because there is not adequate space necessary for an interchange above the mine wall without involving substantial business and residential relocations in Midway. There is approximately 800 feet between the edge of the Auburn Pit wall and Cuyuna Drive, so a compressed diamond interchange (assumed to be approximately 2,000 feet long) would either have 1,200 feet of the interchange supported by structure in the pit or would require the acquisition of multiple residential and business properties in the Midway neighborhood. Given the extent of impacts and constructability concerns, an interchange at MN 135/US 53 was determined to not be feasible. The connection to 2nd Avenue would be made by using a portion of the existing US 53 highway between 2nd and 12th Avenues, which is outside of the existing easement agreement area segment that would be vacated. 2nd Avenue would be extended to create a new at-grade intersection approximately at the present location of Southern Drive in Virginia. This new Southern Drive intersection would be spaced approximately 1,000 feet east of the 12th Avenue traffic signal. The northbound segment of US 53 to be used for extension of 2nd Avenue currently features four bridge structures (a pair over 6th Avenue and a pair over a now vacated railroad corridor). The northbound bridges would remain in use, whereas the southbound bridges would be removed along with the southbound traffic lanes. Coordination with the local jurisdictions (County and City) would be necessary to make a determination regarding future ownership of these local connection roadways. The local street connection of 6th Avenue and Southern Drive, which provides access to the Ridgewood area south of US 53, would be improved by the Alternative M-1 alignment by adding direct access to US 53 via the new Southern Drive intersection (which would also provide access to 2nd Avenue as described above). New street connections in Alternative M-1 would be made by retaining the 6th Avenue underpass of northbound US 53 as shown in Figure 2.3-2. Southern Drive would be connected to US 53 at the Southern Drive at-grade intersection, with continued connectivity to the 6th Street underpass. This design would provide new access to US 53 for the Ridgewood neighborhood, while maintaining through traffic to 6th Avenue via the underpass. ■ Design Features Alternative M-1 would cross a mine area that will remain active for many years. In order to reduce the potential conflict with remaining ferrous resource reserves, a constrained highway cross section (Figure 2.3-3) was assumed for US 53 through the mine for approximately one mile (4,950 feet). The constrained cross section assumed median and outside barriers and steep side slopes. The depth of the active mine south of this alignment currently ranges from 100 to 200 feet deep. Future mining along the west side of the mine may extend down 500 feet or more. The proposed right-of-way through the mine would encompass the full road footprint. Standard blasting best practices by the mine include a 300 foot setback from the edge of right-of-way. If this setback encumbers ferrous resources, the loss of access to these resources would be expected to be included in the negotiation for acquisition of right-of-way for this alternative. Earthwork and/or structures (bridges) would be incorporated into the alignment design to allow for mine operations on both sides of the new alignment. The depth of the fill and compaction was important in determining whether the crossing could be on fill or if a structural solution would be required. Borings were conducted by MnDOT to confirm the condition of existing fill.3 A seismic study was also conducted to determine the potential effects of blasting on fill slopes and bridge structures within the mine area.4 As a result it was determined that an engineered fill could be used across most of the mine with bridges 3 Preliminary Geotechnical Engineering Report for the TH 53 Relocation: M-1 Foundations (Gale-Tec Engineering, 2013); available at http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/TechnicalReports.html 4 Proposed TH 53 M-1 (and E-2) Alignment, Virginia, MN: Report of Seismic Study of Mine Blast Induced Vibrations (HDR, 2013); available at http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/TechnicalReports.html constructed in two locations to accommodate mining access needs. An all fill section would not allow mine equipment to cross the road, and an all bridge section would be more costly with no additional benefit gained. The engineered fill could be constructed with 1:2 slopes, minimizing the footprint of the fill section in the mine. The depth of the active mine south of this alignment currently ranges from 100 to 200 feet deep. Future mining along the west side of the mine may extend down 500 feet or more. To address potential mine business risks (air quality compliance issues), a covering over a portion of the Auburn Pit crossing (an elevated tunnel concept) was evaluated as a potential mitigation strategy. This tunnel could be constructed with concrete barrier walls on each side supporting a three-sided concrete box structure to enclose the road and air handling equipment. Details of the tunnel construction assumptions can be found in Highway 53 M-1 Alignment Air Quality Mitigation Assessment (CH2M Hill, 2013) and the Structural Cost Estimate for Elevated Tunnel for US 53 Alternative M-1 Air Quality Mitigation (Kimley-Horn, 2013) provided in Appendix E. This alternative was found in the SD/Draft SDD (February 2012) to meet all four need criteria. Area of Evaluation The potential physical impacts from this alternative were evaluated for the area shown in Figure 2.1-5. Physical impacts can be defined as areas where ground disturbance is likely to occur under one or more construction option. As noted above, this alternative would require fill across much of the Auburn Pit. The area of evaluation for Alternative M-1 represents the assumed alignment and extends to the bottom of the fill slope or the estimated limits of construction. It also includes areas anticipated for stormwater management and local road connections. ES.4.2.4 Alternative E-1A Alternative E-1A is routed through the UTAC permit to mine and environmental setting boundaries, north of existing US 53 (see Figure 2.2-1). This alternative was added through the amended Scoping process described in Section 2.2. Alternative E-1 was initially not carried forward because of the potential for mine business risks due to air quality compliance concerns (compared to other East Corridor alternatives), higher right-of-way costs due to conflicts with the existing UTAC permit to mine area and environmental setting boundary, and construction costs due to crossing the widest portion of the Rouchleau Pit. However, additional assessment of construction options and modification of this alternative determined that Alternative E-1A could reduce the business risk impacts from mine air quality compliance concerns. The features of this alternative assumed for analysis in this Draft EIS are described below. ■ New Alignment From south to north, this alternative diverges from existing US 53 just north of Cuyuna Drive. The alignment crosses MN 135 between the existing US 53 interchange and Bourgin Road. The new alignment then continues parallel to Bourgin Road before turning to the northwest to cross the Rouchleau Pit along an existing submerged haul road embankment.5 After crossing the pit, the alignment turns to the southwest to reconnect with existing US 53 near 2nd Avenue. The road cross section was assumed to be constrained across the Rouchleau Pit (four lanes with a two-foot wide median barrier). A barrier would be considered on the south side of the roadway for safety and screening reasons. All stormwater would be treated and/or removed from the roadway and not discharged directly into the Rouchleau Pit. The storm sewer system would also allow containment of any potential spills on the roadway. Two construction design options for crossing the Rouchleau Pit are evaluated for this alternative. The first is a reinforced soil slope (RSS) causeway/fill section (RSS Option). The second option is a bridge crossing of the pit (Bridge Option). Both options would follow the existing submerged haul road across the Rouchleau Pit. 5 Backfilled material in this haul road is from local sources within the mine boundary. See Section 5.12 for more detail. ■ RSS Option: This option would require the placement of fill below the existing water level and extending up to 160 feet in elevation above the water line. To minimize the fill footprint, a steep fill slope (up to 60% slope) would be required, and the height of the road would be kept as low as possible across the pit, resulting in a low point near the middle of the crossing. (Construction methods [i.e., dry vs. wet fill placement] for this design option are described in Section 5.3.3.2.) This option may require a future bridge (75 feet by 165 feet) to be constructed east of the Rouchleau Pit to allow for mining access to the north of the new alignment. ■ Bridge Option: This option would place the road on a bridge structure across the pit, eliminating the need for fill within the Rouchleau Pit and allowing the road elevation to be increased and drain to the west side of the pit. This bridge would allow for future mine access to the north but may restrict distance from the bridge that mining/blasting activity may occur. Any trail (pedestrian, bicycle, ATV, snowmobile) access to the south side of the highway would be prohibited due to mine safety concerns. The Mesabi Trail and utilities may be allowed within MnDOT rightof-way (with the trail on the north side of the highway, away from the mine activity) via a permit (may be constructed in conjunction with the project but funded by the trail and utility owners/operators; the St. Louis and Lake Counties Regional Railroad Authority (SLLCRRA) and the utility owners have received state bond funds for utility and trail relocation). ■ Local Access The 2nd Avenue interchange would be replaced with a full access, at-grade, signalized intersection, similar to Alternative E-2 (Figure 2.3-4). This improves access (currently no southbound to westbound movement available) while eliminating the right-of-way and maintenance needed for the existing interchange loop and bridges. There are two intersection options evaluated for MN 135 at US 53. ■ Intersection Option: An unsignalized, ¾ intersection6 would be used at the US 53/MN 135 intersection, with no left turns allowed from westbound MN 135 to US 53 (intersection geometry shown in Figure 2.3-5). ■ Interchange Option: A compressed diamond interchange would provide full access between US 53 and MN 135, as shown in Figure 2.3-5. The Landfill Road intersection with MN 135 would remain at its current location. A short segment of Landfill Road would need to be shifted east due to elevation differences between it and the new US 53 alignment. ■ Design Features This alternative is within the UTAC permit to mine and environmental setting boundaries, although little further conflict with remaining ferrous resources is anticipated. In order to reduce the amount of fill within the Rouchleau Pit, a constrained highway cross section (Figure 2.3-3) was assumed for US 53 through the pit for approximately one-half mile (2,800 feet). The constrained cross section assumed median and outside barriers under both the RSS and Bridge Options. ■ RSS Option: This option would allow for a shallower crossing of the Rouchleau Pit along an existing submerged haul road embankment. The pit may be partially dewatered or local construction dewatering (e.g., coffer dam) may be used, and the road would be constructed via a fill section through the pit. A mine access bridge southeast of the Rouchleau Pit could eventually be constructed in the future, if needed, to allow for mine vehicle passage under US 53 above the current water line. 6 A ¾ intersection (also known as a right-in/right-out/left-in-only intersection) permits access from the through approach (US 53) and the stop-controlled approach (MN 135) via right-turn movements and allows the left-turn movement from the through approach (US 53) to the stop-controlled approach (MN 135). A number of dewatering discharge options have been evaluated to inform potential construction impact analysis. Details regarding the options assessed can be found in the TH 53 Relocation Alternative E-1A RSS Construction Option Water Management Study (HDR, 2014; provided in Appendix G). The effects of constructing the Rouchleau Pit crossing in the dry (via pit drawdown or localized dewatering) and in the wet (fill placed below water) condition are evaluated in Sections 5.2 and 5.3, providing a summary of the recommended options for dewatering discharge and their potential impacts. ■ Bridge Option: The pit is approximately five to 25 feet deep at the crossing location, and the bridge would span approximately 3,000 feet. The alignment would follow the submerged haul road embankment to minimize pier height. This option must consider design criteria to withstand blasting operations in the adjacent mine and areas of potential unstable fill. This alternative was found in the ASDD (September 2013) to meet all four need criteria. ■ Area of Evaluation The potential physical impacts from this alternative were evaluated for the area shown in Figure 2.2-1. Physical impacts can be defined as areas where ground disturbance is likely to occur under one or more construction option. As noted above, this alternative includes two options for crossing the Rouchleau Pit generally following the submerged haul road. The area of evaluation was widened across the Rouchleau Pit for Alternative E-1A in areas where there is potential for design adjustments in the alignment to accommodate currently undefined solutions to known engineering challenges (e.g., existing areas of unstable fill and bridge type). The intent of evaluating the wider area was to identify potential impacts and determine if there were any environmental resources that could limit implementation of the design options being considered. As determined by analysis of aerial photography and data collection within the widened area of evaluation, it generally has consistent vegetation/cover types (i.e., mostly forested with some wetlands, or rock pit walls and water) and has no existing development or noise receptors. Since most of the widened area is within the previously mined area in and adjacent to the Rouchleau Pit, the alignment adjustments should result in little difference in impacts to resources except for ferrous resources and right-of-way. Impacts to vegetation and wetlands were determined to be similar regardless of where the final alignment would be oriented within the widened area (see Chapter 4: Community and Social Analysis and Chapter 5: Physical and Environmental Analysis for more details). To calculate potential impacts without overestimating them due to the widened area of evaluation, a corridor averaging 200-400 feet wide was assumed for Alternative E-1A within the area of evaluation. ES.4.2.5 Alternative E-2 Alternative E-2 is routed around the UTAC permit to mine and environmental setting boundaries. The following details for this alternative have been refined since Scoping based on considerations of crossing the Rouchleau Pit, structural vs. fill options, bridge design in blasting zone, depth of pit, lands permitted or leased for mine operations, and construction staging considerations.7 ■ New Alignment From south to north, Alternative E-2 generally follows existing US 53 from the Midway area to the MN 135 exit ramp for the start of new four-lane construction. As shown in Figure 2.1-6, the new alignment then continues on a northeasterly track on the present day Landfill Road corridor before turning to the west to cross over the Rouchleau Pit. Upon crossing the pit, Alternative E-2 turns to the southwest following an abandoned railroad corridor that runs between the pit and residential neighborhoods before reconnecting to existing US 53 at 2nd Avenue. Areas of roadway that would be removed are shown in Figure 2.3-6. 7 Alignment development details are further described in the Alternatives Development Report available in Appendix K. Permitted and leased mining operations are defined in Section 4.2. Two alignments are being considered for Alternative E-2 between Midway and roughly MN 135.8 Both options extend from a point just north of Cuyuna Drive on the south end to approximately the point where the Mesabi Trail crosses existing Landfill Road just north of the MN 135. ■ Straight Option: This is a westerly route that follows existing US 53 and the exit ramp to MN 135. This option minimizes new disturbance by following existing roads to the extent possible. The area of evaluation for this option includes a wider section just south of MN 135 to allow for design flexibility to shift the alignment east of the existing easement agreement area, if needed, to minimize mining setback and wetland impacts. ■ Curved Setback Option: This route shifts east of existing US 53, similar to the alignment of Alternative E-1A south of MN 135. The purpose of this option is to facilitate staging of project construction and to minimize or potentially avoid encroachment on the mine setback from the road, shifting the alignment to the east at least 300 feet. The actual alignment shift exceeds 300 feet to also minimize impacts to the wetland that is located between US 53 and this option. ■ Local Access The 2nd Avenue access would be converted from the existing partial interchange to an at-grade intersection. The existing 2nd Avenue interchange does not allow for turns from southbound US 53 to 2nd Avenue or from 2nd Avenue to northbound US 53. The new 2nd Avenue intersection would provide access to and from US 53 in all directions. Both intersections would be signalized (intersection geometry shown in Figure 3.1-5). There are two intersection options evaluated for MN 135 at US 53. ■ Intersection Option: With this option, as shown in Figure 2.3-7, MN 135 would be slightly realigned to accommodate a new at-grade intersection with US 53, replacing the existing interchange. An unsignalized, ¾ intersection would be used at the US 53/MN 135 intersection, with no left turns allowed from westbound MN 135 to US 53 (intersection geometry shown in Figure 3.1-5). ■ Interchange Option: With this option, a compressed diamond interchange would be constructed to provide full access between US 53 and MN 135, as shown in Figure 2.3-7. Access to Landfill Road would be maintained with a new at-grade connection approximately one-half mile north of the new US 53/MN 135 intersection. A median break in the US 53 corridor would allow for access to Landfill Road for travelers from both directions on US 53. ■ Design Features A constrained highway cross section between the new Landfill Road access and 2nd Avenue, approximately one mile (5,500 feet) long, was assumed in order to reduce the potential impacts of the Alternative E-2 route along the west side of and across the Rouchleau Pit. The constrained cross section assumed median and outside barriers and steep side slopes (Figure 2.3-3). East of the Rouchleau Pit a continuation of the existing cross section from the south is planned. The new Landfill Road access median break was assumed to be located outside of the constrained cross section. The US 53 median at Landfill Road would provide a refuge for vehicles making turning movements across US 53 at Landfill Road. The most feasible pit crossing method for this alternative was determined to be a bridge; a fill option was eliminated based on constructability issues. A fill section across the pit is not expected to be feasible due to the depth of the water and pit and the width of the fill footprint at this location. At 1:2 slopes the fill footprint at the bottom of the fill would be at least 950 feet wide and require nearly 10 million cubic yards of fill material; with more reasonable slopes of 1:4, the footprint and fill material needed would double. Additionally, given the depth of water to be contained on the north side of the fill (125 feet currently), the 8 The Alternative E-2 Curved Setback Option was developed after the completion of the Alternatives Development Report and, therefore, is not discussed in that document. fill would require engineering for a dam to support the water pressure as well as blasting vibration. The dam design would also need to consider future water level fluctuations as dewatering changes occur. Given the extent of constructability concerns and costs compared to a bridge, the fill option was dropped from further consideration for this alternative. Therefore, a bridge would be used to cross the Rouchleau Pit. The pit is approximately 250 feet deep at the crossing location, and the bridge would span approximately 1,350 feet. Crossing primarily on structure would minimize potential fill quantity and stability concerns. This alternative must consider design criteria to withstand blasting operations in the adjacent mine. Constructability assessments have indicated that a bridge crossing of the pit represents comparable constructability issues and cost impacts as other alternatives. This alternative was found in the SD/Draft SDD (February 2012) to meet all four need criteria. ■ Area of Evaluation The potential physical impacts from this alternative were evaluated for the area shown in Figure 2.1-6. Physical impacts can be defined as areas where ground disturbance is likely to occur under one or more construction option. As noted above, this alternative includes a bridge crossing over the Rouchleau Pit. The area of evaluation was widened across the Rouchleau Pit for Alternative E-2 in areas where there is potential for design adjustments in the alignment to accommodate currently undefined solutions to known engineering challenges (e.g., existing areas of unstable fill and bridge type). The intent of evaluating the wider area was to identify potential impacts and determine if there were any environmental resources that could limit implementation of the design options being considered. As determined by analysis of aerial photography and data collection within the widened area of evaluation near the Rouchleau Pit, it generally has consistent vegetation/cover types (i.e., mostly forested with some wetlands, or rock pit walls and water) and has no existing development or noise receptors. Since most of the widened area is within the previously mined area in and adjacent to the Rouchleau Pit, the alignment adjustments should result in little difference in impacts to resources except for ferrous resources and right-of-way. Impacts to vegetation and wetlands were determined to be similar regardless of where the final alignment would be oriented within the widened area (see Chapter 4: Community and Social Analysis and Chapter 5: Physical and Environmental Analysis for more details). To calculate potential impacts without overestimating them due to the widened area of evaluation, a corridor averaging 150-300 feet wide was assumed for Alternative E-2 within the area of evaluation. ES.5 Potential Impacts The effects of the No Build, Existing US 53, M-1, E-1A, and E-2 Alternatives, including options, were evaluated and compared across a range of subject areas related to the built and natural environment. The Existing US 53 Alternative essentially resulted in no impacts except right-of-way and economic/business impacts, which are summarized in the following paragraph. A summary of impacts from the other alternatives is provided in Table ES-1. The Existing US 53 Alternative requires the fee acquisition of 77 acres of land to maintain the existing easement agreement area, including mineral rights. The mitigation to the landowner is fair compensation under the Uniform Relocation Act. Encumbering the ferrous resources in this area also requires potential compensation for impacts to the mine operator for lost production. These expenditures would be considered a long-term investment but an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of financial resources. The total capital cost of construction is estimated to be $400-600 million. Table ES-1.

These include estimates for: ■ Construction: includes preliminary estimates for mobilization, removals, excavation, materials (i.e., pavement, aggregate), traffic control/signing and striping, storm sewer and drainage, turf establishment and erosion control, bridges, culverts, retaining walls, noise walls, lighting, and traffic signals, and other miscellaneous construction costs. Also includes 12 percent for professional services necessary to complete construction. Construction costs were inflated to 2015 dollars to reflect anticipated year of construction. ■ Right-of-Way/Land/Mitigation: includes estimated right-of-way acquisition (permanent; greater than 99 years), relocation costs, air quality mitigation, mine operating expenses, mineral rights, and other compensation Estimates for unit costs were reviewed and evaluated based on identified risks for cost variation, and a Monte Carlo simulation9 was used to develop estimated cost ranges for each alternative based on these 9 Monte Carlo simulation is a computerized mathematical technique that allows for risk in quantitative analysis and decision making to be taken into account. It furnishes the decision-maker with a range of possible outcomes and the probabilities they will occur for any choice of action. risks. Specific unit costs for ferrous and non-ferrous resources were not available at the time of this estimate and therefore were not specifically included; however, the cost ranges were set to cover a range of risks associated with these and other unknown costs and/or variability in cost factors. Preliminary cost ranges for each of the alternatives, separated into the construction and right-of-way/land/mitigation cost categories described above, are provided in Table ES-3. The ranges shown are for the purpose of comparing alternatives at an order-of-magnitude level and are based on concept-level footprints and information available at the time of Draft EIS preparation. Additional cost factors, such as operation and maintenance costs, have not been included in these estimates at this time. Refined cost information for the preferred alternative will be report in the Final EIS, as available. The ferrous and non-ferrous resource valuations are underway and will be used in right-of-way negotiations. This analysis will estimate value based on the amount and quality (level of oxidation) of ferrous resources present, as well as its accessibility/location. Samples are being evaluated for indicators of ferrous and non-ferrous resources and potential for these resources within the areas of evaluation for each alternative. Table ES-3.

Does not include costs for maintenance/operation. B Future mine access bridge anticipated to add approximately $12 million to the cost of the Alternative E-1A RSS Option (2015 dollars). ES.7.2 Available Funding ES.7.2.1 Estimate of Cost The estimated total project cost of the preferred alternative (in 2015 dollars) is $180 to $240 million. ES.7.2.2 Anticipated Funding The funds allocated for the proposed project (SP 6918-80 and associated projects) are a combination of federal and state funds. ■ Federal: $30 million (National Highway Performance Program – NHPP) ■ State Trunk Highway Bonds: $34 million (Chapter 152) MnDOT currently has $30 million in federal funds and $34 million in state bonds shown for preliminary engineering and initial construction in the approved Fiscal Year 2015-2018 State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP). These funds will be used both for preliminary engineering and for actual construction. At present there is a gap between the identified funding and the range for the total project cost ($240 million for the preferred alternative). Since maintaining this connection is critical to the state of Minnesota it is likely that the funding gap may be addressed through legislation in the upcoming 2015 legislative session beginning January 6, 2015. Without legislative action the funding gap would be addressed through major changes to the existing program, resulting in MnDOT’s failure to meet performance outcomes identified in the Minnesota State Highway Investment Plan (MnSHIP),10 or accepting the No Build Alternative for this project. The gap between the funding dedicated to the project as programmed in the current STIP and what it would take to build the preferred alternative would have to be programmed in an approved STIP before the lead federal agency (FHWA) could issue a Record of Decision for this project. ES.8 Selection of a Preferred Alternative Based on the analysis conducted for and presented in this Draft EIS, MnDOT has identified a preferred alternative: Alternative E-2. Each alternative evaluated had unique and challenging issues and a combination of impacts. A summary of the rationale used to reach this conclusion is outlined below for each alternative, starting with the preferred alternative. See Section 10.3 for more details. ES.8.1 Preferred Alternative Alternative E-2 includes a 1,300-foot long bridge with 180-foot or taller bridge piers within the Rouchleau Pit. It is recommended as the preferred alternative based on its ability to meet the project Purpose and Need and minimize impacts to social, economic, and environmental resources, and on the basis of a number of technical and cost considerations, as described below. Both the Straight Option and Curved Setback Option are being carried forward with the preferred alternative for further refinement; however, one will be identified as the selected option in the Final EIS based on public and agency comment, refinement of the design, and overall environmental impacts. MN 135 and US 53 are currently connected via an interchange. The Highway Safety Manual (HSM) was used to compare crash rates for the Intersection and Interchange Options. The results were essentially the same for the two options at the level of the HSM analysis for the years 2009, 2017, and 2037. Both options have similar levels of service with the exception of the southbound movement in the PM peak hour for the Intersection Option. While the results were essentially the same between the Intersection Option and Interchange Option at the level of the HSM analysis for the years 2009, 2017, and 2037, this analysis does not account for the grade difference for the east approach between these options. With the Interchange Option, the grade of MN 135 from the east can be reduced from six percent to two percent as compared to the Intersection Option. The Intersection Option would require a much steeper grade (six percent) at the east approach, which would be expected to result in increased difficulty for loaded semi-trucks turning left onto US 53 in the winter (November to April). This difficulty would increase the potential for semi-truck/vehicle conflict at the intersection, which could increase crash risk and result in the intersection being the less desirable option based on safety. This reduction in grade would also reduce the earthwork and rock cut quantities required for construction. Maintenance of existing access and minimizing delays at US 53 and MN 135 has been strongly supported by the public during public meetings. Therefore, the Interchange Option was selected for the preferred alternative over the Intersection Option. Benefits of the preferred alternative include: ■ Mineral Rights: Avoids the permit to mine/environmental setting boundary ■ Business Risks: Has no risk for air quality compliance to impact mine operations ■ Water Supply: Avoids the major dewatering that would be required for the Alternative E-1 RSS Option ■ Wetlands: Both the Straight and Curved Setback Options have fewer wetland impacts than Alternative E-1A (RSS or Bridge Option). The Straight Option has fewer wetland impacts than Alternative M-1, and the Curved Setback Option has wetland impacts similar to Alternative M-1. ■ Noise: A noise wall is preliminarily cost effective at affected residential locations ■ Right-of-Way: Impacts the fewest number of parcels of any Build Alternative ■ Engineering and Constructability Considerations: ■ Shorter bridge than the Alternative E-1A Bridge Option ■ Only two pier foundations required, compared to up to eight for the Alternative E-1A Bridge Option ■ Less work required to construct in the water/ice of the Rouchleau Pit ■ Avoids 40 mph curve needed for Alternative E-1A ■ Has a better sight distance northbound from the bridge to the 2nd Avenue traffic signal than Alternative E-1A ■ Piers to be constructed in less than 30 feet of mine waste fill as compared to Alternative E-1A that would have up to 100 feet of mine waste fill ■ Schedule: Has the least schedule risk due to engineering constructability considerations noted above as well as considerations related to owner and operator property interests ■ Cost: Costs significantly less than the Existing US 53 Alternative and Alternative M-1, and the upper range of the cost estimate is less than that for either the Alternative E-1A RSS Option or Bridge Option The negative effects of this alternative include: ■ Mineral Rights: More mineral encumbrance than Alternative E-1A; requires greater impact to School Trust land and, therefore, has potential for greater impact to Vermillion Gold, Inc.’s lease than Alternative E-1A ■ Section 4(f): Impacts the Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area (OHVRA); however, the impact is negligible and meets the definition of de minimis ■ Vegetation/Cover Types: Impacts more acres of forest than other alternatives; however, impacts to wildlife are negligible ■ Unknowns: Requires additional geotechnical characterization at pier locations 10 Available at http://www.dot.state.mn.us/planning/mnship/pdf/mnship-full-doc.pdf ES.8.2 Other Alternatives Considered ES.8.2.1 No Build Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Closed) The No Build Alternative was carried forward for analysis as the “do nothing alternative” because it was required for comparison to other alternatives. It is not identified as the preferred alternative since other Build Alternatives (i.e., M-1, E-1A, and E-2) would meet all of the identified project needs with less severe social, economic, and environmental impacts. ES.8.2.2 Existing US 53 Alternative (Easement Agreement Area Remains Open) The Existing US 53 Alternative would have substantially greater uncertainty and cost than any of the Build Alternatives; therefore, it was not selected as the preferred alternative. ES.8.2.3 Alternative M-1 Alternative M-1 has feasibility issues and would result in severe negative impacts that are not offset by the benefits in minimization; therefore, it was not identified as the preferred alternative. ES.8.2.4 Alternative E-1A RSS Option The Alternative E-1A RSS Option has feasibility issues and would result in severe schedule and constructability impacts (i.e., it is unlikely to meet the timeline due to dewatering, with substantial risks for additional delays due to weather, mine waste fill, and design requirements to mitigate constructability concerns) that are not offset by the benefits in minimization of environmental impacts; therefore, it was not identified as the preferred alternative. Bridge Option The Alternative E-1A Bridge Option has feasibility issues and would result in severe negative schedule impacts (i.e., it would require the greatest construction effort to meet the timeline, with substantial risks for delays due to weather, mine waste fill, and design requirements to mitigate constructability concerns) that are not offset by the benefits in minimization of environmental impacts; therefore, it was not identified as the preferred alternative. ES.9 Permits and Approvals Permits and approvals that may be required for the proposed project are listed in Table ES-3. Table ES-3.
