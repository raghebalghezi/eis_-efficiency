The Proposed Action is the preferred alternative, and proposes to treat only dead vegetation within a variable width buffer (maximum width of 300 feet with a minimum of 25 feet on either side of the road) along 233 miles of open road (approximately 8,000 acres of treatment). Treatment of vegetation would include falling hazard trees, utilizing the timber (salvage logging), reducing the fuel loading, planting trees, and maintaining the fuels treatments. These actions are needed to: • Mitigate hazards (i.e. fire-killed or defective trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public safety along open National Forest System, County and State roads. • Sustain and establish forest cover; and, • Capture economic value and support the economies of local communities by providing forest products. The Shasta-Trinity National Forest and Six Rivers National Forest and adjacent State and private lands experienced wildfire on more than 221,000 acres as a result of lightning in 2015. The majority of acres affected are the result of a July 30, 2015 lightning event. Much of the fire burned through National Forest System lands (approximately 176,000 acres), but a number of private landowners were also affected. Approximately 144,000 acres were burned on Shasta-Trinity National Forest lands. The areas on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest affected by the 2015 wildfires include vegetation along 391 miles of road (359 miles of National Forest System roads, 32 miles administered by state and county).  Of these 391 miles, 248 miles are open to the public (including Forest Service system roads and county and state roads). Of these 248 miles of open roads, 233 miles of Forest Service system, county and state roads travel through Shasta-Trinity National Forest lands. Forested lands burned in the fires contain a substantial number of dead and dying trees within reach of these roads. Structural integrity of fire-killed trees has been compromised and it is expected many of them will fall during a wind or storm event. Especially considering the steep topography, many of these trees are likely to fall into open roads, creating a risk to public health and safety. A range of issues were raised during public scoping. These issues led the agency to develop alternatives to the proposed action including: • Alternative 2: This alternative would treat a consistent buffer 150’ on each side of the road and would create fuelbreaks of up to 1200’ wide on 16 miles of those roads to create more effective fuels reduction treatments. Alternative 2 would remove trees and vegetation with a 60% chance of mortality as well as the completely dead trees that would be cut in the proposed action. • Alternative 3: This alternative would treat a wider buffer (up to 300’ on each side of the road). Alternative 3 would also remove dying trees and vegetation (with a 60% chance of mortality or more) to address all trees with the potential to pose a hazard to roads. • Alternative 4: This alternative would reduce impacts to the northern spotted owl (NSO) by eliminating most treatments within high value habitat. • Alternative 5: This alternative would minimize impacts to sensitive resources by eliminating most treatments within high value NSO habitat, riparian reserves, at-risk watersheds, and Inventoried Roadless Areas. Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project • Alternative 6: This is the-no action alternative.  Under this alternative it is assumed that no areas within the Shasta Trinity National Forest that were affected by the 2015 wildfires would be treated as part of this project. • An alternative that would treat only along high use roads (Operational Maintenance Level 3 and above) was considered but eliminated from detailed study. • An alternative that the Trinity County Collaborative group proposed that would be similar to the proposed action but would include a bulldozer line along the treatment buffer and would rip soils to decrease hydrophobicity in fire damaged soils was considered but eliminated from detailed study. • An alternative that would salvage and replant on a larger landscape outside of the road buffer was considered but eliminated from detailed study. • An alternative that would treat a buffer along Wildland Urban Interface boundaries and along private land boundaries was considered by eliminated from detailed study. The proposed action is also referred to as Alternative 1. All of the action alternatives considered in detail (Alternatives 1-5) conduct treatments along all 233 miles of open road.  The alternatives differ in the type and intensity of the treatments along those roads. Under all of the action alternatives, hazard trees would be felled along all 233 miles of road. Alternatives 2 and 3 would also fell dying trees (trees with a 60% or greater chance of mortality) within the treatment buffer, thereby reducing the future risk of falling trees once dying trees become imminent hazards. Alternative 3, which would fell trees within 300’ of either side of the road, would most completely address the hazard posed by falling trees. Fuels treatments would vary depending on the alternative and the location.  Under Alternatives 1, 2, and 3, treatments along up to 206 miles of road would reduce flame lengths and fireline intensity to a level that would allow a future wildfire to be attacked by persons using hand tools.  The remaining 27 miles of road have been designated as high value wildlife conservation areas (HVWCAs) because of their value as habitat for the NSO.  Within HVWCAs, restrictions imposed on fuels treatments would lead to greater flame lengths and fire intensity in the event of a future wildfire. Within HVWCAs, future wildfires could still be attacked effectively but would require the use of heavy equipment such as dozers, engines, and aircraft. Alternatives 2 and 3 would involve more effective fuels treatments than Alternative 1 for two reasons.  Under alternatives 2 and 3, dying (as well as dead) vegetation would be cut, further reducing the fuel load.  Second, the variable-width buffer in Alternative 1 (as well as Alternatives 4 & 5) would likely be less than 100 feet wide below the road in some locations; fire behavior in those locations would then exceed initial attack capabilities below the road.  This second situation would likely not arise under Alternative 2 (which treats a consistent 150’ buffer below the road) or Alternative 3 (which treats up to 300’ feet depending on the fuel reduction need).  Alternative 2 also prescribes the creation of fuelbreaks which would reduce the risk of crown fire (fire moving from the ground into the forest canopy) along 16 miles of roads. Alternatives 4 and 5 would be as effective as Alternative 1 in the areas where fuel reduction treatments occur, but fuels reduction treatments would occur in fewer areas under Alternatives 4 and 5.  Under Alternative 1, treatments along up to 206 miles of road would result in flame lengths and fireline intensity that would allow a future wildfire to be attacked by persons using hand tools.  Under alternative 4, a maximum of 175 miles would be treated to this level and under Alternative 5, a maximum of 122 miles would be treated to this level.  Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project Tree planting would occur as part of all action alternatives.  Under Alternatives 1, 4, and 5 trees would be planted to an 18-30 foot spacing.  Under Alternatives 2 and 3, trees would be planted to a 15-30 foot spacing.  By using a slightly denser spacing in Alternatives 2 and 3, trees will have an opportunity to shade out competition as they grow, thereby improving the likelihood of reaching mature forest conditions. The economic value of felled trees would be captured and returned to local communities under Alternatives 1-4 through the use of salvage logging and other timber utilization activities. Commercial timber sales (salvage logging) is proposed on 4,100 acres under the Proposed Action, 5,300 acres under Alternative 2, 7,700 acres under Alternative 3, and 780 acres under Alternative 4. Assuming that the trees would be harvested in 2017, all of the logging would occur at a net cost to the government, ranging from a cost of $130,000 under Alternative 4 to a cost of $950,000 under alternative 3 (Alternative 1 would cost $480,000 and Alternative 2 would cost $640,000).  All of the action alternatives would create economic value through employment.  Employment would range from a low of 212 person-years of direct and indirect employment under Alternative 5 to a high of 1,019 person-years under Alternative 3 (Alternatives 1 and 4 would each create about 300 person-years and alternative 2 would create about 400 person-years). Two analysis-driving issues were identified during the public scoping process: sediment delivery to streams and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Total sediment delivery to streams is a function of both background erosion rates on the burned slopes and erosion caused by project activities.  Looking just at project activities, sediment delivery to streams is estimated to be about 4,000 tons under Alternatives 1 and 2, or about 0.003 tons per acre of the project area.  Project activities would deliver about 6,000 tons (0.005 tons/ac) under Alternative 3 while activities would deliver about 2,000 tons (0.001 tons/ac) and 400 tons (0.0003 tons/ac) under Alternatives 4 and 5, respectively.  For comparison, the background rate of sedimentation averaged about 1.6 tons per acre per year over the period of 1944 to 1990.  Additionally, the geology analysis found that none of the action alternatives are expected to cause new landslides or reactivate existing ones. Finally, the soils analysis shows that, in areas where the 2015 fires burned with moderate to high intensity, salvage logging and fuels treatments such as mastication can reduce background erosion rates (and sediment delivery to streams) by increasing soil cover. CO2 emissions were also identified as an issue for analysis. The great majority of CO2 emissions come from prescribed fire.  For example, the estimated CO2 emissions from mastication of fuels is 100 times smaller than the emissions from prescribed fire.  Under Alternative 1, total CO2 emissions were calculated to be 190,000 metric tons. Under Alternative 2, these same emissions would be 220,000 tons, under Alternative 3 they would be 360,000 tons, under Alternative 4 they would be 130,000 tons, and under Alternative 5 they would be 90,000 tons. The project analysis also calculates tons of CO2-equivalent emissions. Regarding effects to wildlife, these would be greatest under Alternative 3, which has the widest treatment buffer (600 feet total).  Alternative 2 would have less effect.  Although fuelbreaks are proposed in this alternative, the roadside treatment buffer is only half as wide as Alternative 3 (300 feet total). Alternative 1 would have less effect because it has the same treatment buffer (300 feet) but does not include fuelbreaks.  It also limits treatment to dead vegetation. Alternative 4 would have less effect because it would affect fewer acres. Alternative 5 would affect the fewest acres, and would have the least effect on wildlife of any of the action alternatives. Specific to the NSO, effects will be negative in the short term but will not downgrade nesting/roosting or foraging habitat.  Some post-fire foraging habitat may be downgraded.  These effects will be greatest with the implementation of Alternative 3, followed by Alternatives 2, 1, 4, and 5 in that order. Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project For all alternatives, including the proposed action, there will be no effect to the Multi-habitat or Cliffs, Caves, Talus, and Rock Outcrops management indicator assemblages. Proposed activities will affect the Openings and Early Seral, Late Seral, Snag and Down Log, Riparian, Hardwood, and Chaparral management indicator assemblages. The potential effects will be qualitative, not quantitative. There will be no acreage changes to any habitat assemblages or conversion from one assemblage into another assemblage as a result of activities proposed under any alternative. Proposed activities will have no meaningful influence on Forest-level trends for any management indicator assemblage habitat or species. For all alternatives, including the proposed action, proposed treatments would maintain a diversity of functional habitats for migratory birds over the short and long-term, and contribute to long-term sustainability and resilience of migratory bird habitats. Proposed activities will have no meaningful influence on population trends of any species of migratory bird. Alternatives 1-4 would result in treatments within Inventoried Roadless Area (IRA) boundaries and the IRAs would be indirectly impacted by treatments proposed in Alternative 5. Many of the areas proposed for treatment are the outer edges of buffers originating from roads outside, but adjacent to the IRAs. However, there are some roads proposed for treatment within the IRA boundaries as well. Treatments have the potential to impact the Bell Quinby, Chanchelulla, Cow Creek, Little French Creek, Pattision and Salt Gulch IRAs. The 2001 roadless rule identifies nine characteristics that are common to most inventoried roadless areas. These serve as the criteria by which each alternative is evaluated. All treatments are within or directly adjacent to managed/impacted areas within the IRAs. With the treatments focused on existing road corridors, it is anticipated that impacts to the nine roadless characteristics will be minimal and will not affect the ability for that area to continue to function as and meet the intent of an inventoried roadless area. The analysis above is discussed in greater detail within the following sections of Chapter 3 of this document: fire and fuels, vegetation, wildlife, hydrology, geology, soils, air quality, economics, and Inventoried Roadless Areas. Additional analysis of the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives can be found in the botany, fish, archaeology/heritage, and wild & scenic rivers sections of Chapter 3.  In general, the greatest impacts to resources would occur with the implementation of Alternative 3, followed by Alternatives 2, 1, 4, and 5, in that order.  Based upon the effects of the alternatives, the responsible official will review the proposed action, the alternatives, and their environmental consequences, in order to determine whether to implement the proposed action as described, select a different alternative, or take no action at this time. Table of Contents Chapter 1 – Purpose of and Need for

The majority of acres affected are the result of a July 30, 2015 lightning event. Much of the fire areas burned through National Forest System lands (approximately 176,000 acres), but a number of private landowners were also affected. Approximately 144,000 acres were burned on Shasta-Trinity National Forest lands. Wildfires affected most land allocations including designated Wilderness, Adaptive Management Areas, and Late-Successional Reserve. Inventoried Roadless Areas are also affected. Five fire complexes and one separate fire burned on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest Figure 1-1: The Fork Complex near the communities of Hayfork, Post Mountain, and Wildwood, and included the Barker, Peak, Rail, Shiell, Blue and Big Foot fires; The South Complex north and east of the community of Hyampom, and included the Castle, York and Pattison fires; The Mad River Complex near the communities of Mad River, Ruth, and Forest Glen, and included the Pickett, Lassic, and Gobbler fires; The Route Complex near the communities of Mad River and Hyampom, and included the Johnson, Blake and Pelletreau fires; The River Complex near the Hoopa Reservation, the communities of Burnt Ranch and Denny, and within the Trinity Alps Wilderness Area; and The Saddle Fire northwest of the town of Hyampom. All fires burned in a mosaic of intensities; acres burned have been categorized into high, moderate and low severity based on RAVG data1. The great majority of the areas that burned at moderate and high severity had conifer forest cover prior to the fires (other acres were brush, grasslands or oak woodlands). The acres of conifer and mixed conifer that burned at high severity generally have no live trees remaining, and the areas that burned at moderate severity also have a high likelihood of deforestation or large pockets of mortality due to fire-injury (Table 1-1). Many trees showing signs of live branches or tops immediately following the fire will be lost due to cambium death or secondary mortality from insects compounded by years of drought. Table 1-1 Acreages and burn severities for fires that burned on the Shasta-Trinity and Six Rivers National Forests during 2015. Fire Name  Total Acreage  Total Acreage of Shasta-Trinity NF System Lands  Acres High and Moderate Burn Severity  Acres Low and Very Low Burn Severity  Fork Complex  36,934  33,458  11,217  25,717  South Complex  29,639  27,112  7,126  22,513  Mad River Complex  37,998  5,068  8,542  29,456  Route Complex  36,308  6,520  7,806  28,502  River Complex  78,694  71,117  17,097  61,597  Saddle Fire  1,672  1,150  756  916  Total  221,245  144,450  52,544  168,701  1 Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire (RAVG) products provide information that can assist post-fire vegetation management planning, and are generated by a change detection process using two Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite images captured before and after a wildfire. The algorithm uses the Relative Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR), which is sensitive to vegetation mortality resulting from the wildfire event. Figure 1-1 Map of 2015 Fire Complexes The areas affected by the 2015 wildfires include vegetation along 391 miles of road (359 miles of National Forest System roads, 32 miles administered by state and county).2 Of these 391 miles, 248 miles are open to the public (including Forest Service system roads and county and state roads). Of these 248 miles of open roads, 233 miles of Forest Service system, county and state roads travel through Shasta-Trinity National Forest lands. The vegetation along these roads experienced wildfire at varying degrees of intensity. Forested lands experiencing moderate and high intensity fire has resulted in a substantial number of dead and dying trees within reach of these roads. Structural integrity of fire-killed trees has been compromised and it is expected many of them will fall during a wind or storm event. Especially considering the steep topography, many of these trees are likely to fall into open roads, resulting in a risk to public health and safety. Current conditions within the burned area differ from the desired condition as identified in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan; USDA Forest Service, 1995). Trees that were killed by the fire pose a hazard to the public and forest workers visiting, traveling, and working in these areas. As these snags (standing dead trees) age, they become less stable and increase the risk to all forest users. Once these snags are on the ground, combined with the dead brush, fire behavior is likely to increase. Because of the increased fire behavior and the risk posed by hazard trees, suppression strategies would be limited. In addition, many areas that burned at moderate to high severity have lost the existing forest cover. When mature trees are killed due to fire and/or secondary mortality as a result of the fire, the forest stand loses the seed source needed to naturally regenerate back to conifer. Even if there is a conifer seed source in an area, spatial arrangement is highly clustered (Crotteau et al. 2013) and woody shrubs are very likely to dominate the deforested site for a very long time (i.e., over 100 years). Dominance of woody shrubs reduces the potential for forests to grow (McDonald and Abbott 1997). This adversely impacts a stand’s resistance to fire, rates of succession, carbon sequestration, growth of wood fiber, wildlife habitat, and other ecological and social values associated with mature forests. Purpose and Need for Action__________________ Within areas experiencing large scale disturbance on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in 2015 due to wildfire, the purpose of this project is to: 1. Mitigate hazards (i.e. fire-killed or defective trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. 2. Sustain and establish forest cover; and, 3. Capture economic value and support the economies of local communities by providing forest products. Based on the Land and Resource Management Plan for the Shasta-Trinity National Forests (1995) and post fire assessment, we have identified a need to: • Provide for public safety and protection of structures by managing natural and activity fuel loading, distribution and arrangement within Wildland Urban Interface for low flame lengths and rate of spread (Forest Plan 4-18); • Remove danger/hazard trees (FSH 7709.59 Section 41.7; Forest Plan 4-26); • Reduce surplus activity fuels that remain after meeting wildlife, riparian, soil and other environmental needs (Forest Plan 4-17); • Manage the fuel loading distribution and arrangement of natural and activity fuels adjacent to roads for low flame lengths and low rate of spread; • Create conditions that will support the restoration of fire to its natural role in the ecosystem (Forest Plan 4-4). • Quickly recover the monetary value of wood through salvage and sale, where feasible and appropriate, to provide economic stimulus to local communities (Forest Plan 45). • Implement reforestation activities following wildfire (Forest Plan 4-149, 4-153, 4157, 4-161). 2 These road mileage numbers refer to National Forest System roads; this does not include unauthorized routes that may be used by the public. Proposed Action ____________________________ The action proposed by the Forest Service to meet the purpose and need includes: hazard tree abatement (dropping of dead trees), fuel loading reduction, utilization of logs (e.g. through a commercial salvage sale), and tree planting in a 300-foot buffer along 233 miles of roads open to the public within the areas that burned in the 2015 wildfires (see Appendix A for a roads list). Width of the buffer on either side of the road could vary but would not exceed 300 feet; e.g. if conditions lend to a wider treatment on the uphill side, the uphill side may be treated up to 275 feet from the road and the downhill side would be treated 25 feet from the road. The minimum treatment area along either side of the road will be 25 feet. The maximum area of treatment is approximately 8,000 acres. Utilization of logs (e.g. through a commercial salvage sale) would occur wherever possible. The proposed action is described in more detail in Chapter 2 under Alternative 1, page 14. Decision Framework _________________________ Given the purpose and need, the deciding official will review the proposed action, the other alternatives, and their environmental consequences, in order to determine whether to implement the proposed action as described, select a different alternative, or take no action at this time. Management Direction _______________________ Management direction includes Forest Plan direction as well as other laws and regulations that apply to this project, including the Endangered Species Act and the 2001 Roadless Rule. Forest Plan direction includes designated land allocations. The project area is considered to be all National Forest Lands within the fire perimeters. Table 1-2 describes land allocations and other designations in the project area and Proposed Action treatments. Forest Plan Direction The Proposed Action and alternatives are guided by the Forest Plan. The Forest Plan provides programmatic management direction for site-specific projects. Goals and Standards and Guidelines apply to all land allocations and were considered when developing this project. Goals and Standards and Guidelines that apply include: Goals Management of the Forests’ transportation system to facilitate resource management activities, protect wildlife, meet water quality objectives and provide recreational access (page 4-4). Implement practices designed to maintain or improve the health and vigor of timber stands, consistent with the ecosystem needs of other resources (page 4-5). Provide a sustained yield of timber and other wood products to help support the economic structure of local communities and to supply regional and national needs (page 4-5). Restore fire to its natural role in the ecosystem when establishing the Desired Future Condition of the landscape. (page 4-4). Table 1-2 Area, by land allocation or designation, within the Project Area and proposed for treatment under the Proposed Action.

Natural fuels4 will be treated in the following order of priority: (1) public safety; (2) high investment situations (structural improvements, powerlines, plantations, etc.); (3) known high fire occurrence areas; and (4) coordinated resource benefits… (page 4-18). Provide for diversity of tree species indigenous to an area, in the course of conducting reforestation activities, by one or more of the following: 1) plant an appropriate mix of tree species in areas to be artificially regenerated 3 Those fuels created by the proposed treatments. 4 Existing fuels already on the landscape prior to proposed treatments. 2) encourage the regeneration of shade tolerant and intolerant tree species in areas to be naturally regenerated; and 3) leave manageable, salvable, and suitable residual advanced reproduction in areas planned for regeneration cutting. (Forest Plan 4-27) Land Allocations Land allocations in which treatments are proposed include: Late Successional Reserves, Matrix, Riparian Reserve, Adaptive Management Area, and Administratively Withdrawn. Late Successional Reserve (LSR) Late Successional Reserves are to be managed to protect and enhance conditions of late-successional and old-growth forest ecosystems, which serve as habitat for late-successional and old-growth related species including the northern spotted owl. These reserves are designed to maintain functional, interacting, late-successional, and old-growth forest ecosystem (Forest Plan 4-37). The Corral, South Fork, and Chanchelulla LSRs were impacted by the 2015 wildfires. General management direction for LSR lands is found on pages 4-37 through 4-44 of the Forest Plan. Supplemental direction may be found in the Shasta-Trinity’s Forest-Wide Late-successional Reserve Assessment (USDA Forest Service 1999; LSRA). Forest-Wide LSRA As directed by the Northwest Forest Plan Record of Decision Standards and Guidelines (page C-11), the Shasta-Trinity National Forest prepared a Forest-wide LSRA in 1999. The LSRA’s Chapter 4 includes Activity Design Criterion #7 Fuel Reduction (primarily dead and down) for which the objective is to remove dead and dying trees in order to protect the remaining existing and developing late-successional habitat and to facilitate the development of reforested areas toward late-successional conditions following a stand-replacing event. This criterion applies to areas greater than 10-acres that have received a stand-replacing event (such as wildfire) resulting in a canopy closure of less than 40%, and includes the following treatment standards: b. All standing live trees should be retained, including those injured (e.g., scorched) but likely to survive; c. Following stand-replacing disturbance, management should focus on retaining snags that are likely to persist until late-successional conditions have developed and the new stand is again producing large snags. The biomass left in snags can be credited toward the amount of coarse woody debris biomass needed to achieve management objectives; and d. Removal of snags and logs may be necessary to reduce hazards to humans along roads and trails, and in or adjacent to campgrounds. Where materials must be removed from the site, as in a campground or on a road, a salvage sale is appropriate. In other areas, such as along roads, leaving material on site may be considered. Matrix The purpose of this prescription is to provide for an area where there is moderate evidence of the sights and sounds of humans, and to obtain an optimum timber yield of wood fiber products from productive forest lands within the context of ecosystem management. This prescription emphasizes recreational opportunities associated with developed road systems and dispersed and developed camp sites. Fish and wildlife management which supports the recreational use of wildlife species (hunting, fishing and viewing) is also emphasized. Timber stands will be managed to obtain optimum growth and yields using cultural practices which control competing vegetation, obtain stocking control and minimize mortality. Vegetation manipulation will provide habitat for those wildlife species primarily dependent on early and mid-seral stages (Forest Plan 4-65 and 4-67). Adaptive Management Areas The overall objective for AMA is to learn how to manage forests on an ecosystem basis in terms of both technical and social challenges, and in a manner consistent with applicable laws. The AMAs are intended to contribute substantially to the achievement of objectives for these standards and guidelines as they appear to other allocations. This includes provision of well-distributed late successional habitat outside of the reserves, retention of key structural elements of late-successional forests on lands subjected to regeneration harvest and restoration and protection of riparian zones as well as provision of a stable timber supply (Forest Plan 4-69). Riparian Reserves Riparian Reserves are to maintain and restore the distribution, diversity and complexity of watershed and landscape-scale features to ensure protection of the aquatic systems to which species, populations and communities are uniquely adapted. Prescriptions within Riparian Reserves are also to be consistent with the other eight Aquatic Conservation Strategy Objectives for riparian health maintenance and enhancement (Forest Plan 4-58). The Riparian Reserve designation overlays the other land allocations including LSR and Matrix, and generally are designated within 300 feet of both sides of the high water levels on perennial fish-bearing streams or 150 feet of both sides of high levels for perennial non-fish bearing streams and 100 feet for intermittent/ephemeral streams that display annual scour. Direction for management of Riparian Reserves is found in the Forest Plan (pages 4-53 through 4-60) and the Northwest Forest Plan Record of Decision (pages C30 through C38). Management activities may occur in Riparian Reserves when they are in support of or do not adversely affect maintenance of riparian-dependent resources (i.e. fish, wildlife and water). Administratively Withdrawn – Unroaded non-motorized recreation The purpose of this prescription is to provide for semi-primitive non-motorized recreation opportunities in unroaded areas outside existing Wildernesses while maintaining predominantly natural-appearing areas with only subtle modifications. Also emphasized in this prescription is retention of old-growth vegetation and management of wildlife species requiring late seral stage conditions. This prescription also applies to designated Wild segments of Wild and Scenic Rivers outside of Wildernesses (Forest Plan 4-45). Administratively Withdrawn – Limited Roaded Motorized Recreation The purpose of this prescription is to provide for semi-primitive motorized recreation opportunities, while maintaining predominantly natural-appearing areas with some modifications. Recreational and visual resources are important values; semi-primitive activities are emphasized. Managing for old-growth vegetation and wildlife species requiring late seral stages is also an important consideration (Forest Plan 4-46). This prescription also applies to designated Scenic segments of Wild and Scenic River. Inventoried Roadless Areas Inventoried roadless areas were designated in the 2001 Roadless Rule (66 Fed. Reg. 3272-3273 (Jan 12, 2001)). This designation is meant to provide for semi-primitive non-motorized recreation opportunities in unroaded areas on National Forest lands outside existing Wildernesses, while maintaining predominantly natural-appearing areas with only subtle modifications. Special recreational and visual values, fisheries and riparian resources are emphasized. Under the 2001 Roadless Rule, timber may not be cut, sold, or removed in inventoried roadless areas of the National Forest System unlessthe Responsible Official determines that one of the following circumstances exists (the cutting, sale, or removal of timber in these areas is expected to be infrequent): 1. The cutting, sale, or removal of generally small diameter timber is needed for one of the following purposes and will maintain or improve one or more of the roadless area characteristics as defined in Subpart B of the 2001 Roadless Rule. (i) To improve threatened, endangered, proposed, or sensitive species habitat; or (ii) To maintain or restore the characteristics of ecosystem composition and structure, such as to reduce the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire effects, within the range of variability that would be expected to occur under natural disturbance regimes of the current climatic period. 2. The cutting, sale, or removal of timber is incidental to the implementation of a management activity not otherwise prohibited by the subpart. Examples of these activities include but are not limited to removal of hazard trees adjacent to classified roads for public health and safety reasons, fire line construction for wildland fire suppression or control of prescribed fire. Also, hazardous fuels treatment in inventoried roadless area is not prohibited by this rule, so long as road construction or reconstruction is not necessary (66 Fed. Reg 3273). Endangered Species Act – Northern Spotted Owl The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides for the conservation of threatened and endangered plants and animals. Under the ESA, the Forest Service is required to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to ensure that actions that the Forest Service undertakes or authorizes are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any species listed as threatened or endangered. As part of implementing the ESA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to develop Recovery Plans and Critical Habitat for threatened and endangered species. The Shasta-Trinity contains areas that provide suitable habitat for the threatened northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina), and Critical Habitat for the northern spotted owl has been designated on the Forest. Designated Critical HabitatThe Critical Habitat Rule for the northern spotted owl (NSO) identifies geographic areas that contain features deemed essential for conservation of the northern spotted owl. The revised Critical Habitat Rule (USFWS 2012) updated habitat unit and subunit boundaries that had been established by the 2008 rule, across the range of the northern spotted owl. The areas of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest impacted by the 2015 wildfires includes 93,588 acres of northern spotted owl Critical Habitat (as designated by the 2012 Critical Habitat Rule) that burned at various intensities. While designated Critical Habitat, it is important to note that some areas within Critical Habitat Units are not suitable NSO habitat. Also, wildfire may have reduced the suitability of Critical Habitat for owls both now and in the long term—especially within areas that burned at high severity. Public Involvement __________________________ A Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project was published in the Federal Register on November 24, 2015. The notice asked that comments on the proposed action be received by December 24, 2015. The scoping letter went out to over 800 adjacent landowners, interested public, regulatory agencies, and tribes. The Forest Service received a total of 22 comment letters and emails during the scoping period. The comments were submitted by the Trinity County Collaborative, representatives of the timber industry, the Environmental Protection Agency, members of the public from local communities, and conservation organizations including Klamath Siskiyou Wildlands Center, Environmental Protection Information Center, Conservation Congress, Citizens for Better Forestry, Safe Alternatives for our Forest Environment, and Wild Nature Institute. Shortly after fire suppression efforts were complete, initial public involvement began with public meetings, including meetings with the Trinity County Collaborative Forestry Subgroup (the Collaborative). Some of these meetings occurred in cooperation with the Six Rivers National Forest. The early meetings simply discussed the existing conditions after fire effects and potential opportunities. The Collaborative provided their “From Fire Killed to Fuelbreaks” proposal shortly after these meetings occurred. The Forest interdisciplinary team (IDT) added detail to the Collaborative’s proposal and initiated scoping with that as the proposed action. During the public scoping period, in the first week of December, five public meetings were held in local communities (Mad River, Hayfork, Hyampom, Weaverville, and Burnt Ranch) throughout Humboldt and Trinity Counties. Issues _____________________________________ The IDT reviewed comments from the public and other agencies in order to identify key issues. Issues are statements of cause and effect, linking environmental effects to actions (FSH 1909.15 Ch. 12.41). Issues serve to highlight effects or unintended consequences that may occur from the proposed action and alternatives, giving opportunities during the analysis to reduce adverse effects and compare trade-offs for the decision maker and public to understand (FSH 1909.15 Ch. 12.42). Key issues have been utilized to develop alternatives (alternative-driving issues) or analyze alternatives (analysis-driving issues) (FSH 1909.15 Ch. 12.4). Comments and concerns were assigned to one of the following categories. Similar issues were grouped by subject matter. 1. Alternative-Driving Issue (key issue): Alternative-driving issues generally concern resources that may be impacted by implementation of the proposed action and cannot be completely resolved through project design. An alternative-driving issue is addressed by developing and analyzing an alternative to the proposed action or by creating a modification to the proposed action. Such modifications may take the form of resource protection measures or mitigation measures that are applied to the proposed action as well as multiple alternatives. If a new alternative is created, it may be analyzed fully or, if it does not meet the purpose and need, is illegal, is based on inadequate scientific evidence or is sufficiently similar to an alternative already considered in detail, the alternative will not be considered in detail. Some alternative-driving issues are also analysis-driving issues, as described below. 2. Analysis-Driving Issue (key issue): Analysis-driving issues relate to a cause and effect relationship between the proposed action and its effects. They suggest a method to measure effects and identify potential effects caused by the proposed action that are relevant to the decision to be made and suggest how important or ‘significant’ an effect might be. Analysis issues are carried through effects analyses by project specialists. Analysis issues will be analyzed in the project effects portion of environmental impact documentation. 3. Procedural Concern (non-key issue): These are issues that may be addressed through implementation of standard design features, or completion of processes routinely conducted by the IDT. It is common to receive scoping comments reminding the agency to consider or conduct certain processes, such as consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or cumulative effects analyses. Procedural concerns may also address the methodology behind the analysis and why it is appropriate. For example, the analysis may include the use of a model or qualitative discussion of key resource characteristics based on professional expertise. 4. Other concern (non-key issue). Other concerns are designated as such for any of the following reasons: The issue is beyond the scope of the project. The issue does not meet the purpose and need for action, falls outside of the project area, or is beyond the power of the agency to address. The issue is unrelated to the decision to be made. The issue is already decided or required by law, regulation, or policy. The issue is conjectural and not supported by scientific or factual evidence. The comment is general in nature, such as a position statement, and does not provide sufficient specific information which can be used to analyze effects. The comment asks a question that can be answered succinctly in the analysis document or in the response to comments. The comment requests a modification to the proposed action without explaining the environmental, social, or economic effect that such modification would address. Although not a true issue, these comments are carried forward to the alternative development stage. The comment has been resolved through inclusion of a project design feature or a resource protection measure. Statement of support. The responses to individual comments and associated reasoning for identifying issues is located in Appendix B of this document and is available on the project website at: http://www.fs.usda.gov/project/?project=48060. The project record resides at the Shasta-Trinity National Forest Headquarters office at 3644 Avtech Parkway, Redding, CA. The Forest Service identified the following alternative-driving issues from public scoping responses: 1. Removing dead trees will negatively impact native species, habitat, clean water and forest resources; therefore, include an alternative that does not include post-fire logging where it's not directly impacting busy roads. Addressed in Alternative 7. 2. Removal of burned trees would have a negative impact on northern spotted owls; therefore, analyze an alternative that would not remove burned trees in high value northern spotted owl areas. Addressed in Alternative 4 and 5. 3. Salvage logging has a negative impact on use of burned areas by northern spotted owls; therefore, consider an alternative that does not impact areas that would be used for post fire foraging by northern spotted owls. Addressed in Alternatives 4 and 5. 4. The project could have a negative impact on northern spotted owl habitat; therefore, an alternative should be considered that minimizes or eliminates impacts to northern spotted owls. Addressed in Alternatives 4 and 5. 5. Treatments in Inventoried Roadless Areas would affect the natural environment and could have a negative impact on Threatened, Endangered, and Sensitive species; therefore, consider an alternative that does not treat in IRAs. Addressed in Alternative 5. 6. The proposed action does not fully address the hazard tree conditions; therefore, an alternative should be considered that allows a wider treatment buffer where necessary to address the hazard. Addressed in Alternative 3. 7. Future high severity fire is a concern in the project area which will not be addressed by the proposed action; therefore, analyze an alternative that includes effective fuelbreaks, including treatments of green vegetation and maintenance. Addressed in Alternative 2. 8. The proposed action should do more to address traveler safety along roads; therefore, analyze an alternative that includes silvicultural treatments (including thinning green vegetation) downhill from treated roads. Addressed in Alternative 2. 9. The proposed action is should do more to address traveler safety along roads during fires; therefore, analyze an alternative that includes wider treatments, especially downhill from treated roads. Addressed in Alternative 3. 10. The proposed action would leave felled hazard trees outside the treatment buffer, which leads to heavy fuel loading; therefore, consider an alternative with a wider treatment buffer that would allow all felled hazard trees to be removed. Addressed in Alternative 3. 11. The proposed action would only remove trees that are dead at the time of implementation, but this does not address all of the trees that will die from fire damage, which means the treatments do not fully address the hazard; analyze an alternative that would remove dying trees as well as dead trees, consistent with the Region 5 Hazard Tree Guidelines and the Region 5 Fire Injured Tree Guidelines. Addressed in Alternatives 2 and 3. 12. The Limited Operating Periods (LOPs) impact ability to implement salvage treatments; therefore, consider an alternative that does not include LOPs. Addressed in Alternative 8. 13. The proposed planting density is lower than recommended for future timber management; therefore, analyze an alternative that would have a heavier planting density. Addressed in Alternative 2. 14. The project could negatively impact watersheds that are already over the threshold of concern; therefore, consider an alternative that minimizes treatments in those watersheds. Addressed in Alternative 5. 15. Machine piling has a negative impact on soils; therefore, analyze an alternative that would not include machine piling. Addressed in Alternative 5. 16. Logging has a negative impact in Riparian Reserves; therefore, analyze an alternative that does not include logging in Riparian Reserves. Addressed in Alternative 5. The Forest Service identified the following analysis-driving issues from scoping responses: 1. Project activities will produce sediment that could reach streams; therefore, estimate the quantity of sediment delivery. 2. The proposed action will generate CO2 emissions; therefore, estimate CO2 emissions for each alternative.  CHAPTER 2 – ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING THE PROPOSED ACTION Introduction ________________________________ This chapter describes and compares the alternatives considered for the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project. It describes alternatives considered in detail and those eliminated from detailed study. The end of this chapter presents the alternatives in tabular format so that the alternatives and their environmental impacts can be readily compared. Alternatives Considered in Detail ______________ Based on the issues identified through public comment on the proposed action, the Forest Service developed four alternative proposals that achieve the purpose and need differently than the proposed action. In addition, the Forest Service is required to analyze a No Action alternative. The proposed action, alternatives and no action alternative are described in detail below. Actions Common to all Action Alternatives (Alternatives 15) Hazard trees have the potential to cause property damage, personal injury or fatality in the event of a failure. Hazard trees will be felled (mechanically or by hand) on National Forest System (NFS) lands along 233 miles of roads open to the public (i.e. open NFS roads, county roads and state highways) that burned during the 2015 wildfire season. Hazard trees5will be felledalong all open roads in all alternatives. However, differences between alternatives include criteria utilized for identification of hazards and level of fuel reduction treatments prescribed to treat (or not treat) felled trees. Open roads crossing NFS lands identified for treatment include: -153 miles of NFS Maintenance Level 2 (accessible with high clearance vehicles) roads; -34 miles of NFS Maintenance Level 3 (accessible with passenger cars) roads; -19 miles of NFS Maintenance Level 4 (paved) roads; and -27 miles of state and county roads. Treatments common to all alternatives include: • Create a control line on the outside edge of treatment areas where necessary to maintain fuel reductions with prescribed fire. • Where appropriate, stumps of freshly cut conifers over 14-inches in diameter will be treated with an EPA-registered borate compound to prevent spread of Heterobasidion root disease. • Trees or snags that are imminent hazards to the road and/or operations would be felled; those that are not dead at the time of implementation or are felled outside the treatment buffer would be left onsite. • Personal-use firewood gathering of felled trees or other down wood would be allowed 5 Hazard Tree Guidelines for Forest Service Roads and Facilities in the Pacific Southwest Region (Angwin et al 2012) will be utilized to assess hazard trees. where normally permitted. No treatments are proposed within Wilderness. The fires burned with variable intensity throughout the fire footprints. Areas within the road buffer that burned at low severity may need very little or no treatment. As a result, treatments will be uncommon and will occur intermittently within areas that burned at low severity. However, where treatments are necessary and merchantable material remains, fuels treatments and small salvage sales may be utilized within these intermittent zones. Alternative 1 -The Proposed Action Dead trees and vegetation will be treated utilizing up to a 300-foot wide (plus width of road bed) total buffer on National Forest System (NFS) lands along 233 miles (approximately 8,000 acres) of roads open to the public (i.e. open NFS roads, county roads, and state highways) that burned during the 2015 wildfire season. Width of the buffer on either side of the road could change but would not exceed 275 feet; e.g. if conditions lend to a wider treatment on the uphill side, the uphill side may be treated up to 275 feet from the road and the downhill side would be treated at least 25 feet from the road. The minimum treatment area along either side of the road will be 25 feet. Alternative 1 is the preferred alternative. Maps for Alternative 1 can be found in Appendix F on pages F-4 to F-8. Roadside treatments Treatments along open public roads (identified above) are designed to improve public and firefighter safety by reducing the number of fire-induced hazards along roads and reducing excessive fuels within the treatment buffer. Treatments along these roads include: 1. Remove or treat only dead6vegetation(using one of the treatment types listed below) within the treatment buffer. Dead vegetation will be identified at the time of treatment. Treatment types could include: a. Mechanical or hand felling and removal of trees utilizing ground or cable logging systems. Trees that must be felled for safety reasons that occur outside of the 300 foot buffer would be left on site. b. Utilize wood products whenever possible. Utilization can include salvage logs, commercial firewood, biomass removal, etc. i. Commercial timber sales (sawlogs) are proposed on approximately 128 segmented miles of the roads (approximately 4,100 acres, displayed in yellow on project maps) proposed for treatment. Along 105 miles, wood utilization would occur intermittently and the expected volume is substantially lower within this area (displayed in cyan on project maps). ii. No new roads will be constructed. Access ramps (less than 100 feet in length) may be utilized to access existing or newly constructed landings. Ramps will be decommissioned following use. c. Fuels Treatments: Reduction of fuel loading to 10-20 tons/acre. Dead brush will be reduced by 50-100%. Within areas that burned with low severity, reduction of fuel loading will be intermittent (displayed in cyan on project maps).  Within areas that burned with medium to high severity, fuel reduction treatments would be more 6 No green limbs at time of implementation. extensive (displayed in yellow on project maps). The following methods may be used to reduce the fuel load: i. Hand felling, i.e. cutting trees and/or brush using hand tools such as a chainsaw. ii. Mastication, i.e. pulverizes or chops standing trees and logs into small particles, redistributing surface fuels. This treatment can include mowing, mulching, or chipping. iii. Lopping woody debris (slash) and scattering around the treated area, i.e. redistributing woody material. iv. Pruning which removes lower limbs up to 10 feet from the ground. v. Hand piling slash involves the concentration of slash and surface fuels in small piles. vi. Machine piling slash utilizes equipment to pile slash and surface fuels into larger piles. vii. Pile burning. viii. Jackpot burning which would burn heavy intermittent fuel concentrations, where fuels are not sufficiently continuous to carry a broadcast fire. ix. Broadcast burning where heavy continuous fuel concentrations exist. 2. Provide for future forest cover within the treatment buffer through planting, utilizing a species composition consistent with historic conditions, with spacing between seedlings of 18 to 30 feet. Fuel Treatment Maintenance After the initial entry, vegetation will continue to grow, and trees will continue to succumb to fire damage and subsequent insect and disease and fall to the ground. These processes contribute to increasing fuel loading along roads once the initial implementation is complete. In order to sustain the desired condition as it relates to hazard mitigation, follow-up treatments may be necessary to maintain fuel loading levels between 10-20 tons/acre. Conditions will be evaluated and prescribed within 15 years following implementation. Maintenance treatments would be restricted to the following treatment types: • Prescribed burning (broadcast, jackpot, underburn, piles); • Felling of hazard trees; and • Hand piling excess fuels. Alternative 2 – Consistent Buffer and Fuelbreaks Alternative Dead and dying trees and other vegetation will be treated utilizing a consistent 300-foot wide (150 feet on either side of the road, plus width of road bed) buffer on NFS lands along 217 miles (approximately 7,300 acres) of roads open to the public (i.e. open NFS roads, county roads, and state highways) that burned during the 2015 wildfire season. In addition, 16 miles of strategically located fuelbreaks (approximately 2,200 acres) have been identified along eight roads (3N10, 4N04, 4N24, 4N12, 5N04, 5N13, 5N60 and 6N04). This alternative responds to alternative driving issues, numbers 6-9 and 11.  Maps for Alternative 2 can be found in Appendix F on pages F-9 to F-13. Roadside treatments Treatments along open public roads are designed to improve public and firefighter safety by reducing the number of fire-induced hazards along roads and reducing excessive fuels within the treatment buffer. Treatment methods are consistent with the Roadside Treatments described for the Proposed Action (Alternative 1) except: • Remove or treat dying vegetation (using one of the treatment types listed in Alternative 1) in addition to dead vegetation. Dying trees would be identified utilizing a probability of mortality of 0.6.7 • Treatments would occur within a consistent 300-foot total width buffer. Width of the buffer on either side of the road would equal 150 feet. • Commercial timber sales (sawlogs) are proposed on approximately 128 segmented miles of the roads (approximately 5,300 acres) proposed for treatment (displayed in yellow on project maps). Along 105 miles, wood utilization would occur intermittently and the expected volume is substantially lower within this area (displayed in cyan on project maps). • Provide for future forest cover through planting, utilizing a species composition consistent with historic conditions, with spacing between seedlings of 15 to 30 feet. • Approximately 2 miles of existing unauthorized roads may be utilized as temporary roads to access existing or new landings. Unauthorized roads utilized will be decommissioned after completion of project activities. Fuelbreaks Fuelbreak treatments will create new fuelbreaks along approximately 16 miles of existing open roads (3N10, 4N04, 4N24, 4N12, 5N04, 5N13, 5N60 and 6N04). Treatment width will extend 600 feet from either side of the road, for a total width of approximately 1,200 feet. The fuelbreak area overlays roads identified for roadside hazard tree and fuels treatments, and would be treated utilizing the same methods of treatment as identified for in Alternative 1 above. In addition to the treatments described in Alternative 1, treatment within the fuelbreak would vary by distance from the road, and would include the following modifications: Remove or treat live and dead vegetation. Treatments could include: Thinning live trees up to 10” diameter at breast height (DBH), by hand felling, with the target of the following canopy covers depending upon distance from the road: 0-200’ from road will be thinned to a minimum 40% canopy cover 8; 201-400’ from road will be thinned to a minimum 60% canopy cover; and 401-600’ from road will be thinned to a minimum 80% canopy cover. Pruning, which raises canopy base heights. 0-200’ from road will be pruned to a maximum 10’canopy base height; 201-400’ from road will be pruned to a maximum 8’canopy base height; and 401-600’ from road will be pruned to a maximum 6’canopy base height. Utilize wood products whenever possible. Utilization can include salvage logs, commercial or personal firewood, biomass removal, etc. 7 As identified in Hazard Tree Guidelines for Forest Service Roads and Facilities in the Pacific Southwest Region (Angwin et al 2012) and utilizing Marking Guidelines for Fire Injured Trees in California (Smith and Cluck 2011). 8 Canopy cover percentages pertain to the entire canopy, not just the 10” DBH cohort that is being thinned. • Commercial timber sales (sawlogs) are expected to be feasible along approximately 14 segmented miles (approximately 1,300 additional acres) of the roads proposed for fuelbreak treatment. Additional sales would be considered outside of these miles. • As is true within the Roadside Treatments, dead and dying trees would be removed within the entire treatment area, even when they do not pose a hazard to a road. • Less than 1 mile of new temporary road construction may be constructed within fuelbreak buffer to aid in tree removal, and decommissioned after completion of project activities. Fuel Treatment Maintenance After the initial entry, vegetation will continue to grow, and trees will continue to succumb to fire damage and subsequent insect and disease and fall to the ground. These processes contribute to increasing fuel loading along roads once the initial implementation is complete. In order to sustain the desired condition as it relates to hazard mitigation, follow-up treatments may be necessary to maintain fuel loading levels between 10-20 tons/acre. Conditions will be evaluated and prescribed within 15 years following implementation. Maintenance treatments would occur within Roadside Treatments and Fuelbreaks.  Maintenance treatments would be restricted to the following treatment types: Prescribed burning (broadcast, jackpot, underburn, piles) Hand piling excess fuels Hand felling of small trees and brush that have grown since implementation in the fuelbreak areas Felling and utilization of hazard trees. Alternative 3 – Wider Buffer Alternative Dead and dying trees and other vegetation will be treated utilizing up to a 600-foot wide (300 feet on either side of the road, plus width of road bed) buffer on NFS lands along 233 miles (approximately 15,200 acres) of roads open to the public (i.e. open NFS roads, county roads, and state highways) that burned during the 2015 wildfire season. This alternative responds to alternative-driving issues, numbers 6, 9-11 and 13.  Maps for Alternative 3 can be found in Appendix F on pages F-14 to F-18. Roadside treatments Treatments along open public roads are designed to improve public and firefighter safety by reducing the number of fire-induced hazards along roads and reducing excessive fuels.  Treatments would occur within a variable-width buffer not exceeding 600 feet, e.g. areas without hazardous trees due to steep slopes downhill of the road may have a narrower treatment. Treatment methods are consistent with the Roadside Treatments described for the Proposed Action (Alternative 1) except: • Remove or treat dying vegetation (using one of the treatment types listed in Alternative 1) in addition to dead vegetation. Vegetation would be removed within a buffer of up to a 600-foot total width. Width of the buffer on either side of the road would not exceed 300 feet. • Hazard trees would be identified utilizing a probability of mortality of 0.6. • Salvage of commercially viable saw logs is proposed on approximately 128 segmented miles of the roads (approximately 7,700 acres) proposed for treatment (displayed in yellow on project maps). Along 105 miles, wood utilization would occur intermittently and the expected volume is substantially lower within this area (displayed in cyan on project maps). • Up to 3 miles of existing unauthorized roads may be utilized as temporary roads to access existing or new landings. Unauthorized roads utilized will be decommissioned after completion of project activities. Fuel Treatment Maintenance After the initial entry, vegetation will continue to grow, and trees will continue to succumb to fire damage and subsequent insect and disease and fall to the ground. These processes contribute to increasing fuel loading along roads once the initial implementation is complete. In order to sustain the desired condition as it relates to hazard mitigation, follow-up treatments may be necessary to maintain fuel levels between 10-20 tons/acre. Conditions will be evaluated and prescribed within 15 years following implementation. Maintenance treatments would be restricted to the following treatment types: • Prescribed burning (broadcast, jackpot, underburn, piles) • Hand piling excess fuels • Felling and utilization of hazard trees. Alternative 4 – Northern Spotted Owl Alternative As described in Alternative 1, dead trees and vegetation will be felled within a variable 300-foot wide (plus width of road bed) total buffer on NFS lands along 233 miles (approximately 8,000 acres) of roads open to the public (i.e. open NFS roads, county roads, and state highways) that burned during the 2015 wildfire season. Roadside Treatments and Fuel Treatment Maintenance (consistent with treatments described in Alternative 1) would occur on approximately 5,840 acres along roads outside areas identified as important habitat for northern spotted owls. This alternative responds to alternative driving issues, numbers 2-4. Maps for Alternative 4 can be found in Appendix F on pages F-19 to F23. Roadside Treatments Treatments consistent with Roadside Treatments described in Alternative 1 would occur on approximately 5,840 acres along roads outside areas identified as important habitat for northern spotted owls. • Salvage of saw logs containing commercial value is proposed on approximately 20 segmented miles of the roads (approximately 780 acres) proposed for treatment (shown in cyan on project map). Along 155 miles (5,060 acres), there would be no salvage harvest. • Along 155 miles with no salvage treatments (5,060 acres), fuels treatments would occur (shown in cyan on project map). • As is the case for Roadside Treatments in Alternative 1, future forest cover within the treatment buffer would be provided through planting, utilizing a species composition consistent with historic conditions, with spacing between seedlings of 18 to 30 feet. Fuel Treatment Maintenance Maintenance treatments consistent with treatments described in Alternative 1 would occur on approximately 5,840 acres along roads outside areas identified as important habitat for northern spotted owls. Important Northern Spotted Owl HabitatHazard tree mitigation would occur along 58 miles of road on 2,100 acres identified as important habitat for northern spotted owls. These areas are those which consist of: -Suitable (nesting, roosting, foraging) and post-fire foraging habitat in northern spotted owl territories (1.3 miles from current and historic nesting sites); and -Suitable (nesting, roosting, foraging) and post-fire foraging habitat in northern spotted owl Critical Habitat. Within these areas, treatments would be limited to hazard tree mitigation. Hand felling trees identified as hazardous to the road or operations would be left on site: there would be no removal, no fuels reduction, and no maintenance treatments (shown in orange on the project maps).  However, tree planting would occur, utilizing a species composition consistent with historic conditions, with spacing between seedlings of 18 to 30 feet Alternative 5 – Minimum Impact Alternative Dead trees and vegetation will be treated within a variable 300-foot wide (plus width of road bed) total buffer on NFS lands along 233 miles (approximately 8,000 acres) of roads open to the public (i.e. open NFS roads, county roads, and state highways) that burned during the 2015 wildfire season. Roadside treatments and Fuel Treatment Maintenance (consistent with treatments described in Alternative 1) would occur on approximately 4,100 acres to reduce fuel loadings outside of sensitive areas, with the exception that no commercial timber sale removal or machine piling would be allowed in any treatment areas. This alternative responds to alternative driving issues, numbers 2-5 and 14-16. Maps for Alternative 5 can be found in Appendix F on pages F-24 to F-28. Roadside Treatments Roadside Treatments would occur on approximately 4,100 acres outside of certain sensitive areas (shown in cyan on project maps).  Treatments would be consistent with the Roadside Treatments described in Alternative 1 with following exceptions: • No commercial timber sale removal would occur • No machine piling would be allowed. As is true with the Roadside Treatments under Alternative 1, future forest cover would be restored through planting, utilizing a species composition consistent with historic conditions, with spacing between seedlings of 18 to 30 feet. Fuel Treatment Maintenance Maintenance treatments (consistent with treatments described in Alternative 1) would occur on approximately 4,100 acres along roads outside areas identified Sensitive Areas as described below. Sensitive Areas Hazard tree mitigation would occur on 3,900 acres identified as sensitive areas. These areas consist of: -All northern spotted owl suitable (nesting, roosting, foraging) and post-fire foraging habitat; -Riparian Reserves; -Inventoried Roadless Areas; and -At-risk watersheds. Within these areas, treatments would be limited to hazard tree mitigation. Hand felling trees identified as hazardous to the road or operations would be left on site: there would be no removal, no fuels reduction, and no maintenance treatments. However, tree planting would occur, utilizing a species composition consistent with historic conditions, with spacing between seedlings of 18 to 30 feet Alternative 6 – No Action Under the No Action alternative, current management plans would continue to guide management of the project area. No hazard mitigation would be implemented to accomplish the purpose and need. Connected Actions Connected actions are those actions that are closely related and therefore should be analyzed in the same document. Actions are connected if they automatically trigger other actions which may require environmental analysis, cannot or will not proceed unless other actions are taken previously or simultaneously, or are interdependent parts of a larger action and depend on the larger action for their justification (CEQ Regulations Section 1508.25). The connected actions that are considered in this analysis are road construction, reconstruction, and maintenance; restoration; temporary road use; and use and creation of landings. Road Treatments The project proposes no new permanent road construction. Existing National Forest Transportation System roads may receive reconstruction and maintenance activities to bring some sections of road up to Forest Service standards to protect resources, safely and efficiently accommodate machine and worker access, and provide for removal of forest products. These road improvements, where they occur on system roads that are open to the public, would secondarily provide safer roads for public use. Commercial treatments may require larger vehicles and more frequent trips to haul material off-site; these roads may receive additional maintenance or reconstruction. Road use for non-commercial hazard reduction treatments would generally be limited to foot traffic or light vehicles (pickup trucks and off-highway vehicles). Mechanical fuels reduction treatments would include equipment traveling on roads where possible to reduce impacts, and otherwise may require masticators and equipment utilized for machine-piling along road corridors and within analyzed buffer widths. The project also proposes downgrading 1.6 miles of National Forest System road 31N49 from a Maintenance Level 2 road (open) to a Maintenance Level 1 road (closed). All of the action alternatives would include closing this road. This road has been identified as having safety concerns inherent in design and is disproportionately contributing sedimentation to waterways due to its proximity to the stream bed. Downgrading the maintenance level would be implemented by blocking access with a barrier after storm-proofing. As this action does not remove the road from the National Forest Road System, existing permitted uses would be maintained. A list of roads planned for use during implementation of the project is included in Appendix A. Road Maintenance Maintenance preserves the function of the road but generally does not include improvements. Maintenance generally includes: blading; brushing; felling and removal of roadside hazard trees; repair and/or replacement of road surfaces; cleaning, repair, or installation of drainage structures such as culverts, ditches, and dips; dust abatement; removal and installation of closure barriers, and installation or repair of signs. Maintenance activities generally do not disturb ground outside the existing roadway (toe of fill to top of cut) other than removal of material around culvert inlets. Road maintenance activities may occur on all open roads administered by the Forest Service in connection with implementation of this project. This includes NFS roads within the fire footprint as well as those planned for utilization as haul routes for log removal outside the fire footprint, approximately 247 miles of road. Reconstruction Road reconstruction would occur as necessary for safe and efficient passage.  Road reconstruction to treat existing sediment sources was made a condition of our Waiver by the North Coast Water Quality Control Board. 9 Reconstruction generally includes work to improve and restore roads. Improvements would provide for serviceability for public use as well as project haul vehicles and logging equipment, proper hydrologic function, and stream protection, in accordance with applicable Best Management Practices (BMPs). General goals include storm-proofing to reduce the potential for road erosion and sedimentation and to help protect riparian and aquatic resources while protecting the road surface and improving public safety. Storm-proofing reduces stream diversion potential and minimizes potential fill volume loss at crossings by insuring that if a pipe or culvert is compromised, any overflow would be directed to an area that is well armored and away from fill material. Actions can include surface improvement; construction of drainage dips to disperse concentrated surface flows; upgrading and replacing undersized, worn or damaged culverts to withstand 100-year peak flows and/or debris flows; constructing riprap fills or other drainage or stabilization features with potential disturbance outside the established roadway (toe of fill to top of cut); construction of low water crossings (native surface or designed/hardened); construction of fish passage crossings utilizing natural bottom design; realignment; widening to accommodate vehicles/equipment or when increasing the size of a culvert; and widening of curves as needed to accommodate off-tracking of log trucks and chip vans. Reconstruction also includes the actions included in the Road Maintenance category above such as culvert replacement, depending on stream conditions (i.e. wet). Reconstruction would improve the road conditions as needed for haul of forest products. Generally, reconstruction is focused around perennial stream crossings or near adjacent perennial waterways. Specifically, this project includes 47 culvert replacements or upgrades, 1 natural bottom fish passage crossing and one designed low water crossing, which would occur under all action alternatives. See Appendix D for more road actions. Restoration Approximately 4.7 miles of non-system (i.e. unauthorized) routes in Hyampom and Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat watersheds would be hydrologically restored under alternative 1 in order to reduce watershed impacts in these already sensitive watersheds that experienced substantial wildfire effects.10 Restoration of these routes would include installing native material barriers made of log, earth, or rock. Beyond the closure, measures would be implemented as necessary to reduce sediment delivery from the road surface to make it hydrologically neutral. Hydrologic restoration of roads includes measures such as partial recontouring11, loosening compacted soils, and removing all structures such as stream crossing pipes, over-side drains, trash racks, drop inlets, etc. (USDA Forest Service, 2011). Limited sections may be fully recontoured where it is economically feasible or necessary to camouflage a route where barriers or gates are likely to be ineffective. Cross drain pipes may be left in place (with the inlet crushed). Exceptions may occur where removing a pipe involves adverse effects which outweigh environmental benefits. Best Management Practices for Road Actions Road construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be implemented for any roadwork for the project to ensure proper drainage and control of road related sediment. A list of the BMPs relevant to this project is available in Appendix C. Roads used for project implementation must meet Forest Service BMP standards and where necessary would be watered for dust abatement, or dust abated through the use of a Forest approved dust palliative (suppressant). 9Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements for Nonpoint Source Discharges Related to Certain Federal Land Management Activities on NFS Lands in the North Coast Region. 10 The miles of road restoration would vary under the other action alternatives and can be found in the Physical Sciences Report. 11 Partial recontouring retains a portion of the old roadbed in a gently outsloped condition. LandingsLandings are critical for handling and storing woody material prior to hauling. Landings are located in and outside of the commercial treatment units. Existing landings, wide spots in the road or other already disturbed/impacted areas adjacent to roads will be used wherever possible. Some existing landings will be expanded, and some new short-term (temporary) landings may be needed, generally not exceeding 0.25 acre each. New landings will not be constructed within Riparian Reserves; however, landings that currently exist in Riparian Reserves may be reused where reuse constitutes less ground disturbance than new construction. Further design and specifications of these landings are addressed in the resource protection measures section in this chapter. The estimated number of new landings needed by alternative are as follows: Alternative 1 – 60 landings; Alternative 2 – 80 landings; Alternative 3 – 110 landings; Alternative 4 – 35 landings; Alternative 5 – 0 landings. Reforestation Release Reforestation treatments would be monitored for the need to control competing vegetation such as grasses, forbs, and shrubs that could inhibit the survival and growth of desirable seedlings. Hand grubbing of competing vegetation may be implemented within the first one to seven years following reforestation, depending on monitoring results. Prevention of Annosus SpreadIn areas where Annosus root disease (also known as Heterobasidion root disease) has been documented, all freshly cut living or recently killed conifer stumps greater than 14-inches (stump diameter) will be treated with an EPA-registered borate compound (e.g. Sporax® or Cellu-Treat®) within 4 hours after the tree is cut. Whenever possible, stumps will be treated immediately after cutting. Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study ______________________________ Federal agencies are required to rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives and to briefly discuss the reasons for eliminating any alternatives that were not developed in detail (40 CFR 1502.14). Public comments received in response to the Proposed Action provided suggestions for alternative methods for achieving the purpose and need. Some of these alternatives may have been outside the scope of the need for the proposal, duplicative of the alternatives considered in detail, or determined to contain components that would cause unnecessary environmental harm. Therefore, a number of alternatives were considered, but dismissed from detailed consideration for reasons summarized below: Alternative 7: Treat Along High Use Roads Only This proposal was suggested in scoping by EPIC and Wild Nature Institute (WNI), due to the potentially adverse effects of logging on sediment delivery and northern spotted owl habitat. High use roads are described in comments as busy, well-traveled roads (WNI), with the assumption that maintenance level 2 roads (often native surface roads, maintained for high clearance vehicles), receive less use than maintenance level 3 and 4 roads. Under this alternative, hazard trees and dead vegetation would be treated utilizing up to a 300-foot wide buffer on NFS lands along 80 miles (approximately 3,000 acres) of high-use roads open to the public (i.e. maintenance level 3 and 4 Forest Service system roads, county roads, and state highways) within the burn perimeter of the 2015 wildfires. Approximately 153 miles of open Forest Service system roads (maintenance level 2) would go untreated. Forest Plan direction instructs us to perform road maintenance activities to meet a variety of management objectives…[such as] (1) to provide for user safety… (page 4-16 and 4-17), and specifically addresses this need in Late Successional Reserve12, Administratively Withdrawn13 and Riparian Reserve14 management Standards and Guidelines. Trees impacted by the 2015 wildfires will continue to fall as trees deteriorate at increasing rates. This poses a direct hazard to vehicles and people with potential to be hit by a falling tree, but perhaps more likely it poses a hazard of becoming trapped by trees that fall across the road. Unless cutting firewood, most recreationists do not enter the forest with a chainsaw. This can lead to entrapment behind logs on remote roads. Maintenance Level 2 roads provide a recreational opportunity to the public, including OHV use, which is a popular pastime for Forest recreationists. Maintenance level 2 roads receive varying levels of use, with some being used daily and others being used less frequently; however, closing roads due to safety hazards restricts recreational opportunities, and leaving roads open where trees and snags pose falling and entrapment hazards would not be consistent with policy or the Forest’s responsibility to provide safe recreational opportunities to the public. This alternative was eliminated from detailed study because it does not meet the Purpose and Need to mitigate hazards on open roads in areas burned during the 2015 fires. This alternative would leave unsafe conditions on approximately 153 miles of open Forest Service system roads. Alternative 8: From Fire-kill to Fuelbreaks In September 2015, the Trinity County Collaborative (Collaborative) submitted a proposal to the Shasta-Trinity National Forest to respond to our post-fire landscape entitled “From Fire-kill to Fuelbreaks.” This proposal was crafted by a diverse group of local interested parties and largely supported by the Trinity County Collaborative membership. After working with the Trinity County Collaborative the Forest modified this proposal to develop the proposed action. While the main concepts of the proposal were incorporated into the proposed action, certain details were removed from the proposal and detailed as follows: 1. To improve drainage on slopes between 10-35 percent, dozers would rip soils 12 to 18inches deep with the contours, 20-feet between dozer passes, outside dripline of remaining green trees.15 The concept behind ripping soils 12-18 inches deep is to improve drainage within hydrophobic soils. Following fires, a thin layer of soil at or below the mineral soil surface can become hydrophobic after intense heating. The hydrophobic layer is the result of a waxy substance that is derived from plant material burned during a hot fire. This condition repels water, causing reduced water infiltration, which increases overland and stream flow (surface runoff) leading to erosion of fertile topsoil and sediment to streams. This condition can persist 12 Removal of snags and logs may be necessary to reduce hazards to humans along roads and trails, and in or adjacent to campgrounds. Where materials must be removed from the site, as in a campground or on a road, a salvage sale is appropriate (Forest Plan, p 4-38). 13 Through hazardous tree evaluation and control, provide an acceptable level of public safety with the least amount of damage and impact to the environment (Forest Plan, p 4-48). 14 Fell trees in Riparian Reserves when they pose a safety risk. Keep felled trees on-site when needed to meet coarse woody debris Objectives (Forest Plan, p 4-58). 15 Wording modified by the Collaborative from original scoping comments to “where appropriate”. for years. Plant roots and soil fauna eventually reduce hydrophobicity, but reduced infiltration does inhibit plant and root growth, which further slows down the process. Tilling and ripping are mechanical soil treatments aimed at improving infiltration rates in machine-compacted or water repellent soils. These treatments increase the amount of macropore space in soils by physical breakup of dense or water repellent soils, and thus increase the amount of rainfall that infiltrates into the soil. However, tilling and ripping are more effectively used with machine compacted soils (i.e. main skid trails and landings) to improve site-specific infiltration in compressed and nonproductive soils. Cross-country ripping can result in excessive reduction in soil productivity, as the subsoil gets mixed with topsoil. While hydrophobicity and erosion may be reduced in the short term, the soil disturbance reduces soil productivity in the long term. Due to the mechanical impact of incorporating dozers across the landscape where terrain allows, this proposal could create up to 3,650 acres of impact within these already distressed watersheds, and could result in about 730 equivalent roaded acres (ERA). This will take Hyampom (about 60 ERA) and Sulphur Glade-Waldorf Flat (about 8 ERA) watersheds further over the threshold of concern. Figure 2-1 Ripping and tilling of forested land following wildfire in the Sierra Nevadas. 2. To provide fire breaks and facilitate maintenance burning, a one-blade wide dozer trail would be constructed at outside edge of road buffer. The concept behind a bladed dozer trail is to take the opportunity (since equipment would already be on site) to blade a fireline in order to facilitate prescribed burning in the future. While the concept is logical, there are several challenges associated with this proposal: Within the Proposed Action, this could result in 466 miles of dozer line (about 600 additional ERAs), which would further adversely impact sensitive watersheds (see #1 above). The terrain is not consistent. There are many areas or patches where a dozer would not be able to parallel the road due to slope, thereby making disconnected segments of line. Since fire severity was variable, dozer line would be built through live and dead stands, thereby potentially resulting in the removal of viable green trees in an already stressed ecosystem. Since prescribed burning is controlled and monitored, a handline (which is much less impactive to resources) is appropriate for use. 3. To provide for future shaded cover, mixed conifer species would be planted at approximately a 30-foot spacing between planted trees (40-50 trees per acre). A shaded fuelbreak is generally comprised of enough mature trees to provide shade to inhibit growth of shrubs and other live surface fuels. Following fire, the landscape generally experiences variable effects ranging from little change in forest structure, to complete mortality, depending on fire severity and vegetation type. In areas experiencing full mortality, the seed sources (mature trees with cones) needed to naturally reforest are lacking or non-existent. Planting mixed conifer in these areas lacking seed sources would accelerate, by 50-100 years, the natural succession of a forested stand, providing a forested stand more quickly. A tree planting component is incorporated into the proposed action (and all alternatives) within the buffer widths. While the goal of a shaded fuelbreak is to have 40-50 mature trees per acre, planting at a 30-foot spacing (if all spots are plantable) would result in 48 seedlings being planted per acre. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that the 48 seedlings will ultimately be contributing to a future shaded fuelbreak due to seedling mortality. Planting to a denser spacing is preferred for a number of reasons including: Post-fire reforestation results in 30-80 percent survival within the first 5 years, depending on species and conditions. There are many reasons seedlings fail. For example, planting in drought years results in higher seedling mortality, as does planting without adequate site preparation, near high wildlife/grazing use areas, etc. Seedlings do not produce much shade. If there are not many conifers contributing to shade, it is more challenging for seedlings to out-compete the brush/understory species. Generally, after a few years, the conifers have overtopped the brush. In a denser stand, these saplings can start shading out the brush. However, even if all seedlings survived, 48 saplings/acre would not contribute enough shade to outcompete and start shading out the brush, potentially for decades. All seedlings are not equally healthy. Even with seedlings eventually taking hold (primarily from planted trees), seedlings, saplings, poles and eventually mature trees will continue to die. A denser spacing would allow natural selection to take place, retaining the strongest and healthiest into the future so that in a few decades, there are 40-50 mature trees to contribute to a shaded fuelbreak. Planting 48 seedlings to the acre in mixed conifer is inconsistent with the Forest Plan which (consistent with Regional guidelines) identifies a minimum of 150 trees/acre (recommended 200 trees/acre) 5 years after planting. As indicated above, planting to a 30-foot spacing does not provide the forest cover intended for the future desired condition, so this request was incorporated into the prescribed range of seedling spacing under the proposed action (18-30 foot spacing). An 18-foot spacing is wider than typically planted for a managed timber stand; however, the Forest agrees that areas along roads would better be managed for lower fuel loading levels to allow for safer ingress/egress rather than managed timber production. 4. Establish a South Fork Mountain Ridgetop Fuelbreak utilizing the ridgetop as the centerline for the 300-foot treatment width. South Fork Mountain Ridgetop was considered for a fuelbreak. It was removed from the proposed action for the following reasons: Ownership of sections along the ridgetop is mixed between private and National Forest System lands. Since public land within 150-feet of the ridgetop is substantially segmented, a continguous fuelbreak would not be implementable. This substantially reduces the value of a fuelbreak for controlling the spread of fire. The Route and Mad River Complexes did not connect, resulting in a substantial area of South Fork ridge that remains green with live vegetation. In addition, where these fires (Johnson and Pickett Fires) did burn across the ridgetop, the varied fire severity resulted in a mosaic of fire effects. In order for a fuelbreak to be effective on the ridgetop, both green and burned areas with live and dead fuels would require treatment; however, the Collaborative proposal only called for the treatment of dead fuels. This level of treatment does not support a classification of fuelbreak. Fuelbreak design incorporated into Alternative 2 includes treatment of live and dead fuels, and strategically located fuelbreaks. In addition, the 300-foot total width suggested in the Collaborative proposal is not a scientifically sound width for aridgetop fuelbreak inheavy timber16 (FOTG 1999). A fuelbreak width of 1200-foot total width was utilized in strategic areas in Alternative 2. These components were ultimately eliminated from detailed study because of the disproportionate impacts to watersheds or ineffectiveness in treatment as described above. The remaining concepts included in the “From Fire-kill to Fuelbreaks proposal have been incorporated into the Proposed Action for this project. Alternative 9: Landscape-Level Treatments and Reforestation The 2015 wildfires resulted in nearly 34,000 acres of forested lands burning at moderate to high fire severity, which resulted in substantial conifer mortality. As soon as these trees died, they began to deteriorate, losing both structural integrity and economic value. As these trees fall to the ground, they contribute to substantial fuel loading on the forest floor. Left unmanaged, these large areas with high levels of fuel loading could result in a greater vulnerability to future high severity wildfire as well as increasing the potential for type conversions from forest lands dominated by conifer trees to brush fields. In response to internal input as well as comments submitted by the American Forest Resource Council, the IDT considered landscape-level treatments that would address this condition. In addition to treatments proposed under the proposed action, this alternative incorporates landscape-level salvage (approximately 7,400 acres) and reforestation (approximately 14,000 acres) across the areas affected by the 2015 wildfires. All fire areas contained opportunities for larger landscape treatments; however, the South and River Complexes have the most areas of opportunity. Areas identified for salvage and fuels landscape treatments were between 5 and 40 acres in size, and consisted of stands of dead to mostly dead conifer trees of merchantable (greater than 12-inches for fire-killed conifers) size. Units identified incorporated all logging systems – tractor, cable and helicopter, and were prioritized based on high estimated residual fuel levels once snags fell to the ground. Following salvage/fuels reduction treatments, these stands would be planted to a mix of conifer species (i.e. Douglas-fir, ponderosa/Jeffery pine, sugar pine, incense cedar, white fir, red fir) historically appropriate for the site. Planting after treatment kick-starts the return of forest cover and sets the stand on a path to forested conditions faster than natural recovery. This is especially true for areas experiencing larger patches of high severity fire, effectively deforesting existing stands and removing sources of seed. In addition to areas identified for salvage, approximately 6,600 acres of conifer stands experiencing high to moderate severity fire were also identified for reforestation. These areas were identified based on fire severity, pre-fire species composition, proximity to roads and slope. This alternative was ultimately eliminated from detailed study because it is outside the Purpose and Need to provide for public safety along roads open to the public. Treatments away from the road buffer would not be consistent with the road safety-related Purpose and Need for this project. A 16 A minimum of 300 feet on either side is recommended through forested stands, more if area is sloped. separate project focusing on reforestation outside the proposed road buffer associated with this EIS, but within the post-fire landscape, may be analyzed. Alternative 10: WUI Fuels Treatments The 2015 wildfires resulted in nearly 12,200 acres of burned National Forest System lands in Wildland UrbanInterface (WUI) Zone 217 and Zone 318. As soon as the trees and brush died, they began to deteriorate. As the trees fall to the ground and combine with the dead brush, they contribute to substantial fuel loading on the forest floor. Left unmanaged, these areas with high levels of fuel loading would have high resistance to control concerns and could result in a greater vulnerability of future high severity wildfire, further threatening private inholdings. In addition, future wildfire in untreated post-fire landscapes increases the potential for type conversions from forest lands dominated by conifer trees to brush fields. In response to internal input, the IDT looked at the potential for treatments on NFS lands adjacent to (within 0.25 miles) private land boundaries or WUI areas, across all burn severities. In addition to treatments proposed under the proposed action, this alternative would incorporate fuels treatments including salvage within WUI zone 2 and 3 (approximately 12,187 acres). Fuels treatment goals within WUI Zone 2 are flame length less than 2 feet and no crown fire potential. Fuels treatment goals with WUI Zone 3 are flame length less than 4 feet and limited crown fire potential. Following fuels reduction treatments, moderate and high mortality stands would be planted to a spacing of 20 feet by 20 feet in WUI Zone 2 and 15 feet by 15 feet in WUI Zone 3 with a mix of conifer species (i.e. Douglas-fir, ponderosa/Jeffery pine, sugar pine, incense cedar, white fir, red fir) historically appropriate for the site. Planting after treatment kick-starts the return of forest cover and sets the stand on a path to forested conditions faster than natural recovery. Forested stands structured and maintained as a shaded fuel break have lower flame lengths, rates of spread, and resistance to control concerns compared to brush fields, allowing for more fire suppression options in the event of a wildfire. The wider tree spacing reduces crown fire initiation. Shaded fuelbreaks can be used for direct suppression actions with handtools. This alternative was ultimately eliminated from detailed study because it is outside the Purpose and Need to provide for public safety along roads open to the public. Treatments away from the road buffer would not be consistent with the road safety-related Purpose and Need for this project. A separate project focusing on fuels reduction in the WUI outside the proposed road buffer associated with this EIS, but within the post-fire landscape, may be analyzed. 17 WUI Zone 2 (Reduced Fuels Zone) extends from the private property boundary into the forest 100 feet. 18 WUI Zone 3 (Defense Zone) extends from the edge of Zone 2 to 0.25 mile from private property boundary. Resource Protection Measures Common to All Alternatives ________________________________ To minimize impacts to resources in the area from this project, the following resource protection measures are incorporated into all action alternatives, unless otherwise noted. Wildlife and Fish 1. Limited operating periods (LOPs)19 will be implemented to avoid potential impacts to northern spotted owls, fishers, bald eagles, northern goshawks, peregrine falcons, and anadromous fish: a. For northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina), limited operating periods (LOPs) are established in collaboration with the US Fish and Wildlife Service to limit potential disturbance or harm to this species while allowing project activities to proceed in areas where disturbance is much less likely to occur. In the majority of the project area, a February 1 through September 15 LOP will restrict activities directly manipulating suitable nesting/roosting or foraging (NRF) habitat, and a February 1 to July 10 LOP will restrict activities causing loud and continuous noise disturbance or smoke within 0.25 miles of suitable NRF habitat. i. In the road restoration treatments outside the hazard reduction and salvage treatment areas, a February 1 through July 31 LOP will restrict activities causing loud and continuous noise disturbance or smoke within 0.25 miles of suitable NRF habitat. ii. Findings from protocol surveys can be used to modify timing of operations. If subsequent protocol-compliant surveys show no nesting activity within 0.25miles of proposed activities at the time of implementation or by mutual agreement with the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), LOPs may be lifted. If surveys indicate that northern spotted owls are not resident in the area and LOPs are lifted, the FWS will be informed of the change. b. Treatment areas where less than 10% of the lands within 0.25 mi are preferable to NSO20 were reviewed with FWS to determine the relative benefits of LOP’s. LOP’s will not apply to the selected areas (see the wildlife section of Chapter 3 for a map of the areas where NSO LOPs will apply) because disturbance to NSO is much less likely to occur. Within these areas, pre-disturbance activity center searches will be conducted where treatments that may produce loud and continuous noise disturbance are proposed within high-value NSO cores (e.g., operations of heavy equipment and chain saws for a period of two hours or more). If nesting activity is observed, LOPs will be imposed as described in the preceding paragraphs. If activity center searches are not completed, LOP’s will apply. c. For bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), a limited operating period (LOP) will be imposed from January 1 to August 15 within 0.5 miles of all known bald eagle nest sites. This LOP will apply to all activities causing loud and continuous noise disturbance or smoke that will potentially disturb this species during its breeding season. If a bald eagle management plan has been written for a specific nesting site, 19 Limited operating periods refer to the period of time when restrictions on project implementation apply.

Surveys to protocol can be used to generate new breeding activity results. If subsequent protocol-compliant surveys show no nesting activity within 0.5 miles of proposed activities at the time of implementation, LOPs may be lifted. d. For peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), a limited operating period (LOP) will be imposed from February 1 to August 15 within 0.5 miles of all known falcon nest sites. This LOP will apply to all activities causing loud and continuous noise disturbance or smoke that will potentially disturb this species during its breeding season. If a peregrine falcon management plan has been written for a specific nesting site, the provisions of the plan will be incorporated into the project design. Surveys to protocol can be used to generate new breeding activity results. If subsequent protocol compliant surveys show no nesting activity within the nest site management zones at the time of implementation, LOPs may be lifted. e. For northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis), a limited operating period (LOP) will be imposed from February 1 to August 15 within 0.5 miles of all known goshawk nest sites. This LOP will apply to all activities causing loud and continuous noise disturbance or smoke that will potentially disturb this species during its breeding season. Surveys to protocol can be used to generate new breeding activity results. If subsequent protocol-compliant surveys show no nesting activity within 0.5 miles of proposed activities at the time of implementation, LOPs may be lifted. f. Field personnel and equipment will not enter waterways where anadromous fish are determined to be spawning or eggs would be incubating,21 as determined and indicated by a fish biologist. Restricted time periods are generally from October 15 through April 15. Additional restrictions may be appropriate for waterways containing spring Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and summer-run steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss), as determined by a qualified fish biologist (focus is protection of spawning and incubating eggs). Maps will be provided to those responsible for implementation. g. To avoid potential watershed-related impacts, including effects to anadromous fish, timber harvest activities will occur between April 15 and October 15 (Normal Operating Season). Timber harvest activities may occur outside of the Normal Operating Season if authorized by the appropriate Line Officer when: 1) weather conditions are favorable, 2) erosion control work is current, and 3) acceptance of recommendations from the district fisheries biologist and/or hydrologist. The dates of operations may also be constrained consistent with Wet Weather Operations Guidelines. The approximate percentage of the proposed treatment area that will be subject to wildlife LOP’s is as follows: January 1 – August 15: <1% February 1 – July 10: 38% February 1 – August 15: <1% February 1 -September 15: 24% No wildlife LOP: 38% 21 Appendix A in the Fish Specialist Report contains maps of anadromous fish streams within the project area that may be potentially affected. This report is on file in the project planning record at the Forest Headquarters and can be accessed on the Forest website at http://www.fs.fed.us/nepa/project_content.php?project=25380. h. If during project layout or implementation caves are found in units or within 250 feet of unit boundaries, an Earth Scientist would be consulted and a buffer flagged on the ground identifying an equipment exclusion zone, and/or modification of the prescription in the vicinity if needed. No project activities will take place within 250 feet from caves, mines and mine adits to protect known or potential sensitive bat species (Townsend’s big-eared bat, pallid bat, and fringed myotis) roost sites. Activities necessary to address safety threats (e.g. hazard trees to the road or operations) will prevail over this measure. 2. High-Value Wildlife Conservation Areas (HVWCAs) are defined as areas preferable22 to NSO and: 1. Within an NSO Critical Habitat Unit; or 2. Within a core area of an NSO territory that has a history of nesting or a resident pair, and preferable habitat conditions in at least 40% of the core area and 30% of the home range;23 or 3. Within an NSO core area that does not meet these criteria, but has been selected for additional protection in collaboration with the US Fish and Wildlife Service.24 HVWCAs are displayed on a map in the wildlife section of Chapter 3. a. Within HVWCAs the following measures will apply in all suitable NSO nesting/roosting, foraging, and post-fire foraging type 1 (PFF1) habitat areas:25 i. Tree removal (salvage) will be limited to trees posing a hazard to open roads and/or operations. Hazard is determined by factors including tree condition and height, and terrain (slope). (On flat ground in this area, a typical tree distance considered potentially hazardous to a road is 150 feet.) Beyond this distance, trees posing a hazard to operations or haul routes will be cut to abate the safety hazard, and will be subject to removal only where their retention would pose a safety hazard if left on-site as logs. ii. In NSO nesting/roosting habitat within HVWCAs, no mechanical or tractor based operations, including salvage treatments, will occur. iii. Except where it poses a hazard to operations or haul routes, all CWD in advanced states of decay (snag and log decay classes 3-5) will be retained. Where it is available, at least 15 tons of coarse woody debris (CWD) per acre will be retained for wildlife benefit (CWD = snags 15 inches or greater in diameter and logs greater than 20 inches diameter and 10 feet long). In the areas where there is a need to retain fire-killed CWD in addition to decayed snags and logs to meet this standard, snags and logs in the size classes listed above that have deformities such as cat faces, broken or forked tops, hollows or cavities will be prioritized for retention. 22 Preferable habitat is defined as “Highly selected for” or “selected for” based on the US Fish and Wildlife Service Relative Habitat Suitability (RHS) modeling. RHS incorporates NSO survey results and abiotic factors such as slope aspect and elevation to predict areas most likely to be used by NSO. Databases such as E-veg and field verification efforts identify NSO habitat suitability at specific sites (nesting/roosting and foraging habitats, as well as dispersal and post-fire foraging areas). These identify vegetative conditions at specific sites rather than the likelihood of NSO use of any specific site. 23 An NSO core area is all land within 0.5 mi. of an NSO activity center. An NSO home range (territory) is all land within 1.3 mi. of an activity center. 24 These areas have been mapped and are identified in the project wildlife biological assessment. 25 This categorization is based on data collected during field visits, aerial photo interpretation, and the E-veg owl habitat suitability database. Post-fire foraging type 1 areas are NSO nesting/roosting or foraging (NRF) habitats that were affected by moderate-or high-severity fire and within 500 feet of currently suitable (surviving) NRF habitats. b. Outside of HVWCAs, the following measures will apply in all suitable NSO nesting/roosting, foraging, and post-fire foraging type 1 (PFF1) habitat areas:26 i.  Tree removal (i.e. salvage) will occur where there is a hazard to open roads and/or operations, and may also occur beyond that, up to the maximum buffer distance from the road in each alternative.  ii.  Where it is available, an average of at least 10 tons of CWD per acre will be retained for wildlife benefit. (CWD = snags 15 inches or greater in diameter and logs greater than 20 inches diameter and 10 feet long). Snags with deformities such as cat faces, broken or forked tops, hollows or cavities will be prioritized for retention.  Botany3. All plant populations requiring protection from proposed treatments will be flagged on the ground and some or all treatments may be excluded within those populations. These sites will be shown on project implementation maps as control areas. 4. If individuals of protected species (see the botany section of chapter 3 for a full list of sensitive species and other protected species that occur within the project area) are discovered after project implementation begins, all off-road ground-disturbing operations will be stopped temporarily in the area of discovery until a Forest Service Botanist or representative recommends appropriate protection measures. This measure will be incorporated into the project design through a sale contract provision or similar language in any service contracts. Western Waterfan Lichen 5. Stream crossings, rocked or otherwise, will not be constructed on Collins Creek or any of its tributaries known to be occupied by Goward’s waterfan lichen to avoid potential damage. Niles’ and Stebbins’ Harmonia 6. Ditch cleaning and brushing associated with project related road maintenance and using heavy equipment with a blade will be restricted to no higher than 24 inches above the ground to reduce potential impacts to Niles’ and Stebbins harmonia plants that can occupy cut and fill slopes. Ditches may be cleaned without restriction up to a height of 24 inches above the bottom of slopes. Vegetation above 24 inches that obstructs vehicle line of sight will be manually cut and removed without disturbing the roadside. Pacific Fuzzwort 7. Standard provisions for protection of residual trees will be included in all implementation contracts or agreements to avoid accidental scraping of potential Pacific fuzzwort mats at the base of host trees. Operations shall not unnecessarily damage young growth or other trees to be reserved. Umpqua Green Gentian 8. Handline construction will not occur within known populations of Umpqua green gentian near Pickett Peak. 9. Heavy equipment use will be excluded from naturally occurring grassy or gravelly openings within late-seral conifer forest. 26 This categorization is based on data collected during field visits, aerial photo interpretation, and the E-veg owl habitat suitability database. Post-fire foraging type 1 areas are NSO nesting/roosting or foraging (NRF) habitats that were affected by moderate-or high-severity fire and are within 500 feet of currently suitable (surviving) NRF habitats. Canyon Creek Stonecrop 10. Trees will be directionally felled away from rock outcrops or exposed bedrock greater than 10 feet in diameter. Heavy Equipment Use 11. Machine piling, skid trails, new landing construction, and pile burning treatments will be excluded from within known Sensitive botanical populations. Locations will be flagged on the ground and marked as control areas on operational maps. 12. Machine piling will be restricted to landings and areas of pre-fire heavy soil disturbance, except where field surveys are conducted and absence of Sensitive botanical species is verified. 13. When using tractors to remove felled trees, material will be skidded with one end suspended wherever possible to minimize soil gouging and potential damage to potential unidentified Sensitive botanical species. Burning14. Burning prescriptions will be developed to result in mortality of no more than 10% of residual live trees 20 inches dbh or greater in late-seral habitats. Serpentine Habitats and Species15. Hazard trees will be felled where found in all Type 1 and Type 2 serpentine habitats (see below) serpentine habitats. Different types and mixes of serpentine habitats warrant different management requirements based on the quality and/or sensitivity of each site. In general, management and protection measures correspond to three broad serpentine habitat descriptions; only Types 1 and 2 require special protection measures. Serpentine habitats requiring additional protections will be identified on project implementation maps as control areas. 16. Serpentine Habitat Type #1. Open areas with a high content of serpentinite and peridotite minerology, sparsely vegetated with occasional shrubs and few or no conifers: a. Exclude heavy equipment from these sites. No machinery off of well-established tracks, routes, or roads; No vehicle or equipment staging, log decking, skid trail, landing, or road construction through these sites. Previously constructed landing sites that are heavily disturbed may be used after botanist approval. b. No pile burning. c. Hazard trees will be left in place after falling. d. No landing construction or use, unless approved by a botanist. 17. Serpentine Habitat Type #2. Forest or shrubland habitats with widely spaced trees (30 trees per acre or less). There may be scattered large conifers, as well as distinct clumps of small to large shrubs; all of which may have burned in concentrations producing hazard trees. Forest or shrubland habitats with a moderate or high number of openings between trees. There may be scattered clumps of large mature trees [Jeffrey pine, incense cedar, hardwoods], as well as distinct clumps of small to large shrubs; all of which may have burned in concentrations producing hazard trees. a. Exclude heavy equipment from these sites. No machinery off of well-established tracks, routes or roads; No vehicle or equipment staging, log decking, skid trail, landing or road construction through these sites. Previously constructed sites that are heavily disturbed may be used after botanist approval. b. No pile burning. c. Felled hazard trees will be left in place unless they can be removed from the site by full suspension or endlined by equipment that remains on well-established existing roads. d. No landing construction or use, unless approved by a botanist 18. Serpentine Habitat Type #3. Soils contain serpentine fragments, but a full diversity of trees, shrubs, and forbs is present. No restrictions on any operations unless other protection measures apply. Noxious Weeds/Non-native Invasive Species 19. All heavy equipment operating off roads will be cleaned and inspected before entering the treatment area to be sure they are free of debris that could contain weed propagules. 20. Prior to implementation of mechanical operations each season, some sites containing high priority invasive weeds may be managed to reduce the potential for weed spread. High priority weed sites are those that contain invasive species that are known to be very invasive, limited in geographic extent within the project area, and/or are within close proximity to high value natural resources such as Sensitive plant populations. Management options include but are not limited to scheduling treatments before seed has set, avoiding infested sites with designated control areas, hand pulling weed sites before operations begin, and covering infested sites. Strategic scheduling of operations will occur between infested and non-infested areas. Managed sites will be identified on a map. 21. No herbicides will be used to treat or manage any invasive plant species. 22. Invasive species in high priority weed sites within treatment areas that respond positively to removal will be physically removed and disposed of off-site (if necessary to avoid leaving plant parts that can regrow); removed plants with no propagative parts will be left on site. High priority invasive species sites that cannot be treated effectively with manual removal treatments (i.e. handpulling stimulates resprouting) will be flagged and vehicles and equipment will be excluded from those sites to reduce chance of weed spread. Weed removal in high priority weed sites will occur no more than 30 days before timber operations begin. 23. To discourage establishment of invasive weeds in selected disturbed areas within the project area, native grass and forb seed and/or non-persistent cereal grains may be spread where there is heavy soil disturbance. These areas include but are not limited to temporary roads, landings, and main skid trails. Cereal grains will be restricted to annual “recleaned” varieties (have been processed to reduce weed seeds and other debris) that are expected to disappear from sites within 3-5 years. 24. Grass and forb seed will be species that are known from the Klamath Ranges, preferably species found on similar habitats on the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Only seed that has been tested and meets California State standards for noxious weed content and seed quality will be used. Species selection will ultimately depend on seed availability, but under no circumstances will non-native perennial species be used. All seeded areas will be mulched with weed-free straw or on-site organic materials. Riparian Reserve Areas25. Table 2-1 below provides the minimum Riparian Reserve boundary widths by category of stream and/or waterbody (Forest Plan 4-53, 4-54). When calculating Riparian Reserve buffer size In some cases, field evaluation may reveal that the Riparian Reserve is actually wider than indicated by the GIS layer. Table 2-1 Minimum Riparian Reserve Boundary Widths, by Stream or Waterbody Category. Stream and/or  Seasonally flowing or  Fish-bearing perennial streams  Perennial non-fish-bearing  Waterbody  intermittent streams or  and lakes or natural ponds  streams and wetlands > 1  Category  wetlands < 1 acre or unstable or potentially unstable areas  acre  Extent of Riparian  A distance equal to the  A distance equal to the height  A distance equal to the  Reserve Width  height of 1 site potential tree on each side of the channel, or 100 feet on each side of the channel, wetland or unstable area (200 feet total), whichever is greatest.  of 2 site potential trees on each side of the channel or edge of the lake or pond, or 300 feet on each side of the channel or edge of the lake or pond (600 feet total), whichever is greatest.  height of 1 site potential tree on each side of the channel or edge of the wetland, or 150 feet on either side of the channel or edge of the wetland (300 feet total), whichever is greatest.  26. Because no Watershed Analyses are completed in the Eltapom and Corral planning watersheds, imminent hazard trees/snags would be felled along roads, but no logs would be removed from Riparian Reserves unless the log falls within 200 feet upstream of a culvert and threatens stability of road infrastructure. No treatments beyond mitigating hazard trees (felling and leaving onsite) along any road segment would occur in the East Fork New River planning watershed. 27. Riparian Reserves along perennial flowing streams will be Equipment Exclusion Zones. Trees within 150 feet of the stream will be felled towards the stream and left onsite. Trees within the outer 150 feet of fish-bearing stream Riparian Reserves may be removed by endlining to the road if more than 20 tons/acre of CWD occurs. In the outer 150 feet, 20 tons/acre of the largest CWD will be left. In Riparian Reserves where a road runs parallel to a perennial stream and/or bisects the Riparian Reserve by winding in and out, trees uphill of the road may be removed until 20 tons/acre of the largest CWD is left, even if the area uphill of the road is closer to the stream than 150’. Equipment used to remove trees from the uphill of the road will remain on the existing roadbed. 28. Riparian Reserves along intermittently flowing streams will be comprised of two zones: the inner Equipment Exclusion Zone (EEZ) and the outer Riparian Reserve treatment zone. When water is flowing within intermittent streams, the EEZ will be 100 feet on each side of the channel. When the stream is not flowing, the EEZ will be 50 feet on each side of the channel. All heavy equipment is excluded from EEZs, except at designated crossings. 29. All EEZs will be identified as "streamside buffer" on project maps. 30. Wetlands (including wet meadows, seeps, fens, and springs), stream inner gorges and unstable and potentially unstable land features are also EEZs. Where stream inner gorges are wider than the EEZ, the EEZ is extended to include the entire inner gorge plus the addition of a 50-foot buffer beyond the inner gorge feature. Unstable and potentially unstable land features (active landslides) are also protected by a 50’ EEZ buffer. 31. Hand treatments are permissible in EEZs up to the high water mark; no green vegetation would be treated. Hand treatments will have limited ground disturbance in the EEZ and will not disturb riparian plant species such as big leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), willow (Salix spp.) and alder (Alnus spp.) except for hazard tree abatement. 32. When snags are felled within the intermittent stream EEZ, they will be left unless there is a site specific reason for removing them, such as desired coarse woody debris levels are met and heavy fuel loading occurs (greater than 20 tons/acre), or the tree is within 200 feet upstream of a culvert and threatens stability of road infrastructure. If heavy fuel loading occurs, 20 tons/acre of the largest CWD will be left. In the stream channel, the small material that can clog a culvert resulting from fallen trees within 200 feet upstream will be removed. 33. Riparian Reserves that are unmapped will be identified and protected, prior to and/or during implementation, in accordance with appropriate protection measures (see Table 2-1). Upon field review, if ephemeral streams show no sign of annual scour or deposition (i.e., upland swales) they do not meet the Forest Plan definition of a seasonal or intermittent channel (they are not Riparian Reserves). 34. Hand piling and pile burning will not occur within the EEZs.27 However fire may be allowed to back into these areas, providing the fire spread will be controllable. Landings, skid trails and crossings within Riparian Reserve 35. Existing landings within the Riparian Reserve can be reused; however, the area of disturbance will not be increased and these features will be tilled28 and seeded29 following use where they do not need to be retained as part of the road system.30 No new landings will be constructed within the Riparian Reserve. No existing landings within EEZs will be used unless they are connected to a system road.31 36. No full bench skid trails will be constructed within the Riparian Reserve. 37. Any designated intermittent and perennial stream equipment crossings (except Forest Service system roads) will be field reviewed and approved by an earth scientist, fish biologist, botanist, or designee prior to use, and will avoid unstable areas. These features will be rocked crossings designed to maintain fish passage on existing and potential fish-bearing streams.32 They will be reshaped and stabilized following use. If intermittent stream crossings are left in place for wet weather operations, they will be removed during the following dry season. 38. During construction of temporary stream crossings disturbance to existing live vegetation will be minimized to the maximum extent possible. When the crossing is rehabilitated, fill will be pulled back from the crossing so that the original stream level is re-established when the culvert is removed. Water drafting 40. Water drafting will: a. occur at existing sites with existing access; b. minimize adverse effects on stream channel stability and instream flows needed to maintain riparian resources; c. minimize sedimentation; d. minimize impacts tofish habitat;33and e. utilize a fish screen to prevent fish entrapment. 41. Water drafting sites that are not within habitat that is accessible to anadromous salmonids will be identified first and will be given priority for use. When needed, water drafting may occur 27 These treatments will occur as secondary fuels treatments and will not be implemented as part of the timber sale. 28 Tilling refers to the use of machinery to break the soil surface to loosen compacted soil and increase permeability. 29 See specifications on tilling in the Soils/Hydrology Resource Protection Measure section below and specifications on seeding in the Noxious Weed Resource Protection Measure section above. 30 Wide areas along roads used as landings are often also used as turn outs for vehicle traffic and are considered part of the road system. Where these occur within Riparian Reserves, they will be retained. 31 Road pullouts are sometimes used as landings. 32 Forest Plan Standard and Guideline, page 4-55 in the Forest Plan. 33 Forest Plan Standard and Guideline, page 4-58 in the Forest Plan. in habitat accessible by anadromous salmonids. In all cases where water drafting occurs within anadromous salmonid habitat,34 2001 National Marine Fisheries Service’s (NMFS) Water Drafting Specifications35 will be adhered to. Any new drafting sites will be approved by a Forest Service Fish Biologist and/or hydrologist prior to use. In addition, when drafting water the following rules apply.36 a. Allow drafting from fish bearing streams only where immediate downstream discharge is maintained at 1.5 cubic feet per second (CFS) or greater. b. Allow drafting from ephemeral streams, intermittent streams, wetlands or constructed ponds provided that sufficient water quantity and quality remains to support associated wildlife species and riparian values. c. Never allow drafting to remove more than 75 percent of constructed pond water. Soils and Hydrology41. Relevant BMPs have been identified for this project and are listed in Appendix C. 42. Retain downed logs in decay classes 3 and 437 (Maser and Trappe 1984) for soil fertility purposes whenever possible. Landings and skid trails 43. Mechanical skidding equipment is generally restricted to slopes less than 40 percent. On short steep pitches (less than 45% slope, and less than 100 ft in length), mechanical skidding equipment is restricted to slash covered primary skid trails using flexible track skidders with low ground pressure equipment. 44. Wet weather logging is permitted on soils with compaction hazard rating of moderate or less with restrictions (see Field Guide to Soil Moisture Conditions for Operability of Logging Equipment (Rust 2015) and Shasta-Trinity Wet Weather Soil Compaction Hazard Rating (Rust 2008)). 45. Ground-based mechanical equipment will only operate on fine-textured soils (identified as medium and heavy soils in the Field Guide to Soil Moisture Conditions for Operability of Logging Equipment (Rust 2015)) when the top 8 inches of soil are dry (identified as slightly moist soils in the Field Guide), as evaluated by Forest soil scientist or designee. Areas along roads proposed for treatments that have this soil type will be identified on a map for use by the Timber Sale Administrator. 46. Post-treatment total soil cover should be between 50 and 70 percent averaged across the treatment area on metamorphics with at least 50 percent cover as fine organic matter (duff, litter, plant leaves/needles, fine slash (<3 inch material), etc.). On granitics, soil cover should be greater than 90 percent with at least 50 percent cover as fine organic matter. In some cases in this project area, soil cover has been removed by high intensity fire conditions; in these 34 Refer to Figure 4 in the Fish Biological Assessment which illustrates the river or tributary reaches that are accessible to anadromous fish and are therefore coho salmon Critical Habitat. They include the entire South Fork Trinity River, Hayfork Creek and its tributaries, and approximately the lower mile of Butter Creek, lower 1.5 miles of Plummer Creek, and lower 2 miles of Rattlesnake Creek. 35 The 2001 National Marine Fisheries Service’s (NMFS) Water Drafting Specification document is located at http://www.westcoast.fisheries.noaa.gov/publications/hydropower/water_drafting_specification_guidelines.pdf. 36 Forest Plan Standard and Guideline, page 4-25 in the Forest Plan. 37 Class 3: Intact, soft logs in full contact with the soil; no branches or bark; high moisture content; very high biological activity in fully penetrated sapwood; some biological activity in heartwood. Class 4: Intact to fractured cubical heartwood and bark; log mostly buried in the soil; very high moisture content; extremely high biological activity, mostly microorganisms and sub-microscopic invertebrates; fully penetrated by mychorrizal fungi and roots. areas, soil cover will be retained to the extent practicable during implementation and in some cases will be increased by treatments. Areas along roads proposed for treatments that have this soil type will be identified on a map for use by the Timber Sale Administrator. 47. In treatment areas susceptible to logging-based soil displacement38 (shallow granitic soils) keep skidders (rubber tired or fixed track) on slopes less than 35%. Avoid displacing topsoil (typically 2 to 4 inches) and exposing erosive subsoils on areas greater than 15 by 15 feet outside of skid trails, unless mulched. Only operate on these soils when soil is no wetter than the moist category identified in the Field Guide to Soil Moisture Conditions for Operability of Logging Equipment (Rust, 2015) down to 8 inches. Areas along roads proposed for treatments that have this soil type will be identified on a map for use by the Timber Sale Administrator. 48. All material will be skidded with one end suspended, where possible. 49. No skid trails will be built on active landslides or inner gorges, and no existing skid trails on active landslides or inner gorges will be used. 50. Reuse existing primary skid trails and landings where available and practical to minimize soil displacement and concentrated surface flow. 51. Skid trails will not run along the axis of intermittent channels or swales. 52. Till (subsoil to 18 inches) all landings identified for rehabilitation, temporary roads, and main skid trails (up to 200 feet entering landings) that have fine textured soils with a winged-subsoiler following completion of all management activities. Tilling will be completed outside of the tree drip-line so as not to impact root systems. For rocky soil, scarification39 will be used to restore sites. These areas should be mulched (weed free straw, wood chips or on-site organic material) at a rate of 1.5 to 2 tons per acre (approximately 4 to 6 inches in depth) over a minimum of 75 percent of the exposed soils, where necessary to prevent erosion. 53. Minimize soil erosion by water-barring skid trails. Install waterbars on contour at major breaks in slope along the skid trails. 54. New landings will be located on gentle slopes (<20%) to minimize earthwork, and will avoid unstable areas, steep slopes below landslide benches, and slope positions where they could deliver sediment to streams. Cuts and fills would not exceed 5 feet in height, unless field reviewed and approved by an earth scientist beforehand. 55. Pull organic materials out of fill slope of landings to prevent collapse. 56. Landings will have natural, non-constructed designs. If non-constructed design is not feasible, landings will be constructed to adequately drain through crowned surface and directed drainage with catchment structures (rock armoring and/or silt fences with straw bales may be used as necessary). All new landing fill slopes and access road fill slopes (>100 sq. ft.) would be mulched initially, and then the mulch would be maintained throughout the life of the project; mulch may be weed-free straw, or landing slash. Areas with new road and landing fill will be rehabilitated after treatments are complete. 57. New landings will occur in areas that are generally open or fire deforested, whenever possible. 38 Detrimental soil displacement is excessive topsoil moved laterally from its usual place by blading or pushed aside by machines or logs, most likely to occur on steep shallow soils. 39 Scarification involves light disturbance of the soil surface, as opposed to deep tilling to 18 inches. General road measures 58. Roads rutted by operations shall be spot rocked or otherwise suitably repaired. Drainage structures shall be protected or repaired as necessary. Road surfaces expected to be used during wet weather, in areas crossing serpentine soils, should be rocked to prevent roadbed deformation (rutting) during wet conditions. 59. Dispose of unsuitable slide and excess fill in stable, non-floodplain sites. Fill material will be inspected by a botanist, weed specialist, or designee prior to moving for presence of noxious weeds. If noxious weeds are present, they will be treated prior to moving the fill, and the disposal site will be monitored in the future and treated as necessary. Fuel Treatment Operations 60. Fuel reduction activities (machine piling using brush rakes or grapple heads) should retain >50 percent of the existing surface duff (Forest Plan Soil Quality Standards), where it currently exists. 61. For machine piling on fine textured soils, weight restrictions should be set 6.0 PSI ground pressure or less and operate on dry40 soils less than 40 percent slope. 62. Excess activity-created slash and existing surface fuels (where they exceed 16 inches in depth and are greater than 10 tons per acre) may be machine or hand piled or masticated on slopes less than 40 percent and hand piled on slopes greater than 40 percent. 63. Ground-based mastication operations on fine-textured soils (clay loams, clays, silty clay loams) should comply with the following restrictions: a. Operate with low ground pressure equipment (less than 6 PSI) on slopes less than 40% when soil moisture is no wetter than the moist category on medium soils and slightly moist category on heavy soils to 8 inches in depth as identified in the Field Guide to Soil Moisture Conditions for Operability of Logging Equipment (Rust, 2015; evaluated by Forest soil scientist or designee). b. Drive over masticated material to form a cushion to reduce displacement and compaction. c. For equipment with ground pressure over 6 PSI, operations on slopes less than 40% will be conducted when the soils are no wetter than the slightly moist category for medium and the dry category for heavy soils down to 8 inches as identified in the Field Guide to Soil Moisture Conditions for Operability of Logging Equipment (Rust, 2015). 64. All machine piles shall be reasonably compact (averaging 10 feet high by 10 feet wide in size) and free of soil to facilitate burning and shall be constructed of such size and at such distance from green trees so that burning shall not result in unnecessary damage to residual timber. 65. Outside of landings or roads, machine piling will not be utilized to reduce fuel within the Hyampom and Sulphur Glade sixth-field (HUC6) subwatersheds. 66. Within the Hyampom and Sulphur Glade sixth-field (HUC 6) subwatersheds, salvage removal will not be prescribed in areas that burned at very low to low severity. 67. Hand piles will be placed in a dispersed pattern (i.e., not stacked above one another), averaging 6 foot high by 6 foot wide in size. 68. Fuel loading will be reduced to an average of 20 tons/acre in the Limited Roaded Recreation prescription, consistent with the Forest Plan (page 4-47). 40 Dry is defined as less than 18% moisture by weight. Naturally Occurring Asbestos 67. Mechanical operations in ultramafic soils should operate on slightly moist or moist soils to reduce dust levels that could contain naturally occurring asbestos (NOA). 68. All field personnel who will be working near earth-moving, or other dust-producing activities in areas underlain by ultramafic rock will be informed that NOA commonly occurs in that rock, and they will be provided with a map showing such areas. 69. Dust production will be prevented/minimized by applying effective dust abatement measures, such as applying water or other dust inhibitors to materials being worked; operating when soil conditions are moist enough to limit dust, but not be so wet as to result in rutting or sedimentation into streams; reducing vehicle speed; and avoiding dust-producing activities on excessively windy days. Ensure road surfaces are wet. Where needed, wet road surfaces with water trucks using sprinklers to reduce dust. 70. Where dust prevention in ultramafic areas is not possible, appropriate protection and mitigation measures will be applied so that Forest Service and contractor field personnel will not inhale such dust. These include closing windows on vehicles and turning on positive ventilation systems, or use of appropriate air filtration masks if other measures are not adequate. 71. If rock/soil waste is generated from ultramafic areas, such waste will be disposed of only where the underlying rock is also ultramafic, and it will not be mixed with other waste from non-ultramafic areas. When transporting NOA-containing material, avoid overloading trucks and cover with tarps to reduce dust. Ensure that piles of excavated material are wet and cover with tarps to reduce dust. Air Quality72. Prescribed burning will be implemented in accordance with California Code of Regulations, Title 17, Smoke Management Guidelines for Agricultural and Prescribed Burning. A Smoke Management Plan will be completed and submitted to the appropriate Air Quality Management District for approval prior to implementing any prescribed fire. 73. Use of prescribed fire will comply with Forest Service, California Air Resources Board and North Coast Unified Air Quality Management District guidelines. 74. To mitigate the potential for significant impacts and nonconformity, the Forest will coordinate prescribed fire in the airsheds to distribute the burn days appropriately throughout the year. Activity fuel handpiles will be constructed on average 6 feet high by 6 feet wide. Activity fuel machine piles will be constructed on average 10 feet high by 10 feet wide. The coordination will include communication with the North Coast Unified Air Quality Management District (AQMD), personnel for adequate burn days, based on current air quality within the basin and weather conditions. The South Fork and Trinity River Management Units will develop a plan that meets the objectives of the management unit and maintain conformity with the State Implementation Plans (SIP) and Clean Air Act (CAA). 75. Monitor smoke transport and dispersion during prescribed fire. Cultural Resources 76. All archeological sites shall be clearly delineated prior to implementing any associated activities that have the potential to affect historic properties. Historic property boundaries shall be delineated with coded flagging and/or other effective marking. 77. If mechanical equipment is used in treatment buffers, all recorded cultural and archaeological resources will be flagged and avoided following the site protective guidelines in the Region 5 Section 106 Programmatic Agreement. However, vegetation within these sites can be removed using tools such as hand tools, a grapple, or a rubber tired skidder so long as ground disturbance is minimized and features avoided. Treatments within individual cultural and archeological sites must be approved and monitored by a Forest Service archeologist. 78. Woody material may be chipped within the boundaries of historic properties so long as the staging of chipping equipment on-site does not affect historic properties and staging areas are specifically approved by the Heritage Program Manager (HPM) or qualified Heritage Program staff. 79. Monitoring by heritage program specialists may be used to enhance the effectiveness of protection measures. 80. The recorded historic properties will be noted in the contract as controlled areas to be avoided. Contract administrators will insure these protective measures are followed. 81. If new cultural resources are discovered, all work in the vicinity will cease until qualified Heritage Program staff examines and assesses the resource. Appropriate measures will be undertaken to protect the new resource as activities resume. Pathology82. To prevent the spread of Annosus root disease (also known as Heterobasidion root disease) in areas where the disease has been documented, all freshly cut living or recently killed conifer stumps greater than 14-inches (stump diameter) will be treated with an EPA-registered borate compound (e.g. Sporax® or Cellu-Treat®) within 24 hours after the tree is cut. Whenever possible, stumps will be treated immediately after cutting. 83. Do not apply borate directly to water, or to areas where surface water is present. Do not contaminate water when disposing of equipment washwaters or rinsate. General Protection Measures 84. Forest Earth Scientists, contract administrators, and Engineers would maintain contact after the contract is finalized so that final locations of landings and temporary roads could be evaluated in the field if necessary. Coordination would also be established between the earth science and the fuels program concerning burning activities. The project geologist would be available for consultation during implementation. 85. Implementation shall not unnecessarily damage young growth or other residual live trees. 86. Felling and bucking shall be done to minimize breakage of logs removed during the commercial operations. Comparison of Alternatives ___________________ Table 2-2 provides a brief summary of the alternatives and their environmental impacts in comparative format. Table 2-2.

Handline should hold the fire. 5 Years: Fires are too intense for direct attack on the head by persons using hand tools. Hand line cannot be relied on to hold the fire. Equipment such as dozers, pumpers, and retardant aircraft can be effective. 10 Years: Fires may present serious control problems torching, crowning, and spotting.

Also described are the environmental effects (direct, indirect, and cumulative) that would result from undertaking the proposed action or alternative. Together, these descriptions form the scientific and analytical basis for the comparison of effects in Chapter 2. Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Future Actions ____________________________________ According the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA regulations, “cumulative impact” is the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such actions (40 CFR 1508.7). In determining cumulative effects, the effects of the past, present and future actions (see tables below) were added to the direct and indirect effects of the proposed action and alternatives. Due to the nature of variability between resource types, analysis areas may differ between resources. Analysis areas are described in each resource section to describe the area analyzed for that resource. As such, the following lists of projects considered for cumulative effects are comprehensive for each fire area, but not all of these projects may be included in the cumulative effects analysis for each resource The acres listed in the tables below are acres affected by the fire for each project listed. Table 1-1 shows a list of the fires and Figure 1-1 shows a map of the fires (both can be found in Chapter 1). Table 3-1.

Increased flame lengths reduces fire suppression strategies and effectiveness and increases the likelihood of torching events and crown fires. • Fireline Intensity: The rate of energy or heat release per unit length of fire front (British Thermal Units (BTU) per foot per second). Increased fireline intensity reduces fire suppression strategies and effectiveness. • Suppression Action: The type of suppression resource needed to contain the fire and its effectiveness. These are appropriate indicators for this analysis because they give information about potential fire behavior. Risks to firefighters, workers, and the public can be assessed from potential fire behavior. Increased flame lengths can increase the likelihood of torching events and crown fires. Flame length is influenced in part by fuel type, fuel arrangement, fuel moisture, and weather conditions. Flame length and fireline intensity influence production rates, or how fast firelines can be constructed by different suppression resources, including hand crews and mechanical equipment. Flame lengths over 4 feet, or fireline intensities over 100 BTU per foot per second, may present control problems. These conditions are too dangerous to be directly contained by hand crews (Schlobohm and Brain 2002; Andrews and Rothermel 1982). Flame lengths over 8 feet or fireline intensities over 500 BTU per foot per second are generally not controllable by ground-based equipment or aerial retardant, and present control problems including torching, crowning, and spotting. Flame length and fireline intensity directly affect suppression tactics. Table 3-7 outlines how flame lengths and fireline intensities influence fire suppression actions (Andrews et al. 2011). Table 3-7. Predicted Average Surface Fire Flame Length, Fireline Intensity, and Suppression Actions. Flame length  Fireline intensity  Suppression Actions  Feet  Meters  Btu/ft/s  kJ/m/s  < 4  < 1.2  < 100  <350  Fires can generally be attacked at the head or flanks by persons using hand tools.

Control efforts at the fire head will probably be ineffective  > 11  > 3.4  > 1000  > 3500  Crowning, spotting, and major fire runs are probable. Control efforts at head of fire are ineffective.  Analysis AreasThe geographic project area is the Fork Complex, South Complex, Mad River Complex, Route Complex, River Complex, and Saddle Fire burn boundaries. The cumulative effects boundary for this analysis is the project boundary. Treated areas in this project along with past, present and reasonably foreseeable future projects within the cumulative effects area will be analyzed for cumulative effects. For the purpose of the vegetation, fire, and fuels analysis, the temporal bounds include a 20-year horizon for future direct, indirect, and cumulative effects because modeling indicates that within 20 years, fuels profiles change dramatically after fire. Also, any predictions past 20 years will be greater than the fire return intervals for much of the project area. Fire Behavior Analysis MethodologyFuels profiles (i.e. the vertical cross section of a fuel bed down to mineral earth showing fuel types, size and amount) were gathered and analyzed using 43 representative 1/50th acre random plots throughout the project area. The data was used to compare current fuel loading to projected future conditions. Fuels data plots are in the project record. The amount of dead and down woody debris accumulating on the surface of a given area and what is created by hazard tree abatement is quantified as tons per acre and diameter size class to determine values for resource needs and fire behavior. Analysis for fire behavior was calculated using the 90th percentile fire weather factors from Mt. Elizabeth Weather Station during 1978-2009 (4933’ elevation; May 1-Oct 31). Future predicted fuel models will also be utilized. Fire effects analysis used flame length and fireline intensity. Flame lengths and fireline intensities were based on fuel models under the 90th percentile weather conditions. Dead and live fuels, used in fuel models, are described by size. For example 1-hour fuels are fine, flashy fuels smaller than 0.25 inches in diameter, 10-hour fuels are 0.25 to 1 inch in diameter, 100-hour fuels are 1 to 3 inches in diameter, and 1000-hour fuels are often termed coarse woody debris and are greater than 3 inches in diameter42. Fuel models are described by the volume of 1-hour, 10-hour, 100-hour, and 1000-hour dead fuels; herbaceous and woody live fuels; fuel bed depth; and moisture of extinction43. Coarse woody debris (CWD) is 1,000 hour dead fuel, with a minimum diameter (or an equivalent cross section) of 3 inches at the widest point and includes sound and rotting logs, standing snags, stumps, and large branches (located above the soil) (Enrong et al. 2006). Fuel conditions resulting from implementation of each of the alternatives would have associated effects on fire behavior. Table 3-8.

FlamMap’s features allow the user to easily characterize potential fire behavior, as well as analyze fire movement and fuel treatment interactions. The fuel models that are used in this analysis are from publication RMRS-GTR-153 (RMRS GTR 153 2005). The fuel models that were used are estimates of what the fuel loading and fire behavior currently are and what is predicted in the future allowing for vegetation regrowth and the falling of dead trees. Fuel models were assigned based on remote sensing, field review of existing conditions, and observations of the effects of past fires on fuel model change within the South Fork and Trinity River management units. Fire behavior modeling uses three primary input variables (fuels, topography, and weather) to calculate fire behavior. Because fuels are the primary variable that management activity can influence it is the variable for this analysis. For modeling purposes the fire weather adjective defined as High (90th percentile weather) was used to predict fire behavior in the analysis area. Remote Automated Weather Stations (RAWS) were used to collect 90th percentile weather data. Due to the fact that RAWS sites in the area have a difficult time modeling herbaceous and live woody fuels, physical samples of woody fuel moisture samples have been taken by local fire personnel at 3 sampling sites on the Forest each field season (May-November) beginning in 2007: one on the South Fork Management Unit, and two on the Trinity River Management Unit. Affected Environment The frequency of low-intensity fires has decreased throughout the west, including portions of the fire area, leaving fuel levels in excess of those that occurred in pre-European times. The accumulation of this woody material may increase the likelihood of severe stand replacing wildfires. Over time, fuels buildups continue and become more continuous in distribution. There is a positive relationship found between fuel loading and fire severity (Schoennagel et al, 2004), and the reduction of both coarse fuels and fine fuels has been found to reduce fire severity during re-burn (Fraver et al 2011). As a consequence, high-severity fires result in generally greater changes in plant compositions and structure than would occur if the communities had been subjected to more frequent low-intensity fires (DeBano et al 1998). Uncharacteristically high fuel levels create the potential for fires that are uncharacteristically intense (Franklin and Agee 2003). Pre-fire Conditions As with many areas in the Klamath Mountain Ecoregion, the landscape through which the Fork Complex, South Complex, Mad River Complex, Route Complex, River Complex, and Saddle Fire burned has been heavily influenced over the last 150 years by past management activities as well as natural occurrences, including: mining, grazing, timber harvesting, fire exclusion, and large high-severity fires (Figure 3-1). At the stand level, the combination of past management activities, fire exclusion, and drought related mortality has created relatively homogeneous areas typified by small trees existing at high densities (Frost and Sweeney 2000). High fuel loads were created by overstocked stands with high accumulations of ladder fuels and canopy fuels (Skinner 1995). Characteristic Fire RegimesForests are characterized by distinct wildfire patterns, defined as fire regimes. Fire regimes are the combination of fire frequency, predictability, intensity, seasonality, and extent characteristic of fire in a particular ecosystem (Barrett et al. 2010, Sugihara et al. 2006). The common fire regimes found within the project area are listed below: I. 199,917 acres are classified as fire regime I. 0 to 35-year frequency and low (surface fires most common) to mixed severity (less than 75 percent of the dominant overstory vegetation replaced); II. 500 acres are classified as fire regime II. 0 to 35-year frequency and high (stand replacement) severity (greater than 75 percent of the dominant overstory vegetation replaced); III. 13,803 acres are classified as fire regime III. 35 to 100 plus year frequency and mixed severity (less than 75 percent of the dominant overstory vegetation replaced); IV. 2,914 acres are classified as fire regime IV. 35 to 100 plus year frequency and high (stand replacement) severity (greater than 75 percent of the dominant overstory vegetation replaced); and, V. 422 acres are classified as fire regime V. 200 plus year frequency and high (stand replacement) severity. Fires in Klamath Mountain ecosystems historically burned at moderate to high frequencies with low to moderate severities (Frost and Sweeney 2000; Skinner et al, 2006; Mallek et al. 2013). During the wildfires of 2015 all fire regimes burned within their range of severities but the scale of these fires were larger. Also, since many portions of the fire had far exceeded their fire return interval, post fire conditions can be expected to still be outside the historic fire return interval. Post-Fire Conditions Recently burned forests can have dense patches of snags, abundant downed logs, montane chaparral patches, and highly variable natural conifer regeneration (Swanson et al. 2010). In the first couple of years post-fire, the area is expected to have low fire behavior due to the lack of available ground fuels to support fire. Within 8 to 12 years, fire-killed vegetation will decay and fall, creating excessive quantities of CWD (Russell et al. 2006, Peterson et al 2015). Live vegetation would continue to grow as well, adding to the fuel loading. This type of fuel loading is modeled as a slash-blowdown fuel type. The rate of accumulation would eventually slow down but the fire behavior would continue to increase as new live vegetation moves into the area and existing live vegetation sheds needles, leaves, limbs, and branch wood adding to the total fuel loading. During potential future fire activity, live vegetation is dried by the fire, making live vegetation available as fuel and further increasing fire behavior. The dead material from the previous fire along with the live vegetation, brush and hardwoods growing back on site would create a fuel bed that will support high fire intensities and flame lengths. Future fire would be expected to burn with high intensities impacting resources and killing most vegetation. Fire behavior would exceed firefighter direct attack capabilities within a few years and suppression efforts would have to use indirect tactics. Figure 3-1 Fire History Map Fire SeverityFire severity is defined as the effect of fire on an ecosystem (Agee, 1993; Sugihara et al., 2006). Often severity is mapped in broad categories such as low, moderate and high representing the sum of effects in all structural strata in the ecosystem (DeBano et al., 1998). For a forested system those strata could include soil, surface fuels, herbaceous layer, understory shrubs, intermediate trees, and dominant and co-dominant trees (Miller and Thode 2007). Table 3-9 and Figure 3-2 show the Fork Complex, South Complex, Mad River Complex, Route Complex, River Complex, and Saddle Fire Vegetation fire Severity. Table 3-9. 2015 wildfire perimeters within the project area Vegetation Burn Severity and acres. Fire Severity  Description  Acres  Low  Fires are generally nonlethal to the dominant vegetation and do not substantially change the structure of the dominant vegetation. Approximately 80 percent or more of the aboveground dominant vegetation survives fires.  258,325  Moderate  Severity of fire either causes selective mortality in dominant vegetation, depending on different tree species’ susceptibility to fire, or varies between understory and stand-replacement.  54,064  High  Fires kill aboveground parts of the dominant vegetation, changing the aboveground structure substantially. Approximately 80 percent or more of the aboveground dominant vegetation is either consumed or dies as a result of fires.  7,473  Following large fires such as those experienced in the summer of 2015, variable severity patterns leave behind different densities of fire killed trees. As these snags fall, they contribute to elevated surface fuels (McIver and Ottmar 2007). As a result, areas that burn at moderate to high severity in one fire are vulnerable to future high severity fires during a reburn event (when one fire burns inside the perimeter of a previous fire) (Ritchie et al. 2013). This vulnerability is directly correlated to remaining stand density of fire killed trees, tree species, time since fire, and postfire events on the landscape (Peterson et al. 2009, Ritchie et al. 2013). Within the project area in the mixed and high severity portions of the fire there is high tree mortality. Overtime these snags will fall and increase CWD. High levels of continuous CWD may result in a fire with high intensity that covers a large area. A fire of this magnitude could result in damage to homes and property, as well as resource damage, and is costly to suppress (Long et al. 2014). In addition, fire suppression actions could be hindered by the fire effects associated with a high loading of CWD (Brown et al. 2003) by slowing fireline production rates and limiting suppression resources to indirect attack with heavy equipment (Andrews et al. 2011). Figure 3-2 Burn Severity Map 61 The literature concerned with postfire landscapes was synthesized recently in Long et al. (2014). Generally, there is growing concern for areas that reburn in previously large patches of moderate to high severity fire for both areas left untreated and areas treated with postfire logging and no post-harvest fuels reduction treatments (Long et al. 2014). Studies at a productive site in Oregon indicated that areas burned at high severity in one fire led to a condition dominated by an early seral condition characterized by shrubs and tree regeneration. These areas had a tendency to burn at high severity in subsequent fires (Thompson and Spies 2010). As in many studies that are retrospective, little knowledge of the first pre-fire area was available and most areas that were considered were salvaged with no post-harvest fuels treatments. Van Wagtendonk et al. (2012) found that post-wildfire fuel loading influences fire intensity and places fire fighter safety at risk by greatly increasing a fire’s resistance to control.  Resistance to control, also called difficulty of control, is the relative difficulty of constructing and holding a control line as affected by resistance to line construction and fire behavior; also called difficulty of control. For example, the 2009 Big Meadows Fire escaped control lines as the fire spotted into natural regeneration and heavy fuels from the 1990 Arch Rock Fire. Snag to snag spotting, well ahead of the main fire, also occurred, carrying fire well outside the ability of firefighters to control. Heavy fuel loading and snags were identified in the fire review as a main contributor to fire intensity and spread. Harrington (1982) and Brown (2003) found that fire-killed trees contribute to extreme fire behavior through production of large amounts of heat energy, which increases extreme fire behavior such as torching, crowning and spotting potential. Fire consumption of these larger fuels increases as decomposition progresses (Knapp et al. 2005, Uzoh and Skinner 2009). Also, once snags and downed logs start to rot, this wood is frequently a source of embers and receptive to embers, especially when dry, leading to fire spread through spotting (Harrington 1982; Brown 2003; Estes et al. 2012). The increased risk of high severity fire in areas that burned at high and moderate severity previously is due primarily to 1) increased fire residence time as heavy fuels have high heat content and burn longer and heat deeper into the soil and 2) reduced fire suppression options due to the heavy fuels and hazard to firefighters from large standing dead trees and logs. Salvage harvest alone does not significantly reduce fire behavior (Donato et al 2006). Post-harvest fuels reduction treatments reduce surface fuels and thus, fire spread and flame lengths. Salvage harvesting with post-harvest fuels reduction in combination have the greatest effect on reducing fire behavior. The reduction in fire behavior increases fire fighter and public safety, increases fire suppression options during wildfire events, and creates safer ingress and egress routes. This project models fire behavior using flame length and fireline intensity under different treatment types. That data then can be interpreted to determine potential suppression tactics. The removal of fire dead and dying trees too include post-harvest fuels treatments will decrease flame lengths and fireline intensities. The risk of the high severity patches in the Fork Complex, South Complex, Mad River Complex, Route Complex, River Complex, and Saddle Fire reburning as high severity patches in future fires is real and significant. The 2015 wildfires reburned over a total of 24 wildfires.  One example of higher severity reburn in the project area is the Saddle fire. Portions of the Saddle fire burned into the Sims Fire, in these areas of overlap the saddle fire burned at higher severities than outside the Sims fire footprint. Other recent examples of reburns in northern California include the Chips Fire (2012) that reburned the Storrie Fire (2000) on the Lassen and Plumas National Forests. Figures 4 and 5 show examples of a burned and reburned area on the Chips Fire. Some lessons may be learned by looking at the overlap between the 2000 Storrie Fire and the 2012 Chips Fire. Following the Storrie Fire, there was some hazard tree removal. There was no salvage logging or fuels treatment on the remainder of the area. Even though the two fires were only 12 years apart, the proportion of high severity within this overlap was still relatively high at 32 percent. In part, some of the high reburn severity in Chips may be a result of the large accumulation of surface fuels and woody debris that resulted from the Storrie fire. Figure 3-3 shows an area that burned at high severity in the Storrie Fire after 12 years; this area was not salvage logged or otherwise treated to reduce fuels post fire. Fuel loads were represented by high snag densities, thick shrubs as high as 5 feet tall, and a complex arrangement of fallen trees, broken tops and branches intermixed and suspended within a heavy shrub component. It is estimated that overall fuel loading was as high as 200 tons per acre. These elevated fuel loads and the associated risk of high severity reburn can persist for more than half a century. Figure 3-4 shows what these same fuel loads looked like 22 days after the Chips Fire passed through on August 1, 2012. Figure 3-4 Same view after the Chips Fire passed through this site August, 2012 Environmental Consequences Direct and Indirect Effects Common to All Action Alternatives Within the treated areas the aerial hazards to the road or operations will be felled. Hazard tree felling along road systems reduces the possibility of falling snag strikes during fire incident response and forest management activities. Vehicle travel safety would increase, and the likelihood of hazard trees falling and blocking roads would be greatly reduced, decreasing response times to future medical and wildfire calls. Following treatment, vehicle access to the area would be less hazardous for firefighters and all forest users. Fireline intensities and flame lengths along system roads would be lower in areas where the CWD would be reduced to 10-20 tons an acre. This residual CWD would be discontinuous and would be at a level that would not significantly influence fire behavior or resistance to control. Suppression actions would not be restricted by fire behavior in these areas; thus direct suppression actions would be possible. Decreased fire intensity and flame length allows for greater probability of fire suppression success, increases fire suppression fire-line production rates, and increases fire management personnel safety. The scale of these beneficial effects vary by alternative in acres and tonnage removed. Removal of hazard trees reduces the amount of available fuels and allows for greater probability of fire suppression success by utilizing road systems for future fire protection lines. Suppression forces would not be hindered by the high density of snags or high levels of CWD in the units which would allow immediate and appropriate action to be taken. Foot travel in the units would be unimpeded except for the occasional large log that would be retained for resource benefit. The reduction in snags would also result in reduced spotting that is associated with snags when they burn. After the initial entry, vegetation will continue to grow, and trees will continue to succumb to fire damage, insects, and disease, and will fall to the ground. These processes will contribute to increasing fuel loading along roads once the initial implementation is complete; however, the planned maintenance would address this condition. Cumulative Effects Common to All Alternatives Six Rivers National Forest, Trinity County, PG&E, and private land inholdings are currently managing their fire damaged lands. Fuels are being modified by timber harvesting and removing hazard trees along roads, power lines, trails, and other infrastructure. These activities will help reduce the likelihood of uncharacteristically severe fire behavior in the future. Projects on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest within the cumulative effects analysis area are the Burnt Ranch Fire Resilient Community, Mud Springs Fuel Break, Sims Fire Restoration -Roadside and Landline Fuels Reduction, Hwy 3 and Hayfork South Fuelbreak, Stafford Fire Salvage and Restoration, Trinity Alps Wilderness Prescribed Fire, Trinity County Transmission Lines Hazard Tree Removal and Salvage, and Westside Plantation Thin projects. The ongoing hazard fuels reduction projects are the Sims Fire Restoration, Mud Springs, Westside Plantation Thin, and South Fuelbreak. These activities will occur on a total of approximately 15,778 acres and will help reduce the likelihood that uncharacteristic fire behavior will occur in the future. Removing hazard trees that threaten infrastructure reduces the excess accumulation of surface fuel loadings. The Burnt Ranch Fire Resilient Community, Trinity County Transmission Lines Hazard Tree Removal and Salvage, and the Trinity Alps Wilderness Prescribed Fire project are in the planning stages at this time. When implemented, these projects will reduce the likelihood that uncharacteristic fire behavior will occur in the future. Alternative 1 (Proposed Action) Direct and Indirect Effects Treatments outside HVWCA’s (High Value Wildlife Conservation Area) are expected to result in between 10 to 20 tons per acre of CWD along 206 miles of open roads. A minimum of 100ft of treatment downhill of the road would be required to contain fires using direct attack with handtools at this level of CWD. This should result in conditions in which suppression resources can directly attack fires, increasing the chance of catching fires in the initial attack phase (Brown et al., 2003). Treatments within HVWCA’s are expected to result in 15 tons per acre or greater of CWD along 27 miles of open roads. This should result in conditions in which fires can be directly attacked with dozers, fire engines, and aircraft increasing the chance of catching these fires in the initial attack phase. Direct attack with handtools is unlikely to be feasible with this amount of fuel loading. When less than 100 feet of buffer falls below the road, fire behavior will exceed initial attack capabilities below the road. In these areas suppression actions will be limited and potentially ineffective. Ingress and egress along these portions of the roads during wildfire events would be limited or not passable at all because of high fire intensities in close proximity to roads. When the buffer extends more than 100’ downhill from the road, fire behavior will be reduced along the road and initial attack suppression capabilities will have a higher probability of success. In these areas suppression forces can attack these fires using handtools and roads should contain the fire. Ingress and egress along these portions of the roads during wildfire events would be passable because of lower fire intensities and flame lengths in close proximity to roads. The variable 300-foot wide buffer in Alternative 1 is expected to slow fire movement under 90th percentile weather conditions. Table 3-10 and Table 3-11 display the projected fire effects for Alternative 1 within all treatments using the FlamMap 5.0 modeling program. Table 3-10 displays the projected fire effects in areas outside HVWCA’s. Table 3-11 displays the projected fire effects in areas inside HVWCA’s. Effective fire suppression beyond year 20 would depend on the proposed maintenance treatments being implemented. Table 3-10. Alternative 1 -Predicted Average Surface Fire Flame Length, Fireline Intensity, and Suppression for treatment units outside HVWCA’s (up to 206 miles of road, 6,990 acres of treatment). Alternative 1  Flame Length  Fireline Intensity  Suppression Actions  1 Year Post-Activity  Less than or equal to 2 feet  Less than or equal to 100 btu/ft/sec44  Fires can generally be attacked at the head or flanks by persons using hand tools.

Hand line cannot be relied on to hold the fire. Equipment such as dozers, pumpers, and retardant aircraft can be effective.  44 With flame lengths less than or equal to 2 feet, the BTU/ft/sec would be less and 100, and with flame lengths less than or equal to 4 feet, the BTU/ft/sec would be close to 100. Cumulative Effects Future wildfires on the landscape level will be affected by the combination of treatments implemented on privately owned lands and those on National Forest System (NFS) lands, including those treated by the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage treatment units. Fuels reduction treatments will occur on 7,968 acres under this alternative, creating a total of 23,746 acres of fuel reduction treatments when combined with other projects in the analysis area; this is more acres treated than alternative 4 and 5, and fewer acres than alternatives 2 and 3. Alternative 2 (Consistent Buffer and Fuelbreaks Alternative) Direct and Indirect Effects Impacts under this alternative are similar to the impacts described under Alternative 1. Differences in impacts and effectiveness of treatments are described below. Under this alternative, the buffer would not vary in distance from the road; it would consistently treat 150 feet below and above the road. Treating the downhill side of roads with a consistent buffer greater than 100 feet will limit the spread and intensity of fires until initial attack units arrive, provide firefighter access to other fire defense systems, and provide a line of defense for control of wildfire. The consistent buffer would allow for safer ingress and egress routes for public and firefighter travel along a greater number of miles than Alternative 1. The consistent 300-foot buffer treatments in Alternative 2 are expected to slow horizontal fire movement under 90th percentile weather conditions. In addition to the consistent buffer, this alternate also includes strategic roadside fuelbreaks. Creating and maintaining fuelbreaks to break up large expanses of continuous fuels would provide for firefighter access and safety, increase suppression opportunities, increase ingress/egress safety for communities and provide pre-existing control points to contain fire near communities. Thinning green trees up to 10” DBH in the fuelbreaks would raise canopy base heights, thereby reducing crown fire initiation which would increase the likelihood that fire will stay as surface fires and not become crown fires. If a fire does get into the crown it would be less likely to be an active crown fire (a crown fire that moves from tree to tree in the crown, consuming the majority of the stand and presenting serious suppression difficulties). Suppression forces could enter these fuelbreaks and take appropriate actions as needed to manage fires. The fuelbreak treatments in Alternative 2 are expected to slow horizontal and vertical fire movement under 90th percentile weather conditions. Table 3-12, Table 3-13, and Table 3-14 display the projected fire effects for Alternative 2 within treatment units using the FlamMap 5.0 modeling program. Table 3-12 displays the projected fire effects in areas outside HVWCA’s. Table 3-14 displays the projected fire effects in areas inside HVWCA’s. Cumulative Effects Future wildfires on the landscape level will be affected by the combination of treatments implemented on privately owned lands and those on National Forest System (NFS) lands, including those treated by the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage treatment units. Fuels reduction treatments will occur on 9,522 acres under this alternative, creating a total of 25,300 acres of fuel reduction treatments when combined with other projects in the analysis area; this is more acres treated than Alternatives 1, 4 and 5, and fewer acres than Alternatives 3. Table 3-12.

Hand line cannot be relied on to hold the fire. Equipment such as dozers, pumpers, and retardant aircraft can be effective.  Alternative 3 (consistent 600 foot wide buffer) Direct and Indirect Effects Impacts under this alternative are similar to the impacts described under Alternative 1. Differences in impacts and effectiveness of treatments are described below. Treating the downhill side of roads to wider consistent buffer will limit the spread and intensity of fires to a greater extent than Alternatives 1 and 2. This reduction in spread and intensity allows more time for initial attack units to arrive, provides firefighter access to other fire defense systems, and provides a line of defense for control of wildfire. The consistent buffer will also allow for safe ingress and egress routes for public and firefighter travel. The consistent 600-foot buffer treatments in Alternative 3 are expected to slow fire movement under 90th percentile weather conditions. Table 3-15 and Table 3-16 display the projected fire effects for Alternative 3 within treatment units using the FlamMap 5.0 modeling program.

Fuels reduction treatments will occur on 15,166 acres under this alternative, creating a total of 30,944 acres of fuel reduction treatments when combined with other projects in the analysis area; this is more acres treated than all other alternatives. Alternative 4 (NSO Alternative) Direct and Indirect Effects Impacts under this alternative are similar to the impacts described under Alternative 1. Differences in impacts and effectiveness of treatments are described below. Treatments outside Important Northern Spotted Owl Habitat would reduce the CWD to between 10 to 20 tons per acre along 175 miles of open roads, similarly to Alternative 1. The 58 miles of roads within suitable northern spotted owl habitat would not have fuels reduction or maintenance treatments. These areas would have fire behavior similar to the No Action alternative, with high flame lengths and fireline intensities limiting fire suppression actions. Wildfires burning in these stands under 90th percentile weather conditions are expected to result in substantial control problems. During wildfire events these portions of the roads would not be safe to use as ingress/egress routes. Aerial hazards to the roads and operations would be felled along all 233 miles of open roads, creating conditions for safe road use during normal conditions. Maintenance treatments described under Alternative 1 would only occur outside of suitable northern spotted owl habitat. Table 3-17 and Table 3-18 display the projected fire effects for Alternative 4 within treatment units using the FlamMap 5.0 modeling program. Table 3-17 display the projected fire effects in areas that fuel reduction treatments are implemented. Table 3-18 displays the projects fire effects in Important Spotted Owl Habitat where only hazard tree felling is permitted. Table 3-17.

Control efforts at the fire head will probably be ineffective.  Year 20  greater than 11 feet  greater than 1,000 btu/ft/sec  Crowning, spotting, and major fire runs are probable. Control efforts at head of fire are ineffective.  Cumulative Effects Future wildfires on the landscape level will be affected by the combination of treatments implemented on privately owned lands and those on National Forest System (NFS) lands, including those treated by the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage treatment units. Fuels reduction treatments will occur on 5,841acres under this alternative, creating a total of 21,619 acres of fuel reduction treatments when combined with other projects in the analysis area; this is more acres than alternative 5, but fewer acres than Alternatives 1, 2, and 3. Alternative 5 (Minimum Impact Alternative) Direct and Indirect Effects Impacts under this alternative are similar to the impacts described under Alternative 1. Differences in impacts and effectiveness of treatments are described below. Treatments would reduce the CWD to between 10 to 20 tons per acre throughout the 300-foot wide buffer along 122 miles of open roads, similarly to Alternative 1. These areas could be directly attacked with suppression resources increasing the chance of catching these fires in the initial attack phase (Brown et al., 2003). The remaining 111 miles of roads within sensitive areas (northern spotted owl suitable habitat, Riparian Reserves, Inventoried Roadless Areas, and At-risk watersheds) would not have fuels reduction or maintenance treatments. These areas would have fire behavior similar to the No Action Alternative. Increased flame lengths and fireline intensities would limit fire suppression actions. These increased flame lengths and intensities are a direct result of fire burning in dead and down logs, branches, and shrubs. During wildfire events these portions of the roads would not be safe to use as ingress/egress routes. Aerial hazards to the road and operations would be felled along all 233 miles of open roads. Maintenance treatments described under Alternative 1 would only occur within the 122 miles of roads with fuels reduction treatments. Table 3-19 and Table 3-20 display the projected fire effects for Alternative 5 within treatment units using the FlamMap 5.0 modeling program.

Fuels reduction treatments will occur on 4,062 acres under this alternative, creating a total of 19,840 acres of fuel reduction treatments when combined with other projects in the analysis area; this is the fewest acres of fuel reduction treatments of all action alternatives. Alternative 6 (No Action) Direct and Indirect Effects Under Alternative 6, no actions would be implemented to address the objectives and desired conditions identified in the Purpose and Need. Existing stand conditions would persist and develop unaltered by active management. Standing hazard trees would remain along roads until they fall by natural causes, and the site would be rapidly colonized by grasses, forbs, and shrubs within three to five years. Figure 3-5 2008 Cedar Fire, photo taken in 2015, showing shrub regeneration and standing Figure 3-6 The 2008 Eagle Fire, photo taken in 2015 showing shrub regeneration and height. It is a reasonable expectation that non-salvaged stands would develop comparable to that of similar non-salvaged stands in nearby fires that burned in the recent past. Examples of such fires include the Lime Complex Fire (2008), Iron Complex Fire (2008), Bake-Oven Fire (2006), Megram Fire (1999), and the Onion Fire (1999). In those areas, grasses such as cheat grass (Bromus tectorum) and shrubs such as Ceanothus (C. cordulatus, C. velutinus) and manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula) species occupy the site. Standing snags dominate the overstory of the high and moderate severity burn areas. Shrub fuels are established within 7 years after the fire. Figure 3-5 shows for the 2008 Cedar Fire, and Figure 3-6 the 2008 Eagle Fire. Hundreds of dead trees and very few live trees per acre characterize the forest structure following a high-intensity fire. Snag fall rates are highest the first ten years within the smaller diameter classes, while larger snags persist for relatively longer time periods, which is generally documented in existing scientific literature (Cluck and Smith 2001). Nearly all snags in the 2015 Fire areas would be expected to fall by 20 years post-fire, contributing to greater fuel loads. The limbs and boles from these fallen trees would accumulate as surface fuels. This fuel is expected to increase each decade as trees fall over. At year 10, surface fuels are projected to average 58 tons per acre. At year 20, surface fuels are projected to average 72 tons per acre with up to 250 tons per acre. In the event of a wildfire this would create serious control problems and high suppression costs, and high volumes of smoke emissions. Increased surface fuels would result in increased flame lengths and higher fireline intensities. These would lead to increased firefighter and public risk, and higher costs. Historically, fires in the project area were low intensity with less than 20 percent of the stand being killed by fire. The scale of historical fires was also much smaller. Fire effects under the No Action Alternative would result in higher stand loss as seen in the Fork Complex, South Complex, Mad River Complex, Route Complex, River Complex, and Saddle Fire, with over 26% percent of the stand killed and at larger scales than historical fire size.. It is expected that some fires, both human and lightning caused, would continue to escape initial attack under more severe weather conditions over the next 20 to 30 years. These fires are expected to kill natural regeneration and residual larger trees. Both grass-forb cover and shrub cover present formidable competition for water and light with tree seedlings. This competing vegetation would likely result in decreased survival of tree seedlings and would inhibit growth for years if not decades. Consequently, the site would likely be occupied by brush intermixed with grass and forbs. The result would be brush fields with high fuel loads. Over time, ladder and crown fuels would develop where natural regeneration was established via seed from surviving mature conifers. Table 3-21 displays predicted flame lengths and fireline intensities. Under Alternative 6, flame lengths exceed 4 feet after five years and are projected to exceed 10 feet within 20 years. Fireline Intensities would exceed 500 BTU per foot per second after five years and are projected to exceed 1,000 BTU per foot per second after 10 years. These increased flame lengths and intensities are a direct result of fire burning in dead and down logs, branches, and shrubs. Fires burning in stands under 90th percentile weather conditions in Alternative 6 are expected to result in substantial control problems. Access to the fire would be restricted by fallen trees across the roads and by standing roadside danger trees. Fire engines would not be able to access fires as rapidly as we have come to expect. Fire size could quickly increase before suppression forces arrive to fight the fire. Fires may be too intense for direct attack on the head by persons using hand tools. Handline may not be relied on to hold the fire. Fires may present substantial control problems such as torching, crowning, and spotting. Control efforts at the fire head will probably be ineffective. Under Alternative 6, the general trend in high flame lengths (greater than 10 feet) and corresponding high fireline intensities are expected to continue at least 20 years into the future. Table 3-21. Alternative 6 -Predicted Average Surface Fire Flame Length, Fireline Intensity, and Suppression Actions. Alternative 6  Flame Length (feet)  Fireline Intensity (BTU/ft/sec)  Fireline Actions  Existing Condition  Less than or equal to 2 feet  100  Fires can generally be attacked at the head or flanks by persons using hand tools. Handline should hold the fire.  Year 5  Less than or equal to 4 feet  500-1,000  Fires are too intense for direct attack on the head by persons using hand tools. Hand line cannot be relied on to hold the fire. Equipment such as dozers, pumpers, and retardant aircraft can be effective.  Year 10  10  Greater than 1,000  Fires may present serious control problems torching, crowning, and spotting. Control efforts at the fire head will probably be ineffective.  Year 20  13  Greater than 1,000  Crowning, spotting, and major fire runs are probable. Control efforts at head of fire are ineffective.  Alternative 6 combined with the high fuel loading left outside the treatment areas would mean that wildfires would cross boundaries with little chance of containing fires under 90th percentile weather conditions. Wildfires would burn until weather conditions changed so effective suppression actions could take place. This is similar to what occurred on many of the 2015 fires. Unmanaged areas will continue to burn with intensities that perpetuate early seral stage development and hinder the development of forested ecosystems. Overall, the No Action Alternative would not reduce potential future surface fuels or predicted fire effects. Cumulative Effects Cumulative effects of the no action alternative come from the interaction of continued growth of fuels and deposition of heavy dead fuels with the reasonably foreseeable actions included in the first section of Chapter 3 of the EIS. The high intensity fire supported by the areas left untreated in this project could reduce the effectiveness of the whole suite of fuel reduction treatments in the event of a future wildfire. If a fire in this area escapes initial control or cannot be managed appropriately due to access issues and high fuel loading, the resulting high intensity fire could damage other vegetation management activities, including destroying recently planted stands, moving around other fuel treatments that would have linked to the treatments in this project and becoming a large campaign fire event that damages thousands to hundreds of thousands of acres. Availability of strategic points to control wildfires on the landscape would be reduced due to extreme fuel loading from hazard trees that were left to fall naturally. Foot travel for fire suppression would be hampered due to increased fuel loading and unsafe working conditions along roads. Hazard trees and large woody debris accumulation may limit fire management suppression opportunities. Alternative 6 would not move us towards meeting the Forest guidelines and direction for fire management Comparison of Alternatives Table 3-22 compares alternatives with respect to fire behavior and fuel loading after treatments. Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Table 3-22.

Of the ~163,000 total acres that burned east of the Six Rivers National Forest, approximately 144,350 acres (or 89%) were on National Forest System lands. According to remotely sensed data (Relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR)), 24% of the total fire area (approximately 33,920 acres) killed greater than or equal to 25% basal area (ft2)45 resulting in considerable losses of forest vegetation. While most of the fire area experienced very low to low severity (76%), additional loss in forested vegetation is expected in these stands over the next 3 to 8 years depending on species, due to secondary mortality connected to the fire stress (Smith and Cluck 2011). Fire impacts are anticipated to have a greater secondary effect on vegetation since trees were already weakened prior to the fires. Upon field verification, less than three months after imagery was analyzed, field data collected in November 2015 showed a 40% increase in basal area46 loss/mortality was observed in field plots within the moderate fire severity class (Class 3; 2575 basal area mortality) indicating greater fire-impacts (65-100%) to existing vegetation (Hamilton 2015). This secondary mortality may be greater than normally seen due to over a decade of drought stress. Table 3-23.

The Relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RnDBR) index was used to create the 4-classes of basal area mortality (ft2 acre-1). RAVG data combined with field data calibration indicates that 24% of the project area is experiencing at least 65% basal area48 loss and many stands (over 10%) have experienced complete mortality. It is anticipated that this higher mortality rate will increase with time. 45 Upon field verification, three months after imagery was analyzed, a 40% increase in basal area loss/mortality (Hamilton 2015) was observed. This data indicates that 24% of the project area is experiencing at least 65% basal area loss and many (over 10% have complete mortality). 46 In the context of RAVG analysis, basal area loss measures the percent change in basal area or tree cover (relative number of live trees on the site) from the pre-fire condition. Basal area loss is reported as four classes of percent change in tree cover and is expressed in square feet. Basal area loss does not describe a permanent loss of basal area within a forest, but simply describes the amount of change in the live tree cover immediately (approximately 30 days after wildfire containment) after a wildfire that undergoes RAVG analysis. 47 Total Acres refers to acres burned on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, not including those on the Six Rivers National Forest. 48 Basal area: The total cross-sectional area of all stems in a stand measured at breast height, and expressed as per unit of land area (typically square feet per acre). Used as a means of describing the average density of a tree stand. Much of the burned area has a hardwood component contributing to vertical structure and species diversity. Generally, hardwoods and shrubs will respond to surface mortality due to moderate and high severity fire by basal sprouting from the root collar within one year following the burn. Shrub and hardwood sprouting, especially oaks, tanoak, big leaf maple, madrone, poison oak, and manzanita was already evident in spring 2016. Table 3-24, Summary of Vegetation Burn Severity* on National Forest System Lands by Cover Type as a percentage of NFS Lands. Cover Type  V.

Vegetation has been modified by past timber harvest activities as well as large scale wildfires (See Figures 1 and 2). Pre-Fire Conditions The project area is broadly located in the Klamath Mixed Conifer forest type which spans the Klamath Region of northern California and southwestern Oregon. The dominant vegetation types within the project area include the mixed conifer and Douglas-fir forest types. Species composition tends to follow elevation and temperature gradients ranging from red fir/white fir at the highest areas to black oak woodland and ponderosa pine/gray pine/chaparral in the lowest, warmest areas of the project area. South-facing slopes are often dominated by large areas of hardwood and chaparral vegetation. Ultramafic sites, such as areas present within the Blue Fire are dominated by Jeffery pine and incense cedar. These areas tend to have low productivity due to topographic position and geologic parent material. Much of the remainder of the affected burned area is highly productive forest due to above average soil quality and high rainfall. Historically, these vegetation types have demonstrated a high capacity to recover from disturbance; however, seed sources play a fundamental role in natural reforestation, and by extension future forest recovery. Areas lacking mature live overstory (especially areas larger than 5-10 acres) are likely to take decades to establish seedlings through natural processes and would benefit from artificial reforestation (planting) in order to more quickly establish forest cover. Stands dominated by hardwoods and/or woody shrub vegetation prior to burning would be a lower priority for reforestation efforts. Table 25 shows the existing (pre-fire) acreage by forest type within the 2015 fires’ footprint. Douglas-fir comprises approximately 78,600 acres, or 55% of the total area affected. Mixed conifer, Douglas-fir/white fir, ultramafic mixed conifer, red fir, and ponderosa pine types total approximately 50,100 acres or another 35% of the forested area affected by the fires. The remainder is primarily characterized by hardwoods and/or shrubs, and occurs primarily on southeast-facing slopes. Hardwoods are also a minor component of many mixed conifer stands throughout the burned area. Table 3-25.

Fire-injured trees may have a reduced probability of survival depending on the level of injury. Most tree mortality takes place within five years post-fire, with the highest levels occurring within the first two years. Fire injuries can also have longer lasting impacts on tree health and may contribute to mortality beyond this time frame, such as if root disease or decay gains entrance to the tree as a result of the injury. In addition, insects in the families Buprestidae, Cerambycidae, and Siricidae are principal colonizers of fire-killed or severely fire-injured trees. Some of these insects are attracted by smoke and will lay eggs on trees that are still smoldering; because they colonize trees that are dead or dying from fire injury, they are not considered a direct threat to tree survival. Bark beetles (primarily Dendroctonus species), in contrast, are more likely to colonize trees that are lightly to moderately fire injured and may kill some trees that might otherwise have survived. Bark beetle activity typically increases and may persist for several years in burned areas. Prior to the 2015 wildfires, the fire area hosted a variety of insects and disease (I&D) agents including Ips, western, and mountain pine beetles, Douglas-fir beetles, fir engravers, defoliators, dwarf mistletoe, white pine blister rust, and Annosus root rots on an endemic49 level. Insect and disease levels were monitored 49 Present, but at low levels and within the Historic Range of Variation. annually with aerial surveys conducted by Forest Health Protection staff as well as documented by Forest personnel during routine project work. The post-fire response of insects and diseases within the fire area will vary between species and depend on a variety of environmental factors including: burn severity, injury to root and bole, residual live tree density, climate, location, and other environmental conditions. Immediate actions (such as salvage removal of infested logs) can be taken to minimize the impacts of existing insect and disease agents, while future actions must be responsive to monitoring results in order to reduce further damage to and loss of forested landscapes. The project area has been experiencing elevated populations of bark beetle in ponderosa and sugar pine populations over the last few years according to annual aerial surveys conducted by the US Forest Service’s Forest Health and Protection Group. Bark beetles are attracted to stressed trees. Populations of western pine beetle are expected to increase within the fire perimeter over the next 5 years as evidence of activity (pitch tubes50 and frass51) is already observable following the initial fire event. Adjacent healthy, uninjured pine, or green trees experiencing low intensity fire, are also likely to experience mortality due to increased bark beetle populations. This may also impact the success of natural regeneration in areas if they attack and subsequently affect potential seed trees. Wood Borers Wood borers are beetles or wasps that live under the bark and inside the wood of trees, and their tunneling activity helps to decompose the tree. Insects in the families Buprestidae, Cerambycidae, and Siricidae are principal colonizers of fire-killed or severely fire-injured trees. Some of these insects are attracted by smoke and will lay eggs on trees that are still smoldering; because they colonize trees that are dead or dying from fire injury, they are not considered a direct threat to tree survival. They do have a substantial effect on merchantability of the wood as they tunnel into sapwood and sometimes into the heartwood and may introduce decay fungi further degrading the wood. Based on the rates of deterioration due to wood borers seen in trees felled for safety reasons, some timber value has already been lost, and the quality of timber continues to decline as time passes. Heterobasidion Root disease Heterobasidion root disease has been documented in mature mixed-conifer stands within and in close proximity to the burn area. It is likely that root rot pockets will expand and increase after the fire as it is known to continue spreading through the roots of recently killed trees. Live trees within and adjacent to these pockets are likely to be infected if injured by other trees falling alongside and down the bole. Heterobasidion root disease is scattered throughout much of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, but is much more common on the east side of the Forest than on the west side or on the Six Rivers National Forest. The areas in and around the five fire footprints have not been intensively surveyed for Heterobasidion root disease, however the California Insect and Disease Atlas (CAIDA) database records reports of Heterobasidion root disease observations (Table 3-27). Table 3-27. Heterobasidion Root Disease (HRD) reports within and outside 2015 Shasta-Trinity National Forest and Six Rivers National Forest fire complex perimeters, from CAIDA database. Fire Complex  # HRD Reports Within Fire Perimeter  Miles To Closest HRD Report  # HRD Reports Within Or Up To 3 Miles Away  # HRD Reports 3-10 Miles Away  # HRD Reports 10-15 Miles Away  Fork  0  1  1  4  1  Route  1  Within  1  1  0  50 A tubular mass of resin, boring dust, and frass that forms on the surface of the bark at the entrance holes of bark beetles. 51 the waste product of insect feeding, composed of plant fragments and insect excrement Fire Complex  # HRD Reports Within Fire Perimeter  Miles To Closest HRD Report  # HRD Reports Within Or Up To 3 Miles Away  # HRD Reports 3-10 Miles Away  # HRD Reports 10-15 Miles Away  South/Saddle  1  Within  1  1  0  Mad River  0  3.5  0  2  2  River  0  7  0  1  0  The CAIDA database showed relatively few Heterobasidion root disease reports in or near the fire complex areas. However, the database showed that the disease has been reported within the perimeters of the Route and South/Saddle Fire Complexes, and has been reported within three miles of the Fork Fire. The nearest reports for the Mad River and River Complex Fires were 3.5 and 7 miles, respectively. Fire suppression efforts cut a considerable number of trees over 14-inches (stump diameter) to reduce risk of fire spread and improve fire-fighter safety. During this time of emergency, stump treatments designed to prevent the spread of HRD that is typical during non-emergency felling (i.e. application of borate compounds) were not utilized. This will likely result in an increase of Heterobasidion root rot through cut stumps. Within 3 miles of recorded or observed sites, hazard tree reduction activities affecting green trees (or trees killed by the fire52) greater than 14-inches (stump diameter) within the fire area should utilize borate-based treatment. Dwarf Mistletoe An endemic level of dwarf mistletoe was present in much of the conifer forest stands within the fire area prior to the fires. While infection levels are relatively low (excluding areas of high infection such as on South Fork Mountain), it is likely that mistletoe persists in areas that were not completely consumed by fire. The most important consideration for mistletoe is how it may impact natural and artificial regeneration efforts. Overstory trees infected with dwarf mistletoe are likely to infect an establishing understory. White Pine Blister Rust White pine blister rust is present in some of the sugar pines within the fire perimeter. It is likely that a flush of Ribes shrubs (the alternate host species) will germinate in areas with high fire severity could spread this disease to residual live sugar pines and future regeneration of sugar pine. Carbon Sequestration and StorageForests sequester carbon from the atmosphere, and in so doing can mitigate the effects of climate change. Coniferous forests contain more than one-third of all carbon stored on land. Forests and long-lived wood products currently offset approximately 340 million tons (310 million metric tons) of U.S. fossil fuel emissions of carbon, an estimated 20 percent of the total (Birdsey et al 2006, Powers et al 2013). Effects of fire on carbon sequestration In the short term, fire can influence the carbon cycle in a number of ways. Fire can affect plant growth directly by killing plants, thereby preventing them from sequestering additional carbon. When smoldering combustion occurs, it can produce charcoal or black carbon, which is the result of incomplete fuel combustion. Carbon in this form is relatively stable and can remain in the system for considerable periods of time (DeLuca and Aplet 2008). When fire consumes vegetation and detritus it releases carbon back to the atmosphere, and it can release nutrients to the soil—potentially increasing post fire vegetation growth. 52 Region 5 direction recommends treatment with borate compounds for 18 months following fire mortality due to moist cambium characteristics. Fire can also provide a competitive advantage for some species, which may have implications for post disturbance productivity as a function of fire frequency and severity. Fire intensity tends to correlate with fire severity. As the energy released during combustion (intensity) increases, the effect that fire has on the system, such as plant mortality (severity), also increases (Keeley 2009). When fire intensity is low and frequency is high, plant mortality rates tend to be low and carbon assimilation is above the rate that carbon is released back to the atmosphere through decomposition of dead plant material. However, when fire intensity is high and frequency is low, plant mortality is high and the balance between carbon assimilation and carbon emission can become negative, making the site a net source of carbon to the atmosphere (Dore et al. 2008, Meigs et al. 2009, Hurteau and Brooks 2011). In fire-prone forested systems, fire was more prevalent in the past than it is today (Stephens et al. 2007). These fires, whether natural or human caused, released considerable amounts of carbon to the atmosphere. Estimated pre-1800 fire emissions of carbon dioxide from forests in California range from 23.1to 62.6 teragrams (Tg) carbon dioxide per year (Stephens et al. 2007). The average annual estimate of carbon dioxide emissions from fire in California from 2001 to 2008 was 17.8 Tg carbon dioxide per year. However, 2008 had substantially higher emissions (54.5 Tg carbon dioxide) as a result of a large number of lightning-ignited fires (Wiedinmyer and Hurteau 2010). Generally, California is within its historical range, even with increased fire activity (Hurteau and Brooks 2011). Figure 3-7 Hypothetical cycle of forest carbon through a fire cycle with tree regeneration (Fire Science Brief, Jan 2010). In the longer term, stands that burned at moderate to high severity will continue to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere for at least four to ten years following fire, and sometimes much more if poor regeneration is present. Following high intensity fire, in the absence of tree planting, the potential exists for type conversion from forest to a different vegetation type (e.g., shrubland or grassland) (MacDonald and Abbott 1997; Savage and Mast 2005). Lack of tree regeneration in favor of shrubs or grasses results in a diminished capacity to sequester carbon (Savage and Mast 2005). Thus, the long-term effects of high-severity fire and the potential for type conversion have substantial implications for the carbon balance (Hurteau and Brooks 2011). Carbon sequestration and storage Carbon sequestration is the rate of annual transfer between atmosphere and biosphere, while carbon storage refers to the size of the carbon pool at a point in time. As indicated above, fire killed trees are an atmospheric source of carbon, and it isn’t until regeneration takes hold that the stands become a sink for carbon. Large snags and large down wood hold carbon longer than small diameter surface fuels, but commercially processed wood stores carbon even longer than snags and down wood (e.g commercially processed wood has a decomposition rate of less than 1% per year (Birdsey 1996, in Zhang et al. 2008)). However, however fire-killed trees lose all commercial value within 3 years following fire (California Stewardship Program 2002, in Zhang et al. 2008), thereby eliminating the most effective method for carbon storage. Within the areas affected by the 2015 fires, approximately 22,000 acres have had some kind of silvicultural activity, including timber harvest, salvage, or mechanical fuels reduction since 1950. Past timber harvest and wildfires have contributed to creation of approximately 16,000 acres of plantations. Within these plantations, about 2,600 have been pre-commercially treated. The combination of fire suppression/exclusion over the last years with limited (recent) vegetation management actions have led to a marked accumulation of live and dead fuels on the Forest. This accumulation of fuels and drought conditions contributed to its vulnerability to mortality during the 2015 fire event. Methodology As cutting dead trees along linear features with or without removal will not affect directly and/or appreciably contribute to or detract from ecological restoration, elements that will be followed through analysis include: • Hazards to Public Safety; • Threats from Insects and Disease; • Future Forest Structure/Productivity; and. • Carbon Sequestration and Storage The cumulative effects for this analysis are bounded by the 163,000-acre fire footprint areas, including the footprint of all lands (National Forest System and private lands) that burned on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in summer of 2015, as that is the only area where forest structure would be altered. The time period used to analyze cumulative effects regarding forest structure is ten years, as it is estimated to take this long for vegetation to begin to recover and most trees to fail, resulting in a hazardous situation for users as well as high surface fuel levels affecting future fire management. In addition, it is assumed that trees will continue to die (secondary mortality) from factors related to the fires for up to 8 years, depending on species. Salvage harvests on adjacent private land contribute to the mosaic of habitat, a reduction of down woody debris (by removing standing dead), improvement of public safety on roads through private land, and are likely to affect future fire behavior. Environmental Consequences Direct and Indirect Effects Common to all Action Alternative (Alternative 1-5)Trees identified as hazards along open NFS roads would be selected and felled, improving public safety along travelways by eliminating threats to human life and/or property. As the 2015 wildfires weakened the structural integrity of many trees, there is a need to reduce the dangers created by the dead, structurally defective, or otherwise hazardous trees along NFS roads to allow for safe travel. While planting following harvest increases carbon sequestration in the long-term to levels exceeding that of no management, due to the minimal treatment area (<1 to 5% of fire affected area), there will be minimal overall effect to carbon sequestration across the landscape. While salvage harvest decreases on-site carbon storage in the short term (prior to establishment of a new forest with mature trees), in the long-term areas salvaged and replanted are expected to exceed carbon storage when compared to those areas that are not managed. However, due to the minimal treatment area (<1 to 5% of fire affected area), there will be minimal overall effect to carbon storage across the landscape. In addition, while salvage logging results in the loss of carbon at the stand level, this fails to take in to account the preservation of carbon storage within processed logs. Bark Beetles Large-scale removal of infested trees reduces the overall numbers of bark beetles within areas especially vulnerable to beetle attack (i.e. post-fire landscapes). However, due to the minimal treatment area (<1 to 5% of fire affected area), there will be a minimal overall effect to bark beetle population reductions, regardless of alternative. Alternative 1 – Proposed Action Forest Structure Dead trees eventually decay and fall to the ground at varying rates depending on degree of injury, size, species, etc. (Ritchie 2013). The felling of dead hazard trees expedites the process that would have occurred naturally, redistributing standing snags as coarse woody debris53. Wood products milled or otherwise utilized, result in reduced costs to the government (and subsequently the taxpayer) to accomplish project goals, utilization of local timber industry infrastructure, reduction in surface fuels, and serve as an effective sequestration of carbon. Reforestation would occur within the road buffer in forested areas that experienced moderate to high burn severity, thereby largely losing the overstory (i.e. sources of natural seed). Within five years after planting, there is an expected mortality rate of approximately 30%, which may vary depending on weather/drought conditions and site. Live planted seedlings would be manually released (removal of competing vegetation by hand, not chemically) to aid in seedling survival within ten years following planting. Alternative 2 – Consistent Buffer and Fuelbreaks Alternative Forest Structure Effects discussed in Alternative 1 are comparable to Alternative 2 except the scale is greater due to approximately 5,300 acres (including approximately 950 disaggregated acres of concentrated higher density) of salvage treatment instead of approximately 4,100 under Alternative 1 due to the addition of fuelbreak treatments. Reforestation would occur within the road buffer and fuelbreaks in areas salvaged as well as areas other historically forested areas Reforestation spacing could vary between 15-feet by 15-feet to 30-feet by 30-feet depending on site condition, terrain and existing vegetation. By utilizing a slightly denser spacing, trees will have an opportunity to shade out competition as they grow, thereby improving the likelihood of reaching mature forested conditions (Conard and Radosevich 1982; Erickson and Harrington 2006). 53 In some areas over time , this coarse woody debris will exceed 250 tons/ac (see fuels report) resulting in very high fuel loading. Safety Live fire-injured trees meeting the criteria outlined with a 60% chance of dying within five years would be felled and potentially removed. The benefit of utilizing the California Salvage Guidelines (Smith and Cluck 2011) in conjunction with the Hazard Tree Guidelines is a more thorough reduction of hazard trees by reducing the number of potential future hazard trees than under Alternative 1.  By identifying those trees predicted to expire and create a hazard in the near future, Alternative 2 will have a lower administrative burden and cost of out-year maintenance. In addition, more trees (increased volume) of a higher quality is anticipated for salvage units by including injured trees with some green/live characteristics. Alternative 3 – Wider Buffer Alternative Forest Structure Effects discussed in Alternative 1 are comparable to Alternative 3 except the scale is greater under Alternative 3 due to approximately 7,700 acres (including approximately 1350 disaggregated acres of concentrated higher density) of salvage treatments utilizing the wider buffer, instead of approximately only 4,100 acres of treatment in Alternative 1. Reforestation criteria and effects would be comparable to Alternative 1, except for increased scale due to the wider treatment buffer. Safety As this Alternative also utilizes the California Salvage Guidelines, utilizing a probability of mortality of 0.6in conjunction with the Hazard Tree Guidelines, this Alternative would have an increased (more thorough) level of safety comparable to the effect of implementing Alternative 2 to users of National Forest System roads Alternative 4 – Northern Spotted Owl Alternative Forest Structure Effects discussed in Alternative 1 are comparable to Alternative 4 except the scale is reduced due to approximately 800 acres (including approximately 110 disaggregated acres of concentrated higher density) of salvage treatment instead of approximately 4,100 in Alternative 1. Due to the substantially smaller area, there will be little carbon sequestration into wood products. Reforestation criteria and effects would be comparable to Alternative 1, except for increased fuel in the form of large woody debris in areas not salvaged. This quantity of large wood may result in fewer available/ appropriate planting locations and increase vulnerability of loss in the event of future fires. Alternative 5 – Minimum Impact Alternative Forest Structure Consistent with Alternative 1 (as well as the other action alternatives), dead trees eventually decay and fall to the ground at varying rates depending on degree of injury, size, species, etc (Ritchie 2013). The felling of dead hazard trees expedites the process that would have occurred naturally, redistributing standing snags as coarse woody debris. What is different under this alternative, is there would be no commercial removal of these logs. Similarly to the 136,000 acres that burned and are having no treatments, no salvage would occur in areas of highly concentrated coarse woody debris, even when levels exceed 100 tons/ac. While available for personal use firewood permits comparable to any other open firewood area, no wood products would be milled, resulting in excessive fuel loading remainingon site and higher costs to the government (and subsequently the taxpayer) to accomplish project goals. Reforestation criteria and effects would be comparable to Alternative 1, except for increased fuel in the form of large woody debris as this alternative does not include salvage. This quantity of large wood may result in fewer available/appropriate planting locations. As trees would be inter-planted between large down logs, there is greater risk of loss to the developing forest as seedlings are subject to loss from future wildfire, than if fuels had been treated/salvage had occurred (UC Davis, 2009). Alternative 6 – No Action There would be no felling of hazard trees to improve safe passage on National Forest System roads. There would be no recovery of the economic value of any of the fire killed trees. There would not be any increased risk of spread of Heterobasidion root rot due to cut stumps. Sequestered carbon would decompose in the natural elements. Cumulative Effects Current and future projects within the areas affected by this project are also largely focused on post-fire reforestation (i.e. 2015 Fire Reforestation), post-fire hazard tree removal along transmission lines (i.e. PG&E Hazard Tree Salvage), post-fire removal of vegetation felled during suppression activities (i.e. Roadside Decks Salvage), and projects aimed at contributing to a more resilient forested condition (i.e. Westside Plantation Thin, Middle Hayfork Precommercial Thin, Burnt Ranch Fire Resilient Community, Trinity Alps Prescribed Burn, Gemmill Thin). A list of cumulative effects including projects from the recent (last 20 years) past within the fire footprints, as well as current and future projects are included in the beginning of Chapter 3 of the EIS. As the 2015 wildfires have had the greatest effect on the current conditions including the purpose and need for this project and effect the post-implementation desired condition, the existing and compounding effects of the fires are expanded upon in greater detail below. Effect of 2015 Trinity Wildfires Common to All Alternatives Forest Structure The vegetation impacted during the fire and the vegetation removed by this project would have a cumulative effect on forest structure in the project area. Natural revegetation of the burned areas within the project area, especially outside of treatment areas, will occur to a small degree over time, primarily with forbs and shrubs; forested conditions in areas burned at high severity are unlikely to occur for 20100 years (reference if possible). For the larger, high severity burned areas, reforestation will take a long period of time due, in part, to the distance from seed sources as well as a potential decrease in soil productivity/fertility. It is expected that hardwoods and shrubs will resprout vigorously throughout the recovery area. After fire mortality has ceased, large areas in all land allocations severely-affected by the fires would be understocked or unstocked for forest development and associated timber production for many decades (Clark 2009; Ouzts et al. 2015). Reforestation within areas burned in 2015 beyond the project treatment area is a future foreseeable action that would reduce the impacts of the 2015 wildfires and begin a trajectory of future stand recovery. Cumulatively, the number of acres reforested between this project and the reforestation project is expected to be approximately 11,000 acres across all fire areas. Insects and Disease Additional trees will be killed by insects within and adjacent to the fire area for 3 to 8 years, depending on species (Smith and Cluck 2011). The perimeter of intensely burned stands and interior islands of partially scorched trees are most susceptible to attack by bark beetles. Other factors affecting susceptibility include site quality, tree size, stand density, weather/drought and presence of other pathogens. The amount of tree removal in the project would slightly decrease bark beetle populations but is not likely to influence these trends of forest mortality in the burned area due to the small area planned for treatment (and the large area of burned trees unaffected by this or any other foreseeable project); therefore, it is unlikely that the project will noticeably reduce bark beetle mortality even when taking into account all salvage efforts within the fire footprint. The effects of fire suppression may affect the spread of Heterobasidion root disease, as treatment of stumps with a borate compound is not required in the event of an emergency. Therefore trees felled during fire suppression and management activities may have served as sources of Heterobasidion infection. The project is not expected to cumulatively add to this increase in Heterobasidion root disease due to the planned borate treatment of cut stumps. Where it is able, the distribution of vegetation in California is expected to move upslope and poleward in response to climate change (Hayhoe et al. 2004, Loarie et al. 2008). While such long-term shifts are difficult to observe, observations of short-term shifts in response to drought and climate variability can offer us insight into the trends we are likely to see under warmer and (potentially) drier climates. In response to these shifting species distribution predictions, planting associated with this project will include seed sown from generally one elevational band (500-feet) lower, and within the same seed zone. This will allow for a more hardy transition to a warmer climate as trees mature (Millar et al 2007). In addition, healthy and diverse forest stands have a greater likelihood for adaptability into the future (Anderson and Palik 2011). Reforestation for this project will include a species mixture consistent with historic and natural conditions, including a mixture of Douglas-fir, ponderosa or Jeffery pine, incense cedar, sugar pine, white fir and red fir (South Fork Mountain only). No Action Insect and Disease Alternative 6 (No Action) has the greatest risk of bark beetle population increases, primarily because all stressed trees remain. Safety Alternative 6 (No Action) has the greatest risk to users of the National Forest System lands and roads. As no hazard trees would be mitigated (except for along PG&E transmission lines analyzed under a separate project), there is cumulative risk to users as time passes and more trees die, decay and fall. Forest Structure The cumulative effect of the no action alternative with the effects of the 2015 fires on forest structure is a shift from mature forests toward early seral and type conversions to brush fields. Action Alternatives (Alternative 1-5) Safety Cumulatively, implementation of all action alternatives combined with private land salvage and hazard tree abatement on adjacent timber industry lands would result in a project area safe for travel on roads open to the public. This is because all action alternatives mitigate the immediate threat of hazard trees, to varying degrees (Alternatives 2 and 3 are more thorough due to the incorporation of California Salvage Guidelines and larger treatment footprints). Heterobasidion Root Rot While stumps would likely be treated on both NFS and privately managed timber lands, more exposed stumps increases the likelihood of spread of the root disease. However, by applying borate compound on stumps greater than 14-inches, the threat of infection is not appreciably greater with implementation of any action alternative. Forest Structure Utilizing artificial reforestation (under this project as well as the post-fire reforestation project) combined with fuels treatments and taking into account comparable activities on private lands and will result in a trajectory to maintain forest cover where planted. In addition, projects such as Gemmill Thin, Middle Hayfork Precommercial Thin, Westside Plantation Thin, Burnt Ranch, etc. will improve diversity of the landscape by reducing overstocked stands thereby improving the likelihood of future maintenance of forested conditions in the event of a wildfire. Wildlife ____________________________________ Northern Spotted Owl Introduction A comprehensive analysis of wildlife species occurrence, habitat, and effects of the Trinity Post-fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage (TPFHR&S) project are included in the following documents: • The TPFHR&S Project Wildlife Biological Assessment • The TPFHR&S Project Wildlife Biological Evaluation • The TPFHR&S Project-level Management Indicator Assemblage Report • The TPFHR&S Project Wildlife Survey and Manage Report • The TPFHR&S Project Migratory Bird Report • The TPFHR&S Project Wildlife Report Proposed Actions and Alternatives Analyzed For a detailed description of the alternatives considered for this analysis, please see Chapter 2. Methodology This analysis is based on species occurrence data documented in National Forest wildlife databases (Shasta-Trinity and Six Rivers National Forests) and the California Natural Diversity Database, maintained by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. For this analysis, potential effects were assessed based primarily on the likelihood and intensity of effects to habitat characteristics beneficial to these species. The specific methodologies used are the same as those described in the documents listed in the Introduction. NSO Determination Criteria The determination criteria in the wildlife Biological Assessment (Biological Assessment) uses a systematic approach that relates NSO survival and reproduction to habitat quantity, quality and distribution. Each territory was given an effects determination of: 1) “likely to adversely affect” (LAA); 2) “may effect, but not likely to adversely affect” (MANLAA); or 3) “no effect” (NE) based on the environmental consequences of the various alternatives. Where the determination criteria were not sufficient to decisively establish an effects determination, further evaluation of site specific factors were conducted. The primary purpose of these criteria is to determine if a territory is Likely to be Adversely Affected (LAA) by the proposed activities. As such, they are termed LAA determination criteria. They determine the changes that may reduce the potential of a territory to support NSO at the following levels, listed below from highest to lowest suitability: 1. Capable of supporting successful NSO nesting and reproduction. 2. Capable of supporting a resident pair or single NSO, but not to support successful reproduction. 3. Not capable of supporting NSO. Changes that would reduce the potential for a territory from a higher to lower level of suitability for NSO, as defined above, are determined to likely adversely affect NSO. Lesser effects that are not insignificant or discountable are also determined to likely adversely affect NSO. Any variation from strict application of these criteria is assessed and documented in the “Rationale for determination” section. Post-fire foraging (PFF) habitats are areas that were suitable as NSO NRF habitat pre-fire but no longer meet the definition of NRF habitat because of the effects of the wildfires. PFF is considered to be useful for foraging by NSO, and impacts to PFF are deemed detrimental; therefore, degradation/removal of PFF is considered here to be an important factor in assessing potential effects to NSO and assigning effect determinations for individual NSO territories. LAA determination criterion #1:Will treatments result in the core54 falling below 50% NRF+PFF155 and/or the territory falling below 40% NRF+PFF1? If ‘Yes’, then the territory may not contain enough habitat after project implementation to support occupancy and reproduction. This would result in a LAA determination for that territory unless otherwise noted. LAA determination criterion #2:Will treatments result in the core and home range combined falling below 20% NRF+PFF1? If ‘Yes’, then the territory may be affected to the extent that it can no longer support occupancy by even non-breeding individual (resident single) NSO. This would result in a LAA determination for that territory unless otherwise noted. LAA determination criterion #3:Within a NSO core viable for reproduction (at least 40% NRF+PFF1 in the core and 30% in the territory), will any area that is designated as “selected for” (or “highly selected for”) in RHS56 and mapped as suitable NRF be subject to loud and continuous noise disturbance during the NSO breeding season? If ‘Yes’, then treatment will result in a LAA for that territory, unless otherwise noted. Project resource protection measures (RPM’s) require NSO pre-disturbance searches of all high-value NSO cores in the designated LOP exemption areas, and application of LOP’s if nesting is observed or searches cannot be completed. As a result, the LAA determination for disturbance will not apply to these territories. In additionto the determination criteria listed above, owl territories that have more than a minimal amount of suitable habitat affected by project activities may be adversely affected even if little or no habitat is downgraded or removed. STNF and the Yreka Office of the US Fish and Wildlife Service (YFWO) used ESA criteria to establish a minimum threshold of habitat effects that would merit a more in-depth analysis. As defined in the ESA, a discountable effect is extremely unlikely to occur, and based on best judgment, a person will not expect these effects to occur. Insignificant effects relate to the size of the impact and will not be expected to reach the scale where NSO “take” occurs. A person using the best available data will not be able to meaningfully measure, detect or evaluate insignificant effects. Effects meeting these definitions are not likely to adversely affect the listed species. As a result of this collaborative process, all territories where more than 5% of the core and/or the territory as a whole consists of NRF or PFF1 habitat that may be negatively affected by project activities receive a more detailed analysis. Five percent is the minimal figure below which STNF and YFWO determined that potential effects would be insignificant or discountable. Primary factors considered in these analyses include the total amount of habitat affected, the distribution of this habitat in the core and territory, its proximity to the activity center, and its slope position. Other major factors considered are the RPM’s that have been incorporated into the project design. RPM’s decrease the potential effects to NSO habitat suitability in many areas by prohibiting or limiting salvage opportunities, and requiring a higher level of coarse woody debris (CWD) retention. 54 “Core” and “core area” are used interchangeably.  This is the area within 0.5 mile of an NSO activity center (~503 acres). Territory (aka home range): The area within 1.3 miles of an NSO activity center (~3,400 acres). The terms home range and territory are often used interchangeably. 55 Post-fire foraging type 1 (PFF1) areas are NSO nesting/roosting or foraging (NRF) habitats that were affected by moderate-or high-severity fire but are within 500 feet of currently suitable (surviving) NRF habitats. 56 Relative Habitat Suitability (RHS) modeling was developed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to identify areas most likely to support NSO survival and reproduction. It incorporates documented NSO occurrences as well as abiotic factors such as slope position, proximity to water, and habitat suitability in adjacent areas. RHS modeling was a key component of the review and revision of the NSO Revised Recovery Plan and NSO Critical Habitat designation, completed by FWS in 2011 and 2012, respectively. RHS identifies lands as either highly selected for, selected for, selected against, or highly selected against (by NSO). Affected environment The analysis area covers a large portion of the South Fork and Trinity River Management Units, and vegetative communities are highly variable across this area. The most common vegetation types are typified by mixed conifers in the overstory, oaks and other hardwoods in the understory, and shrubs, forbs and grasses comprising the ground cover. The mixed conifer forests in the action area are typically dominated by Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine and incense cedar. Higher-elevation sites provide favorable conditions for white fir, and the high-elevation sites on South Fork Mountain support forests dominated by red fir. Common hardwood trees in the understory of conifer forests in the action area include Pacific madrone, California black oak, canyon live oak, Oregon white oak and alder. Many sites with shallow, rocky soils and southerly and westerly aspects have harsh growing conditions. As a result, the primary vegetation in many of these areas consists of oaks, shrubs, forbs and grasses rather than coniferous trees. The wildfires of 2015 burned approximately 144,000 acres on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. All proposed treatment areas are within the perimeters of these wildfires. Proposed treatments are spread widely across this area, with highly variable vegetative conditions ranging from old-growth conifer forest to high-severity fire areas with little living vegetation. Fire severity was typically lower in areas dominated by late-seral forest vegetation, and higher in early-seral habitats. NSO habitat needs The key limiting habitat for this species is nesting habitat, which is generally limited to late seral forests that contain suitable nesting platform structures such as cavities, broken tree tops, and mistletoe brooms (Forsman et al. 1984; Gutierrez et al. 1995; Courtney et al. 2004). Many studies conducted during decades of research have documented that northern spotted owl survival and occupancy are positively correlated with increased amounts of late-successional forest. Forest stands used by the owl usually have a high canopy closure and high structural diversity (Dugger et al. 2005, Forsman et al. 1984, Thomas et al. 1990). Small mammals such as the dusky-footed woodrat comprise the bulk of their diet though other mammals, birds, reptiles and insects are also preyed upon. Descriptions of foraging habitat range from forest stands with complex structure to forests with lower canopy closure and smaller diameter trees than those associated with nesting/roosting habitat (Thomas et al. 1990, USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2008a, Solis and Gutierrez 1990, Gutierrez 1996). Dispersal habitat, at a minimum, consists of stands with adequate tree size and canopy closure to provide protection from avian predators. Fledgling owls disperse from nest territories typically from September to November (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2008a). Critical Habitat consists of specific geographic areas that contain features essential for the conservation of a threatened or endangered species and that may require special management and protection (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2008a). Direct effects to designated Critical Habitat are those effects that would alter the current suitability of the habitat to maintain Physical and Biological Features (PBFs) or that would affect the potential of the area to develop and maintain these features. Although indirect effects to a species through habitat manipulation do not occur if the animal is not present, effects to Critical Habitat may occur regardless of the presence or absence of the listed species. Environmental Consequences Effects to Northern Spotted Owls (NSO’s) The only species listed under the Federal Endangered Species Act and present in the project area is the northern spotted owl (NSO). The project wildlife Biological assessment includes a detailed description of NSO life history and habitat needs, and an analysis of the effects of the proposed action (Alternative 1) on NSO and NSO Critical Habitat. Alternative 1 -Proposed Action This alternative allows treatments of a 300-foot total width buffer (up to 275 feet on one side of the road, and a minimum of 25 feet on the other side). The width of the buffer on either side of the road could change but would not exceed 300 feet; i.e. if conditions lend to a wider treatment on the uphill side, the uphill side may be treated up to 275 feet from the road and the downhill side would be treated 25 feet from the road. The minimum treatment area along either side of the road will be 25 feet. The maximum area of treatment is approximately 8,000 acres. Because the exact location of treatment at any given point along a road is unknown, this analysis assumes treatment of the entire 600-foot width within which treatments may occur. This will result in roughly twice the number of acres analyzed as will actually be treated, and as a result this analysis greatly overestimates the potential effects to NSO. Potential effects of Alternative 1 on this species are analyzed in detail in the wildlife Biological Assessment and incorporated into this document by reference. Briefly, the determination for 7 of the 92 NSO activity centers in the action area is “May Affect, Likely to Adversely Affect” (MALAA) for one or more of the following reasons: • Exemptions to the limited operating periods incorporated into the project design may not prevent disturbance or direct effects to NSO that would affect their ability to nest and rear young successfully (3 NSO territories). • Effects to nesting/roosting and foraging (NRF) and/or post-fire foraging type 1 (PFF1) habitats are substantial in scope and scale within the NSO territory, and project resource protection measures (RPM’s) do not reduce these effects to the point that they are insignificant or discountable (4 NSO territories). • The combined effects of the proposed action and reasonably foreseeable non-federal actions may result in effects to NRF and/or PFF1 habitats that are not insignificant or discountable (1 NSO territory) (see wildlife BA). • The determination for the remaining 85 NSO activity centers in the action area is “May Affect, Not Likely to Adversely Affect” (MANLAA) for the following reasons: • Nesting/roosting, foraging and dispersal habitats will be degraded by project activities, but none of these habitats will be downgraded or removed.57. • Effects are not expected to reduce any of these NSO territories below their current capacity to support NSO survival/reproduction (i.e., convert nesting territories to territories supporting only non-nesting pairs or singles, or convert non-nesting territories to territories not capable of supporting even single NSO’s). • Project design features will decrease the potential effects of treatments in areas of high value to NSO’s, especially in nesting/roosting and foraging habitats. • Limited operating periods are incorporated into the project design to reduce disturbance or direct effects to NSO that would potentially impact nesting and rearing of young. Alternative 2 The actual effects of Alternative 2 on NSO in the non-fuelbreak areas will be similar to those of Alternative 1. The same types of treatments will occur, and approximately the same number of acres will 57 The term degrade signifies when treatments influence the quality of habitat by the removal or reduction of habitat elements but not to the degree where existing habitat function is changed. The term downgrade applies to treatments that reduce habitat elements to the degree the habitat will not function in the capacity that exists pre-treatment, but activities will not remove habitat entirely (i.e., downgrade from nesting/roosting to foraging). The term removed pertains to treatments that reduce habitat elements to the degree that habitat will no longer function as suitable for NSO. actually be affected. Removal of dying hazard trees in addition to dead trees will increase effects to NSO habitat suitability compared to Alternative 1, but the overall post-implementation habitat functionality is likely to be the same (i.e. NRF habitats will be degraded by the proposed treatments, and PFF1 habitats will be removed). Because this alternative includes fuelbreaks on approximately 16 miles of roads, tree removal will occur on more acres than under Alternative 1. As a result, CWD in the form of logs and snags will be reduced on a larger number of acres. However, the project resource protection measures detailed under Alternative 1, including the CWD retention measures, will also apply within the fuelbreak treatment areas. These measures will ensure retention of large amounts of CWD, an important habitat element for NSO prey species. The restriction of live tree removal to trees 10” DBH or less in the fuelbreak areas will greatly limit potential reduction in canopy cover, especially in the late-seral forests that are most suitable for this species. The canopy in these stands is dominated by large-diameter trees, and removal of small-diameter trees will have little effect on overall canopy cover levels. Pruning lower branches of live trees is expected to have no measurable effect on canopy cover or any other habitat element important to NSO’s. The NSO territories that include fuelbreak treatments are assessed here individually because the fuelbreaks are wider than the treatment areas proposed in Alternative 1, and may have a greater effect on NSO. Those with a LAA determination under Alternative 1 are also assessed here to identify potential differences between these two alternatives. Although the actual effects of non-fuelbreak treatments will be very similar between Alternatives 1 and 2, a wider buffer of potential treatments was assessed in Alternative 1. As a result, the calculation of effects on individual NSO territories may be greater or lesser under Alternative 2 than under Alternative 1.  Overall, two NSO territories (TRI0023 and TRI0258) that have MANLAA determinations under Alternative 1 would have LAA determinations under Alternative 2, and one territory (TRI0480) with a LAA under Alternative 1 would have a MANLAA under Alternative 2 (Table 3-28). Table 3-28.

These treatments are not likely to adversely affect NSO for the following reasons: Only 6.8% of the core is NRF+PFF1 in potential treatment areas, none of which is nesting/roosting habitat. No treatments are proposed near the activity center. The closest treatments are on a ridge top approximately 0.28 mi to the west. 89.4% of the NRF in the core will remain untreated. Treatments will not downgrade or remove any NRF habitat.  TRI0023  LAA  No LAA determination criteria met, but the 5% threshold for further analysis is met. 88 acres NRF treated in territory, 48 in core.

Twenty of the 112 acres are PFF1, and the other 92 acres are NRF. The remaining acres in the territory are non-NRF/PFF1, and/or not proposed for potential treatment. Of the 503 acres in the core, 34 are NRF or PFF1 that will potentially be treated, 9 of which are PFF1. NSO territory  Determination  Rationale for determination  territory, none in core). 9.5% of the core is NRF in potential treatment areas. These treatments are likely to adversely affect NSO for the following reason: 27.7% of the nesting/roosting habitat in the core is subject to treatments, including the activity center itself (a 2011 nest grove). None of this habitat is subject to RPM’s restricting salvage or requiring a higher level of CWD retention. As a result, project effects to nesting/roosting habitat in the core area may have an effect on NSO that is not insignificant or discountable.  TRI0043  MANLAA  No LAA determination criteria met. No NRF or PFF1 treated.  TRI0054  LAA  No LAA determination criteria met, but the 5% threshold for further analysis is met. 196 acres NRF+PFF1 treated in territory, 61 in core. (3 acres PFF1 treated in territory, none in core). 12.0% of the core is NRF in potential treatment areas. 5.8% of the territory is NRF or PFF1 in potential treatment areas. These treatments are likely to adversely affect NSO for the following reasons: 36.1% of the nesting/roosting habitat in the core area is potentially subject to treatment, and only 3.9% of that will have RPM’s restricting salvage or requiring a higher level of CWD retention. Although RPM’s will decrease potential effects to some nesting/roosting habitats in the territory as a whole, the majority is not within HVWCA’s59 and will not have the enhanced protections that apply within these areas. As a result of these factors, effects to nesting/roosting habitat may have an effect on NSO that is not insignificant or discountable.  TRI0084  MANLAA  No LAA determination criteria met. 53 acres NRF+PFF1 treated in territory, none in core.  TRI0119  MANLAA  No LAA determination criteria met, but the 5% threshold for further analysis is met. 198 acres NRF+PFF1 treated in territory, 34 in core. (32 acres PFF1 treated in territory, 10 in core). 6.7% of the core is NRF or PFF1 in potential treatment areas. 5.9% of the overall territory is NRF or PFF1 in potential treatment areas. These treatments are not likely to adversely affect NSO for the following reasons: The core treatments are all on the edges of the large block of NRF habitat around the nest site, and none of the treatments are near the nest site itself. The closest treatments are approximately 0.25 mi north of the activity center, a 2011 nest site. The core treatments are all on or near ridgetops, and well away from the creek bottom location of the nest grove. 35.8% of the NRF+PFF1 potentially treated is subject to RPM’s restricting salvage or requiring a higher level of CWD retention. Treatments will not downgrade or remove any NRF habitats within the core  59 High-Value Wildlife Conservation Areas (HVWCA’s) are defined as areas preferable to NSO and: 1. Within an NSO Critical Habitat Unit; or 2. Within a core area of an NSO territory that has a history of nesting or a resident pair, and preferable habitat conditions in at least 40% of the core area and 30% of the home range; or 3. Within an NSO core area that does not meet these criteria, but has been selected for additional protection in collaboration with the US Fish and Wildlife Service. “Preferable” in this context refers to areas identified in RHS mapping as “selected for” or highly selected for” by NSO. NSO territory  Determination  Rationale for determination  or the territory as a whole.  TRI0138  MANLAA  No LAA determination criteria met. 18 acres NRF+PFF1 treated in territory, none in core.  TRI0162  MANLAA  No LAA determination criteria met. 23 acres NRF+PFF1 treated in territory, none in core.  TRI0258  LAA  No LAA determination criteria met, but the 5% threshold for further analysis is met. 30 acres NRF treated in territory, 29 in core. (No PFF1 treated). 5.8% of the core is NRF in potential treatment areas. These treatments are likely to adversely affect NSO for the following reasons: 9.6% of the NRF habitat in the core area is subject to treatment. The bulk of the NRF in the core proposed for treatment is a proposed fuelbreak close to the activity center. None of the NRF in the core is subject to RPM’s restricting salvage or requiring a higher level of CWD retention. As a result, project effects to nesting/roosting habitat may have an effect on NSO that is not insignificant or discountable.  TRI0281  LAA  LAA determination criterion #3 met (39 acres NRF in core is in an LOP exemption area). The 5% threshold for further analysis is also met. 145 acres NRF+PFF1 treated in territory, 81 in core. (8 acres PFF1 treated in territory, none in core).16.1% of the core is NRF or PFF1 in potential treatment areas. These treatments are likely to adversely affect NSO for the following reason: Less than two percent of the NRF potentially treated in the core is subject to RPM’s restricting salvage or requiring a higher level of CWD retention. As a result, project effects to nesting/roosting habitat may have an effect on NSO that is not insignificant or discountable.  TRI0283  LAA  No LAA determination criteria met, but the “over 5%” threshold for further analysis is met. 102 acres NRF treated in territory, 29 in core. (No PFF1 treated). 5.8% of the core is NRF in potential treatment areas. These treatments are likely to adversely affect NSO for the following reasons: 10.8% of the nesting/roosting habitat in the core area is subject to treatment. Proposed treatments are not distant from the activity center. The AC and adjacent suitable habitats are proposed for fuels reduction treatments. None of the NRF in the core is subject to RPM’s restricting salvage or requiring a higher level of CWD retention. As a result, project effects to nesting/roosting habitat may have an effect on NSO that is not insignificant or discountable.  TRI0364  MANLAA  No LAA determination criteria met. 34 acres NRF+PFF1 treated in territory, 4 in core.  TRI0381  MANLAA  No LAA determination criteria met. 32 acres NRF+PFF1 treated in territory, none in core.  TRI0438  MANLAA  No LAA determination criteria met, but the 5% threshold for further analysis is met. 172 acres NRF+PFF1 treated in territory, 41 in core. (24 acres PFF1 treated in territory, none in core).  NSO territory  Determination  Rationale for determination  8.1% of the core is NRF in potential treatment areas. 5.1% of the overall territory is NRF or PFF1 in potential treatment areas. These treatments are not likely to adversely affect NSO for the following reasons: 76.0% of NRF in potential treatment areas in the core will be subject to enhanced RPM’s that prohibit salvage entirely and require 15 tons CWD/acre, including all of the nesting/roosting habitat around the nest grove. In the territory as a whole, only 5.1% is NRF or PFF1 potentially subject to treatments. 38.4% of this area will be subject to enhanced RPM’s that restrict salvage and/or require a higher level of CWD retention. Treatments will not downgrade or remove any NRF habitats.  TRI0439  MANLAA  No LAA determination criteria met, but the 5% threshold for further analysis is met. 152 acres NRF+PFF1 treated in territory, 44 in core. (29 acres PFF1 treated in territory, 14 in core). 8.8% of the core is NRF or PFF1 in potential treatment areas. All of these areas will have RPM’s requiring 10 tons CWD/acre. Enhanced RPM’s limiting salvage or requiring 15 tons CWD/acre will not apply to any of these areas. These treatments are not likely to adversely affect NSO for the following reasons: Although none of the NRF or PFF1 in the core will have enhanced protection due to the RPM’s, none of this habitat is near the NSO activity center. The nearest PFF1 subject to treatment is approximately 0.18 mi. away, and the nearest NRF is approximately 0.24 mi. away. In the territory as a whole, only 4.5% is NRF or PFF1 potentially subject to treatments. 40.1% of this area will be subject to enhanced RPM’s that decrease potential effects to habitat suitability, and salvage is prohibited entirely in 23.0% of this area.

(No PFF1 treated). 9.9% of the core is NRF or PFF1 in potential treatment areas. These treatments are not likely to adversely affect NSO for the following reasons: • None of the NRF habitat proposed for treatment in the core is near the NSO activity center. The closest is approximately 0.33 mi. away. Only 3.6% of the nesting/roosting habitat in the core is subject to treatment. In the territory as a whole, only 2.8% is NRF or PFF1 potentially subject to treatments. Only 4.2% of the nesting/roosting habitat in the territory as a whole is subject to treatments.  NSO territory  Determination  Rationale for determination  Treatments will not downgrade or remove any NRF habitats in the core or the territory as a whole.  TRI0480  MANLAA  No LAA determination criteria met, but the 5% threshold for further analysis is met. 85 acres NRF+PFF1 treated in territory, 35 in core. (No PFF1 treated). 6.9% of the core is foraging habitat in potential treatment areas. None of this area will have RPM’s prohibiting salvage or requiring 15 tons CWD/acre. It will all have RPM’s requiring 10 tons CWD/acre. These treatments are not likely to adversely affect NSO for the following reasons: • No nesting/roosting habitat will be treated in the core. • Proposed treatments are not near the activity center. The closest treatments are approximately 0.19 miles to the southeast of the creek bottom location of the AC. Treatments will not downgrade or remove any NSO habitats in the core or the territory as a whole.  Alternative 3 The potential effects to NSO under this alternative are similar to those analyzed under Alternative 1. Removal of dying hazard trees in addition to dead trees will increase effects to NSO habitat suitability compared to Alternative 1, but the overall post-implementation habitat functionality is likely to be the same (i.e. NRF habitats will be degraded by the proposed treatments, and PFF1 habitats will be removed). All NSO determinations are the same under Alternative 3 as Alternative 1, but the number of acres impacted would be more under this alternative due to the treatments actually occurring in the entire buffer. The impacts are not overestimated for Alternative 3 as they are for Alternative 1. Alternative 4 -Northern Spotted Owl Alternative This alternative is similar to Alternative 1, but treatments will be restricted inside suitable NSO habitats. Treatments in these habitats will be limited to hazard tree mitigation, targeting dead trees only. No tree removal or fuels reduction will occur. Salvage treatments are allowed on 1,831 fewer acres than under Alternative 1, so the extent of tree removal will be more limited. Fuels treatments are allowed on 4,404 fewer acres than under Alternative 1, so more CWD will be retained in the project area60. This alternative is likely to adversely affect the same NSO territories as Alternative 1, but effects under this alternative are primarily effects of hazard tree abatement. This treatment will affect both NRF and PFF1 habitats by effectively converting snags into logs, which will reduce the number of potential perch trees for NSO and modify the availability of CWD for NSO prey species. As with Alternative 1, this alternative will degrade but not downgrade NRF habitats, and will remove PFF1 habitats. Although the same NSO activity centers that are adversely affected under Alternative 1 will be adversely affected under Alternative 4, the potential effects to NSO overall will be more limited in magnitude than the effects of Alternative 1. Alternative 5 This alternative is similar to Alternative 4, but treatments will be even more restricted (Attachment 3). The areas where restrictions will apply include all suitable NSO habitats, plus riparian reserves, inventoried roadless areas, and at-risk watersheds. Treatments in these habitats will be limited to hazard tree mitigation, targeting dead trees only, and no tree removal or fuels reduction will occur. Outside of these areas, treatments proposed are the same as Alternative 1, with the exception that no commercial timber sale removal will be allowed in any treatment areas. 60 These acreage figures apply to the entire 600-foot wide analysis area; only about half of that would actually be treated under this alternative. As with Alternative 4, this alternative is also likely to adversely affect the same NSO territories as Alternative 1 due primarily to the effects of hazard tree abatement. This treatment will affect both NRF and PFF1 habitats by effectively converting snags into logs, which will reduce the number of potential perch trees for NSO and modify the availability of CWD for NSO prey species. As with Alternative 1, this will degrade but not downgrade NRF habitats, and will remove PFF1 habitats. Although the same NSO territories that are adversely affected under Alternative 1 will be adversely affected under alternative 5, the potential effects to NSO overall will be more limited than the effects of Alternatives 1 or 4. Alternative 6 – No Action Alternative This alternative would authorize no federal actions and have no direct or indirect effects on NSO’s. Under this alternative, no vegetation will be treated. Trees and vegetation impacted by the wildfires will continue to decay and fall without human influence. No reduction in fuel loading levels or fire hazard will be achieved. Long-term effects of this alternative on NSO include continued limitations on use of the existing road system for wildfire suppression due to safety concerns, and a higher risk of widespread loss of suitable NSO habitats to high-severity wildfire. Cumulative Effects to NSO Under the Endangered Species Act, cumulative effects “are those effects of future State, tribal, or private activities, not involving Federal activities, that are reasonably certain to occur within the action area of the Federal action subject to consultation” [50 CFR §402.02]. Analysis of cumulative effects under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) addresses the impact on the environment that results from the incremental impact of the proposed action when added to other past, present and reasonable foreseeable future actions, regardless of which agency (federal or non-federal) or person undertakes these actions (40 CFR 1508.7). ESA cumulative effects of the proposed action (Alternative 1) are described in detail in the project wildlife Biological Assesment. This analysis differs from the analysis in the project wildlife Biological Assesment in that it addresses all project alternatives, and includes the effects of other foreseeable federal actions. As with the Biological Assesment, this cumulative effects analysis is bounded in space and time to properly evaluate whether there will be an overlap of effects caused by this project in combination with effects of other past, present, or future foreseeable actions. Relative to the NSO, the cumulative effects analysis area includes any area within 1.3 miles of a treatment area (the radius of a typical NSO territory). A time frame of 35 years is used for this cumulative effects analysis to reflect the NSO life span and the potential for effects to NSO that may currently inhabit the project area. The effects of past actions are reflected in the description of currently existing conditions in the wildlife Biological Assessment. Alternative 1 -Proposed Action ESA cumulative effects of the proposed action (Alternative 1) are described in detail in the project wildlife Biological Assessment. NSO territories with foreseeable federal actions with the potential to change the determination are assessed in Table 3-29. Compared with the ESA cumulative effects analysis, NEPA cumulative effects analysis results in one additional territory with a LAA determination (TRI0098). The following foreseeable federal actions are not expected to have any effects on NSO that would result in determinations that differ from those in the project wildlife Biological Assessment: 1. Grazing -This activity will have affect grasses and forbs, but is expected to have no effect on habitat suitability for NSO. 2. Plantation thinning -The plantations to be thinned are young regenerating stands that are not suitable habitat for NSO. The NSO determination for the Middle Hayfork Pre-commercial Thinning project was “no effect.” The Westside Plantation Thin project has a MANLAA determination for NSO due not to habitat modifications, but to potential noise disturbance after July 10. All NSO activity centers within the TPFHR&S action area have a MANLAA or LAA determination. The plantation thinning projects addressed here will not affect any suitable NSO habitats, and will not change the determinations for any NSO territories. 3. Log deck removal – This activity will remove logs that have already been cut and stacked along roadsides (during fire suppression efforts). These activities will have no effect on any suitable habitats, and will not cause loud and continuous noise disturbance that would result in a MANLAA or LAA determination. The ESA determination for these activities is “no effect,” and they will therefore not contribute to cumulative effects to NSO. 4. Transmission line maintenance – These activities include removal of vegetation encroaching on established transmission line corridors. These corridors are not suitable habitats for NSO, and LOP’s prevent loud and continuous noise disturbance that would result in a LAA determination. All NSO activity centers within the action area for the proposed project have a MANLAA or LAA determination, and transmission line maintenance activities on federal lands will not change the determinations for any of these territories. 5. PG&E Hazard Tree Salvage – This project consists of removal of hazard trees felled along PG&E transmission lines within the area burned in the 2015 wildfires. Based on input from YFWO, the expected ESA determination for these activities is “no effect.” These activities are therefore not expected to contribute to cumulative effects to NSO. 6. Mud Springs Fuelbreak – This project has a MANLAA determination for NSO. It is not within any NSO activity centers affected by the proposed project, and will therefore not change the determinations for any NSO territories in the TPFHR&S action area. Projects that may contribute to cumulative effects and potentially change determinations for individual NSO territories are listed below and displayed on the Project NSO Habitat Map. Potential foreseeable effects of these actions on these particular territories are addressed in Table 3-29. 1. Private lands harvest – Estimated extent of timber harvest on private lands in the analysis area. 2. Burnt Ranch – Vegetation management focusing on reducing fuels buildup and fire hazard around Burnt Ranch, CA. 3. Gemmill Thin – Vegetation management focusing on fuels reduction and accelerating development of late-successional forest habitats near Wildwood, CA. 4. Roads and Plantations Pilot project – Vegetation management focusing on roadside fuels reduction and shaded fuelbreak creation between Hayfork and Hyampom, CA. 5. Trinity Alps prescribed Burn project – Prescribed burning in the Trinity Alps Wilderness Area. 6. Sims projects – Fuels reduction and thinning in riparian corridors in the 2004 Sims Fire area. Thinning is limited to small trees (<8” DBH) and is expected to have very minor effects on NSO habitat suitability. Table 3-29. NEPA cumulative effects to NSO -Alternative 1. NSO territory  Determination  Rationale for cumulative effects determination  GRAPE  MANLAA  In this territory, very limited treatments are included in the proposed project or potentially occurring on private lands (see Biological Assessment 148 additional acres of NRF (no PFF1) may be treated in other foreseeable federal projects, including 71 acres in the core. These activities (Sims projects) may cause short-term negative effects to NSO habitat suitability, but these effects are expected to be very minor and will not downgrade habitat suitability. As a result, they will not result in cumulative effects to this territory that would change the determination for NSO.  HUM0267  MANLAA  In this territory, very limited treatments are included in the proposed project or potentially occurring on private lands (see Biological Assessment). 149 additional acres of NRF (no PFF1) may be treated in other foreseeable federal projects, including 74 acres in the core. These activities (Sims projects) may cause short-term negative effects to NSO habitat suitability, but these effects are expected to be very minor and will not downgrade habitat suitability. As a result, they will not result in cumulative effects to this territory that would change the determination for NSO.  HUM0275  MANLAA  In this territory, very limited treatments are included in the proposed project or potentially occurring on private lands (see Biological Assessment). 13 additional acres of NRF (no PFF1) may be treated in other foreseeable federal projects (none in the core). These activities (Sims projects) may cause short-term negative effects to NSO habitat suitability, but these effects are expected to be very minor and will not downgrade habitat suitability. They are also very limited in scale. As a result, they will not result in cumulative effects to this territory that would change the determination for NSO.  LAKME  LAA  In this territory, very limited treatments are included in the proposed project or potentially occurring on private lands (see Biological Assessment). 131 acres of NRF and 1 acre of PFF1 may be treated in other foreseeable federal projects (21 in the core). These activities (Sims projects) may cause short-term negative effects to NSO habitat suitability, but these effects are expected to be very minor and will not downgrade habitat suitability. They are also very limited in scale. As a result, they will not result in cumulative effects to this territory that would change the determination for NSO. This territory has a LAA determination for noise disturbance due to the proposed STNF post-fire project within an LOP exemption area.  SRF# 362  LAA  In this territory, very limited treatments are included in the proposed project or potentially occurring on private lands (see Biological Assessment). 33 acres of NRF and <1 acre of PFF1 may be treated in other foreseeable federal projects (none in the core). These activities (Sims projects) may cause short-term negative effects to NSO habitat suitability, but these effects are expected to be very minor and will not downgrade habitat suitability. They are also very limited in scale. As a result, they will not result in cumulative effects to this territory that would change the determination for NSO. This territory has a LAA determination for noise disturbance due to the proposed STNF post-fire project within an LOP exemption area.  TRI0094  MANLAA  In this territory, limited treatments are included in the proposed project or potentially occurring on private lands (see Biological Assessment). The  NSO territory  Determination  Rationale for cumulative effects determination  determination for these treatments is MANLAA. 22 acres of NRF and 6 acres of PFF1 may be treated in other foreseeable federal projects (4 acres NRF and 0 acres PFF1 in the core). These activities (Gemmill Thin project) may cause short-term negative effects to NSO habitat suitability, but will downgrade only 1 acre of suitable foraging habitat and no nesting/roosting habitat. These activities are very limited in scale in this NSO territory, and the proposed TPFHR&S project includes extensive RPM’s that will greatly limit the potential for negative effects to suitable NSO habitats. As a result, the cumulative effects of the proposed project and other future foreseeable activities (including Gemmill Thin) will not result in cumulative effects to this territory that would change the determination for NSO.  TRI0098  LAA  In this territory, limited treatments are included in the proposed project or potentially occurring on private lands (see Biological Assessment). The determination for these treatments is MANLAA. 408 acres of NRF and 9 acres of PFF1 may be treated in other foreseeable federal actions (76 acres NRF and no PFF1 in the core). These activities (Gemmill Thin project) may cause short-term negative effects to NSO habitat suitability, including downgrading 14 acres of suitable NRF habitat (9 in the core). The proposed project includes RPM’s that will decrease potential negative effects to suitable NSO habitats. However, treatments are likely to adversely affect NSO for the following reasons: • 18.1% of the core area is NRF or PFF1 subject to treatment. • 17.2% of the territory is NRF or PFF1 subject to treatment. • Proposed treatments are not distant from the activity center. Nesting/roosting habitat near the AC is proposed for fuels reduction treatments in the Gemmill Thin project. As a result, the cumulative effects of the proposed TPFHR&S project and other future foreseeable actions (including Gemmill Thin) may result in cumulative effects to this NSO territory that are not insignificant or discountable.  TRI0118  MANLAA  The proposed project will treat no NRF or PFF1 habitats in this NSO territory. As a result, although the Burnt Ranch project (USFS) will affect suitable NSO habitat in this territory, the proposed project will not contribute to cumulative effects for this NSO territory.  TRI0140  MANLAA  The proposed project will treat no NRF or PFF1 habitats in this NSO territory. As a result, although the Burnt Ranch project (USFS) will affect suitable NSO habitat in this territory, the proposed project will not contribute to cumulative effects for this NSO territory.  TRI0142  MANLAA  In this territory, very limited treatments are included in the proposed project or potentially occurring on private lands (see Biological Assessment). 35 additional acres of NRF and 1 acre PFF1 may be treated in other foreseeable federal projects (5 acres NRF and 1 acre PFF1 in core). These activities (Sims projects) may cause short-term negative effects to NSO habitat suitability, but these effects are expected to be very minor and will not downgrade habitat suitability. As a result, they will not result in cumulative effects to this territory that would change the determination for NSO. In addition, nesting has not been observed since 1991 despite ongoing and up-to-date protocol surveys. As a result, it is highly unlikely that project activities will affect NSO nesting success in this territory.  NSO territory  Determination  Rationale for cumulative effects determination  TRI0171  MANLAA  In this territory, very limited treatments are included in the proposed project or potentially occurring on private lands (see Biological Assessment), and the determination is MANLAA. The Burnt Ranch project (USFS) will affect 99 acres NRF in this territory (no PFF1), and some of these treatments may downgrade or remove suitable NSO habitats. However, all Burnt Ranch treatment areas in this territory are outside the core, and primarily near the territory’s outer edge. As a result, the cumulative effects of all foreseeable activities, including Burnt Ranch, is not expected to change the MANLAA determination for NSO.  TRI0220  MANLAA  The proposed project will treat no NRF or PFF1 habitats in this NSO territory. As a result, although the Trinity Alps Wilderness Prescribed Fire project (USFS) may cause short-term negative effects to NSO habitat suitability on 99 acres in this NSO territory, the proposed project will not contribute to cumulative effects to NSO in this territory.  TRI0252  MANLAA  In this territory, very limited treatments are included in the proposed project or potentially occurring on private lands (see Biological Assessment). 7 additional acres of NRF (no PFF1) may be treated in other foreseeable federal projects (none in the core). These activities (Sims projects) may cause short-term negative effects to NSO habitat suitability, but these effects are expected to be very minor and will not downgrade habitat suitability. As a result, they will not result in cumulative effects to this territory that would change the determination for NSO.  TRI0278  MANLAA  In this territory, very limited treatments are included in the proposed project or potentially occurring on private lands (see Biological Assessment), and the determination is MANLAA. The Burnt Ranch project (USFS) will potentially affect 142 acres NRF in this territory (no PFF1 and no treatments in the core). Some of these treatments may downgrade or remove suitable NSO habitats. However, all Burnt Ranch treatment areas in this territory are outside the core, and primarily near the territory’s outer edge. As a result, the cumulative effects of all foreseeable activities, including Burnt Ranch, are not expected to result in cumulative effects to this territory that would change the MANLAA determination for NSO. If this NSO pair moved in response to fire effects, the most likely area they would choose has no post-fire treatments proposed (see Biological Assessment). The proposed project would therefore not contribute to cumulative effects to NSO in this alternate territory location.  TRI0283  LAA  The proposed action is likely to adversely affect NSO in this territory. Potential treatments on private lands are highly unlikely to increase overall effects to NSO in this territory in a meaningfully measurable way (see Biological Assessment). The Burnt Ranch project (USFS) will potentially affect 249 acres of NRF in this territory (no PFF1), including 25 acres NRF in the core. Some of these treatments may downgrade or remove suitable NSO habitats. Although the effects of the Burnt Ranch project will not change the NSO determination, they will add to the cumulative effects for this NSO territory.  TRI0320  MANLAA  The determination for the proposed treatments along with actions on private lands is MANLAA (see Biological Assessment). 12 acres of NRF and 2 acres of PFF1 may be treated in this territory in other foreseeable federal projects (none in the core). These activities (Gemmill Thin project) may cause short-term negative effects to NSO  NSO territory  Determination  Rationale for cumulative effects determination  habitat suitability, but are very limited in scale in this NSO territory. The proposed TPFHR&S project includes extensive RPM’s that will greatly limit the potential for negative effects to suitable NSO habitats. As a result, the cumulative effects of the proposed action and other future foreseeable activities (including Gemmill Thin) will not result in cumulative effects to this territory that would change the determination for NSO.  TRI0324  MANLAA  The proposed post-fire project and foreseeable actions on private lands consist of very limited treatments, all outside the core area. The NSO determination is MANLAA (see Biological Assessment). Other foreseeable federal projects may treat 22 acres of NRF and no PFF1 in this territory in (none in the core). These activities (Roads and Plantations Pilot project) may cause short-term negative effects to NSO habitat suitability, but they are very limited in scale in this NSO territory. The expected NSO determination for the Roads and Plantations Pilot project is MANLAA. Because of its limited scope and scale, and lack of treatments in the core area, the effects of that project will not result in cumulative effects to this territory that would change the determination for NSO.  TRI0343  MANLAA  In this territory, limited treatments are included in the proposed project or potentially occurring on private lands (see Biological Assessment). The NSO determination for these actions is MANLAA. 137 additional acres of NRF and 1 acre of PFF1 may be treated in other foreseeable federal projects, including 1< acre in the core. These activities (Sims projects) may cause short-term negative effects to NSO habitat suitability, but these effects are expected to be very minor and will not downgrade habitat suitability. As a result of this and the extremely limited extent of treatments in the core area, the Sims projects will not result in cumulative effects to this territory that would change the determination for NSO.  TRI0390  LAA  The cumulative effects of the proposed action and activities on private lands would reduce total NFR+PFF in the territory below the 40%, and thus cause a LAA determination under criterion #1 (see Biological Assessment). The Burnt Ranch project (USFS) will affect 556 acres NRF in this territory (no PFF1), including 125 acres in the core. Some of these treatments may downgrade or remove suitable NSO habitats. As a result, although this project will not change the determination for NSO, it will add substantially to the cumulative effects to NSO in this territory.  Alternative 2 As stated above, the actual effects of Alternative 2 on NSO in the non-fuelbreak areas will be similar to those of Alternative 1. The same types of treatments will occur, and approximately the same number of acres will be affected. Removal of dying hazard trees in addition to dead trees will increase effects to NSO habitat suitability compared to Alternative 1, but the overall post-implementation habitat functionality is likely to be the same (i.e. NRF habitats will be degraded by the proposed treatments, and PFF1 habitats will be removed). NEPA cumulative effects to NSO in the non-fuelbreak areas will also be similar to those of Alternative 1. NSO territories with foreseeable federal actions with the potential to change the determination are assessed in Table 3-30. Proposed fuelbreaks are wider than other potential treatments (600 feet), and may have greater effects to NSO. However, there are no NSO territories that include both proposed fuelbreaks and future foreseeable federal actions other than the proposed TPFHR&S project. Therefore, no additional analysis is necessary to address potential NEPA cumulative effects from this alternative resulting from fuelbreak treatments. Table 3-30. NEPA cumulative effects to NSO -Alternative 2. NSO territory  Determination  Rationale for cumulative effects determination  TRI0098  LAA  In this territory, limited treatments are included in the proposed project or potentially occurring on private lands (see Biological Assessment). The determination for these treatments is MANLAA.408 acres of NRF and 9 acres of PFF1 may be treated in other foreseeable federal actions (76 acres NRF and no PFF1 in the core). These activities (Gemmill Thin project) may cause short-term negative effects to NSO habitat suitability, including downgrading 14 acres of suitable NRF habitat (9 in the core). Proposed treatments under Alternative 2 would affect 6 acres NRF in the core (2 acres PFF1) and 61 acres NRF in the territory (33 acres PFF1). The proposed project includes RPM’s that will decrease potential negative effects to suitable NSO habitats. However, treatments are likely to adversely affect NSO for the following reasons: • 16.9% of the core area is NRF or PFF1 subject to treatment. • 14.8% of the territory is NRF or PFF1 subject to treatment. • Proposed treatments are not distant from the activity center. Nesting/roosting habitat near the AC is proposed for fuels reduction treatments in the Gemmill Thin project. As a result, the cumulative effects of the proposed TPFHR&S project under Alternative 2, and other future foreseeable actions (including Gemmill Thin), may result in cumulative effects to this NSO territory that are not insignificant or discountable. The more limited effect of the TPFHR&S project under Alternative 2 (as compared to Alternative 1) slightly decreases potential cumulative effects, but does not change the determination.  TRI0283  LAA  The proposed action under Alternative 1 is likely to adversely affect NSO in this territory (see Biological Assessment). Proposed treatments under Alternative 2 would affect 29 acres NRF in the core (no PFF1) and 102 acres NRF in the territory (no PFF1). Under Alternative 2, a smaller percentage of the core (5.8%) is NRF in potential treatment areas. However, none of this area will have RPM’s preventing salvage or requiring 15 tons CWD/acre. RPM’s requiring 10 tons CWD/acre, and no restrictions on salvage, will apply instead. Treatments also include the activity center itself. As a result, the proposed action under Alternative 2 may affect NSO to a degree that is not insignificant or discountable. Potential treatments on private lands are highly unlikely to increase overall effects to NSO in this territory in a meaningfully measurable way (see Biological Assessment). The Burnt Ranch project (USFS) will potentially affect 249 acres of NRF in this territory (no PFF1), including 25 acres NRF in the core. Some of these treatments may downgrade or remove suitable NSO habitats. Although the effects of the Burnt Ranch project will not change the NSO determination, they will add to the cumulative effects for this NSO territory under Alternative 2, as they would under Alternative 1.  TRI0390  LAA  The cumulative effects of the proposed action and activities on private lands would reduce total NFR+PFF in the territory below the 40%, and thus cause a LAA determination under criterion #1 (see Biological Assessment). This effect is due to actions on private lands. No removal of NRF+PFF1 habitats would occur under Alternatives 1 or 2. The Burnt Ranch project (USFS) will affect 556 acres NRF in this territory (no PFF1), including 125 acres in the core. Some of these treatments may downgrade or remove suitable NSO habitats. As a result, although this  NSO territory  Determination  Rationale for cumulative effects determination  project will not change the determination for NSO, it will add substantially to the cumulative effects to NSO in this territory, under both Alternatives 1 and 2.  Alternative 3 -Wider Buffer Alternative This alternative allows treatment of the entire 600-foot total width buffer that is analyzed under Alternative 1. As a result, the potential NEPA cumulative effects to NSO under this alternative are similar to those analyzed under Alternative 1. Removal of dying hazard trees in addition to dead trees will increase effects to NSO habitat suitability compared to Alternative 1, but the overall post-implementation habitat functionality is likely to be the same (i.e. NRF habitats will be degraded by the proposed treatments, and PFF1 habitats will be removed); therefore, cumulative effects are similar to the Alternative 1 analysis, but somewhat more intensive due to removal of dying hazard trees in addition to dead hazard trees. Alternative 4 -Northern Spotted Owl Alternative This alternative is similar to Alternative 1, but treatments will be restricted inside suitable NSO habitats. Treatments in these habitats will be limited to hazard tree mitigation, targeting dead trees only; no tree removal or fuels reduction will occur. Salvage treatments are allowed on 1,831 fewer acres than under Alternative 1, so the extent of tree removal will be more limited. Fuels treatments are allowed on 4,404 fewer acres than under Alternative 1, so more CWD will be retained in the project area61. This alternative is likely to adversely affect the same habitats as Alternative 1 due primarily to the effects of hazard tree abatement. This treatment will affect both NRF and PFF1 habitats by effectively converting snags into logs, which will reduce the number of potential perch trees for NSO and modify the availability of CWD for NSO prey species. As with Alternative 1, this alternative will degrade but not downgrade NRF habitats, and will remove PFF1 habitats. Although the same NSO habitats will be adversely affected, the potential NEPA cumulative effects to NSO overall will be more limited in magnitude than the effects of Alternative 1. Alternative 5 -Minimum Impact Alternative This alternative is similar to Alternative 4, but treatments will be even more restricted. The areas where restrictions will apply include all suitable NSO habitats, plus riparian reserves, inventoried roadless areas, and at-risk watersheds. Treatments in these habitats will be limited to hazard tree mitigation, targeting dead trees only, and no tree removal or fuels reduction will occur. Outside of these areas, treatments proposed are the same as Alternative 4, with the exception that no commercial timber sale removal will be allowed in any treatment areas. As with Alternative 4, this alternative is also likely to adversely affect the same habitats as Alternative 1 due primarily to the effects of hazard tree abatement. This treatment will affect both NRF and PFF1 habitats by effectively converting snags into logs, which will reduce the number of potential perch trees for NSO and modify the availability of CWD for NSO prey species. As with Alternative 1, this will degrade but not downgrade NRF habitats, and will remove PFF1 habitats. Although the same NSO habitats will be adversely affected as with Alternative 1, the potential cumulative effects to NSO overall will be more limited than the effects of Alternatives 1 or 4. 61 These acreage figures apply to the entire 600-foot wide analysis area. Alternative 6 – No Action Alternative This alternative would authorize no federal actions and have no direct or indirect effects on NSO’s. Under this alternative, no vegetation will be treated, and no reduction in fuel loading levels or fire hazard will be achieved. As a result, this alternative would not contribute to short-term cumulative effects to NSO habitats. Long-term effects of this alternative include continued limitations on use of the existing road system for wildfire suppression. This alternative will therefore likely contribute to long-term cumulative effects to NSO by increasing the risk of widespread loss of suitable NSO habitats to high-severity wildfire. The other foreseeable activities on federal and non-federal lands in the analysis area may ameliorate this effect by reducing available fuels. Effects to NSO Critical Habitat The project wildlife Biological Assessment includes a detailed description of the physical and biological features (PBF’s) of NSO Critical Habitat, and the effects of the proposed action (Alternative 1) on NSO Critical Habitat. This document summarizes the effects of Alternative 1, and analyzes the potential effects of Alternatives 2-6 on NSO Critical Habitat. For the NSO, the PBF’s essential to the conservation of the species are forested areas that are used or likely to be used for nesting, roosting, foraging, or dispersing. PBFs provide one or more of the following life-history requirements: • Space for individual and population growth and for normal behavior; • Food, water, air, light, minerals, or other nutritional or physiological requirements; • Cover or shelter; • Sites for breeding, reproduction, or rearing (or development) of offspring; and • Habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of the historical, geographical, and ecological distributions of a species. Alternative 1 -Proposed Action Briefly, the proposed action is likely to adversely affect NSO Critical Habitat for the following reasons: 1. Although project RPM’s will limit effects to snags (potential NSO foraging perches and/or shelter for prey species), particularly to snags existing before the 2015 wildfires, snag density in suitable habitats within NSO Critical Habitat will be reduced in treatment areas to an extent that may not be insignificant or discountable. Although project RPM’s will limit reduction of CWD in treatment areas, CWD levels in suitable habitats within NSO Critical Habitat may be reduced to an extent that may not be insignificant or discountable. However, the effect on the PBFs of NSO Critical Habitat will be limited for the following reasons: 1. Treatments will degrade but not downgrade or remove any vegetation types designated by the 2012 final Critical Habitat rule as NSO nesting/roosting, foraging or dispersal habitats. 2. Project RPM’s will decrease the potential effects of treatments in areas of high value to NSO’s, especially in nesting/roosting and foraging habitats. 3. The 2012 Critical Habitat ruling does not include PFF1 areas. Potential effects to NSO’s resulting from treatments in these areas will be greatly limited by the narrow width of treatments and the proximity of all PFF1 treatment acres to untreated areas. Alternative 2 Like Alternative 1, Alternative 2 is likely to adversely affect NSO Critical Habitat. The effects of Alternative 2 on NSO Critical Habitat in the non-fuelbreak areas will be similar to those of Alternative 1. The same types of treatments will occur, and approximately the same number of acres will actually be affected. Removal of dying hazard trees in addition to dead trees will increase effects to NSO Critical Habitat PBFs compared to Alternative 1, but the overall post-implementation habitat functionality is likely to be the same (i.e. NRF and dispersal habitats will be degraded but not downgraded by the proposed treatments). This alternative includes 2,178 acres of fuelbreak treatments, along approximately 16 miles of roads. As a result, CWD in the form of logs and snags will be reduced on a larger number of acres than under Alternative 1. However, the project resource protection measures detailed under Alternative 1, including the CWD retention measures, will also apply to the fuelbreak treatment areas. These measures will ensure retention of large amounts of CWD, an important habitat element for NSO prey species. The restriction of live tree removal to trees 10” DBH or less in the fuelbreak areas will limit the potential reduction in canopy cover, especially in the late-successional forests that are most suitable for this species. The canopy in these stands is dominated by large-diameter trees, and removal of small-diameter trees will have a minimal effect on overall canopy cover levels. These measures will limit the extent of effects to NSO Critical Habitat. Pruning lower branches of live trees is expected to have little or no effect on canopy cover or any other habitat element important to the PBF’s of NSO Critical Habitat. Alternative 3 This alternative allows treatment of the entire 600-foot total width buffer that is analyzed under Alternative 1. As a result, the potential effects to NSO Critical Habitat under this alternative are similar to those analyzed under Alternative 1. Removal of dying hazard trees in addition to dead trees will increase effects to NSO Critical Habitat PBFs compared to Alternative 1, but the overall post-implementation habitat functionality is likely to be the same (i.e. NRF habitats will be degraded by the proposed treatments, and PFF1 habitats will be removed). Alternative 4 The effects of this alternative on NSO Critical Habitat are likely to be similar to the effects of Alternative 1 due primarily to the effects of hazard tree abatement, and this alternative is likely to adversely affect NSO Critical Habitat. Hazard tree abatement will affect NRF and dispersal habitats by effectively converting snags into logs, which will reduce the number of potential perch trees for NSO and modify the availability of CWD for NSO prey species. As with Alternative 1, this alternative will degrade but not downgrade NRF or dispersal habitats. The potential effects to NSO Critical Habitat PBFs overall will be more limited in magnitude than the effects of Alternative 1. Alternative 5 As with Alternative 4, the effects of this alternative on NSO Critical Habitat are likely to be similar to the effects of Alternative 1 due primarily to the effects of hazard tree abatement, and this alternative is likely to adversely affect NSO Critical Habitat. This treatment will affect both NRF and dispersal habitats by effectively converting snags into logs, which will reduce the number of potential perch trees for NSO and modify the availability of CWD for NSO prey species. As with Alternative 1, this will degrade but not downgrade NRF or dispersal habitats. The potential effects to NSO Critical Habitat PBFs overall will be more limited than the effects of Alternatives 1 or 4. Alternative 6 – No Action Alternative This alternative would authorize no federal actions and have no immediate effect on NSO Critical Habitat Units. Under this alternative, no vegetation will be treated. Trees and vegetation impacted by the wildfires will continue to decay and fall without human influence. No reduction in fuel loading levels or fire hazard will be achieved. Long-term effects of this alternative within NSO Critical Habitat include continued limitations on use of the existing road system for wildfire suppression due to safety concerns, and a higher risk of widespread loss of NSO habitat within Critical Habitat Units to high-severity wildfire. Sensitive Wildlife Species The Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) provides protection for sensitive wildlife species in the form of management goals to maintain or increase existing viable populations of sensitive species (Forest Plan pages 3-26, 4-5). Impacts to wildlife sensitive species are addressed in the project Biological Evaluation and summarized in Table 3-31. Table 3-31.

There is one known site that may be affected by project activities, approximately 5 miles northwest of Hyampom, CA (T4N R6E, HM). The existing management plan for this site recommends a restriction on noise disturbance within 0.75 mi of the nest site. Accordingly, an LOP will be imposed on all activities causing loud and continuous noise disturbance or smoke that will potentially disturb this species during its breeding season. This LOP will apply from January 1 through August 15 to all areas within 0.75 mi of the nest site (Figure 3-8). Surveys to protocol can be used to generate new breeding activity results. If subsequent protocol compliant surveys show no nesting activity within 0.75 miles of proposed activities at the time of implementation, LOP’s may be lifted. Northern goshawksThe Forest Plan requires protection of known northern goshawk nest sites (Forest Plan p. 3-27). There are three known sites that may be affected by project activities, approximately 5 miles northeast of Wildwood, CA (T30N R10W, MDM). An LOP will be imposed on all activities causing loud and continuous noise disturbance or smoke that will potentially disturb this species during its breeding season. This LOP will apply from February 1 through August 15 to all areas within 0.5 mi of the nest sites (Figure 3-9). Surveys to protocol can be used to generate new breeding activity results. If subsequent protocol compliant surveys show no nesting activity within 0.5 miles of proposed activities at the time of implementation, LOPs may be lifted. Peregrine falcons The Forest Plan requires protection of known peregrine falcon nest sites (Forest Plan p. 3-27). There are no known peregrine falcon nest sites that would be affected by project activities. White-headed woodpeckers, black-backed woodpeckers, pygmy nuthatches, and flammulated owls Requirements for white-headed woodpeckers, black-backed woodpeckers, pygmy nuthatches, and flammulated owls are designed “to maintain adequate numbers of large snags and green-tree replacements for future snags in appropriate forest types within the range of these four species “in sufficient numbers to maintain 100 percent of potential population levels.” “Snags over 20 inches DBH are particularly valuable for these species. Snags over 20 inches DBH may be marked for cutting only after retaining the best available snags (considering size, longevity, etc.) in sufficient numbers to meet 100 percent of potential population levels of these four species. It is recognized, however, that safety considerations may prevent always retaining all snags. Use of standardized definitions of hazard trees is required. For the longer term, provide for sufficient numbers of green trees to provide for the full (100 percent) population potential of each species.” (Forest Plan pp. 4-63/64). Specific snag levels to achieve this goal are: 0.60 conifer snags >15” DBH per acre (or largest available) in soft decay stages for white-headed woodpeckers and pygmy nuthatches, and 0.12 conifer snags per acre >17 inches DBH (or largest available) in hard decay stages for black-backed woodpeckers. These standards are also assumed to provide adequate snag and snag retention levels for flammulated owls (Forest Plan pp. 4-63/64). The project area is outside the known range of white-headed woodpeckers, black-backed woodpeckers, and pygmy nuthatches, and there are no recorded observations of these species in or near the project area. Flammulated owls do occur within the project area. Because of natural mortality and the effects of the 2015 wildfires, the density of snags in the project area is far in excess of recommended levels. Project activities will remove snags from a narrow strip of land near existing roads, and these treatments will affect a very small percentage (5-6%) of the burned area. As a result, the density of snags available to flammulated owls in the project area is expected to remain well above the recommended levels after project implementation Figure 3-8 Bald eagle limited operating period area Figure 3-9 Northern goshawk limited operating period area. Survey and Manage Wildlife Species Introduction Survey and Manage requirements were established to address little-known species that were believed to be associated with old-growth and late-successional forest micro-habitats, and for which species experts were unsure whether the Late-Successional Reserve (LSR) system was sufficient to provide for their conservation. The purpose of this report is to assess potential effects of the proposed Trinity Post-Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project in sufficient detail to determine whether it is consistent with current Survey and Manage requirements. Table 3-32 and the analysis following it address all Survey and Manage wildlife species assessed, requirements for pre-disturbance surveys and/or protecting known sites, and determinations of potential effects of project activities. Of the eleven wildlife Survey and Manage species analyzed in this report, eight are also designated as Forest Service Sensitive species. These species are addressed in this document using the criteria that apply to Survey and Manage species, and addressed in the project Wildlife Biological Evaluation using the criteria that apply to Forest Service Sensitive species. Compliance with Law, Regulations, Policy, and The Forest Plan Forest Service guidance under the Northwest Forest Plan and the Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) requires the agency to analyze projects for potential impacts to Survey and Manage Species. The Survey and Manage program is a result of the 2001 Record of Decision and Standards and Guidelines for Amendments to Survey and Manage, Protection Buffer, and other Mitigation Measure Standards and Guidelines (USDA Forest Service and USDI Bureau of Land Management 2001). The species listed in the 2001 Survey and Manage Record of Decision (ROD) were selected “to more efficiently provide the level of species protection intended in the Northwest Forest Plan...for the management of habitat for late-successional and old-growth forest related species within the range of the northern spotted owl” (p. 1). Modifications to the requirements in the ROD included a Settlement Agreement filed on July 6, 2011, in Conservation Northwest [and others] v. Sherman, Case No. C08-1067-JCC (W.D. Wash). On April 25, 2013 the 9th Circuit Court reversed the District Court's approval of the 2011 Settlement Agreement, concluding that "Because the consent decree allows for substantial, permanent amendments to Survey and Manage, it impermissibly conflicts with laws governing the process for such amendments" (Conservation Northwest [and others] v. Sherman [and others], No. 11-35729 [9th Cir.] No. 08-1067-JCC [W.D.Wash]). The 9th Circuit Court remanded the decision to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with its opinion. The District Court issued a remedy order on February 18, 2014 (Conservation Northwest v. Bonnie, W.WA No. C08-1067-JCC). As a result, the 2011 Settlement Agreement is invalid and the order issued by Judge Coughenour (Conservation Northwest [and others] v. Rey [and others] No. 08-1067) on December 17, 2009 is still valid. Consequently, the Forest Service Pacific Southwest and Pacific Northwest Regions are currently working under the 2001 Survey and Manage Record of Decision and the December 2003 species list (USDA Forest Service 2014). Proposed Actions and Alternatives AnalyzedFor a detailed description of the alternatives considered for this analysis, please see Chapter 2 of this Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). MethodologyThis analysis is based on species occurrence data documented in National Forest wildlife databases (Shasta-Trinity and Six Rivers National Forests) and the California Natural Diversity Database, maintained by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. For this analysis, potential effects were assessed based primarily on the likelihood and intensity of effects to habitat characteristics favorable for these species, such as high canopy cover levels and moist micro-habitats. The Survey and Manage program requires pre-disturbance field surveys for some species where appropriate (Table 3-32). Line officers have discretion to determine whether or not conditions warrant additional surveys. The ROD Standards & Guidelines (p. 22) stipulate that “The line officer should seek specialists’ recommendations to help determine the need for a survey based on site-specific information. In making such determination, the line officer should consider the probability of the species being present on the project site, as well as the probability that the project would cause a significant negative effect on the species habitat or the persistence of the species at the site.” Three evaluation criteria were used to determine whether a proposed project triggers the need for field surveys: 1. species range, 2. habitat suitability, and 3. the potential for project activities to degrade habitat or cause disturbance (Duncan and others 2003). Evaluation of these criteria is presented in Table 3-32 and the analysis following it. Additional surveys were determined to be unwarranted for the following reasons: 1.) Areas where intensive treatments are proposed have been heavily affected by wildfire, and habitat suitability for Survey and Manage mollusk species is very low; and 2.) Areas that are highly suitable for Survey and Manage mollusk species will have low-intensity treatments and extensive resource protection measures, and these treatments are unlikely to have a meaningfully measurable effect on habitat suitability or persistence of these species. Affected environment The analysis area covers a large portion of the South Fork and Trinity River Management Units, and vegetative communities are highly variable across this area. The most common vegetation types are typified by mixed conifers in the overstory, oaks and other hardwoods in the understory, and shrubs, forbs and grasses comprising the ground cover. Environmental ConsequencesTable 3-32 displays the management requirements for the wildlife Survey and Manage species on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The majority of these species do not occur in the project area, and thus will not be affected by proposed activities under any of the project alternatives. Table 3-32.

N  Alternative 1 – Proposed Action This alternative allows treatments of a 300-foot total width buffer (up to 275 feet on one side of the road, and a minimum of 25 feet on the other side). The width of the buffer on either side of the road could change but would not exceed 300 feet; i.e. if conditions lend to a wider treatment on the uphill side, the uphill side may be treated up to 275 feet from the road and the downhill side would be treated 25 feet from the road. The minimum treatment area along either side of the road will be 25 feet. The maximum area of treatment is approximately 8,000 acres. Because the exact location of treatment at any given point along a road is unknown, this analysis considers treatment impacts to the entire 600-foot width buffer to ensure that any suitable habitat or known locations of Survey and Manage species are addressed in this analysis. This will result in roughly twice the number of acres analyzed as will actually be treated, and as a result this analysis greatly overestimates the potential effects to Survey and Manage wildlife species. Direct and Indirect Effects Helminthoglypta talmadgei (Klamath shoulderband snail) H. talmadgei is classified as a Category D Survey and Manage species. The management objective for these species is to “Identify and manage high-priority sites to provide for a reasonable assurance of species persistence.” Pre-disturbance surveys are not required for Category D species (ROD S&G p. 11). H. talmadgei occurs in stable rock talus and rockslides in limestone substrates, especially near springs or streams. On moist, north-facing slopes they can also occur under woody debris, moss and leaf mold. This species feeds on herbaceous plants, and overhead vegetative cover appears to be an important habitat element for shading and food (Duncan and others 1999; USDI Bureau of Land Management 1999). This species is common and well-distributed across the South Fork and Trinity River Management Units, and observations have been recorded near and within proposed treatment areas. Project activities have the potential to affect H. talmadgei by directly impacting individuals during project implementation, or modifying habitat in ways that reduce its suitability for this species. However, the following factors will greatly reduce potential effects to this species: • Only dead vegetation is targeted for treatment. The sites with the most intensive treatments will therefore be those with the greatest extent of fire-induced mortality. These sites are least likely to support habitat conditions favorable to H. talmadgei and other late-successional forest species. As a result, potential effects to these species are very limited in the areas that were most heavily affected by wildfire. • Areas where fire severity was low are most likely to still support habitat conditions favorable to H. talmadgei (where conditions were favorable pre-fire). However, since proposed treatments target dead vegetation only, areas with low fire-induced mortality will have much less treatment than areas heavily affected by high-severity wildfire. Treatments in areas that survived largely intact may reduce woody debris to some extent, but post-fire levels of woody debris are much higher than pre-fire levels, and project resource protection measures limit removal of woody debris (see below). Also, removal of dead vegetation will have little effect on canopy cover. As a result, in the areas that were least affected by wildfire and are likely to be most suitable to H. talmadgei, effects to this species will be very limited. • Project resource protection measures include a prohibition on timber salvage in northern spotted owl (NSO) nesting/roosting habitat in High-Value Wildlife Conservation Areas (HVWCA’s). These late-successional forested habitats are also likely to be high-quality habitats for H. talmadgei, and this protective measure will further reduce potential effects to H. talmadgei in these valuable habitats. • Project resource protection measures include limitations on timber salvage in NSO foraging habitat in HVWCA’s. Salvage in these areas will be restricted to hazard trees only. This measure will further reduce potential effects to H. talmadgei habitat quality in habitats high in value to this species. • Project resource protection measures include requirements to leave 15 tons of coarse woody debris (CWD) per acre in suitable NSO habitats in HVWCA’s. Except where it poses a hazard to operations or haul routes, all CWD in advanced states of decay (snag and log decay classes 3-5) will be retained in these areas. This measure will benefit H. talmadgei by ensuring retention of large amounts of this important habitat feature in HVWCA’s. Outside HVWCA’s, 10 tons CWD/acre will still be retained. • Numerous project resource protection measures restrict operations in riparian habitats. These include equipment exclusion zones for all wet meadows, seeps, fens and springs. Riparian habitats are valuable to H. talmadgei, and these measures will further reduce potential effects to this species. • The project’s connected actions will occur in existing roadbeds and culvert sites. These sites have been highly disturbed, and have limited potential value to this species. Ground disturbance at sites with some potential to support this species (e.g., riparian habitats at culvert replacement sites) will be very limited in spatial extent. • Proposed treatments are specifically designed to reduce the occurrence and extent of high-severity wildfires. They will thus likely reduce the devastating impacts these wildfires have on H. talmadgei habitats and populations. • Replanting treatments will accelerate re-establishment of high-quality habitats for H. talmadgei and other wildlife Survey and Manage species where high-severity fire has occurred. As a result of these project design features and resource protection measures, project activities are unlikely to have any meaningfully measurable effect on the life requirements or habitat suitability for this species, or on its persistence in the project area. Vespericola pressleyi (Pressley [Big Bar] hesperian snail) This species occurs in conifer and/or hardwood forest habitats in permanently damp areas within 200 m. of seeps, springs, and stable streams, and uses woody debris and rock refugia near water during dry and cold periods. Recommended protection measures include conserving favorable canopy cover, woody debris and herbaceous vegetation in suitable habitats (Duncan and others 1999; USDI Bureau of Land Management 1999). This species is known primarily from the Big Bar area of the Trinity River Management Unit, but has also been found on the South Fork Management Unit. It appears to be less common than H. talmadgei, but observations have been recorded near and within the boundaries of proposed treatment units. Extensive protection measures for riparian habitats have been incorporated into the project design. These measures protect the permanently damp areas that are key landscape features for this species, and greatly decrease the potential for negative effects to habitat conditions around these features. The project’s connected actions include removal or replacement of culverts to improve overall hydrologic conditions in the watersheds affected by project activities. Ground disturbance at sites with some potential to support this species (e.g., riparian habitats at culvert replacement sites) will be very limited in spatial extent. The other resource protection measures cited above for H. talmadgei will also greatly reduce the potential for negative effects to V. pressleyi. As a result, project activities will not have any meaningfully measurable effect on the life requirements or habitat suitability for V. pressleyi, or on its persistence in the project area, and conditions do not warrant additional field surveys for this species. Alternative 2 – Consistent Buffer and Fuelbreaks Alternative This alternative is similar to Alternative 1, with three exceptions: 1. The buffer width is consistent throughout treatment areas (150 feet on either side of the road). 2. Both dead and dying hazard trees are subject to removal. 3. Approximately 16 miles of treated roads will be subject to fuelbreak treatments, which have a wider treatment zone than the other treatment types (600 feet on either side of the road). The fuelbreak treatments include removing live small-diameter trees (up to 10” DBH), and pruning live trees to remove lower branches. Helminthoglypta talmadgei (Klamath shoulderband snail) The effects of Alternative 2 on H. talmadgei in the non-fuelbreak areas will be similar to those of Alternative 1. The same types of treatments will occur, and approximately the same number of acres will actually be affected. Removal of dying hazard trees in addition to dead trees will increase the potential for minor effects to habitat suitability somewhat compared to Alternative 1 by potentially affecting canopy cover and removing some sources of future CWD. The potential effects to canopy cover are limited and short-term due to the weakened condition of the living hazard trees that will be removed under this alternative, and the likelihood that they will die in the near future regardless of the proposed treatments. The CWD retention measures incorporated into the project design will ensure retention of large amounts of CWD. Fuelbreaks: Observations of H. talmadgei have been recorded within proposed fuelbreak areas, and the potential for effects to this species may be greater within the fuelbreak areas than in the other treatment areas. Removal of small-diameter trees in fuelbreaks has a greater potential to affect canopy cover. However, the restriction of live tree removal to trees 10” DBH or less will greatly limit the potential reduction in canopy cover, especially in the late-successional forests that are most suitable for this species. The canopy in these stands is dominated by large-diameter trees, and removal of small-diameter trees has a very limited potential to affect overall canopy cover levels. Pruning lower branches of live trees is expected to have no measurable effect on canopy cover or any other habitat element important to H. talmadgei. Because this alternative includes fuelbreaks on approximately 16 miles of roads, tree removal will occur on more acres than under Alternative 1. As a result, CWD will be reduced on a larger number of acres. However, the project resource protection measures detailed under Alternative 1, including the CWD retention measures, will also apply to the fuelbreak treatment areas. These measures will ensure retention of large amounts of CWD, an important habitat element for this species. In summary, although Alternative 2 has a greater potential to affect H. talmadgei than Alternative 1, project design features and resource protection measures will provide for a reasonable assurance of species persistence in fuelbreaks as well as the non-fuelbreak areas. Overall, project activities are unlikely to have a meaningfully measurable effect on the life requirements or habitat suitability for this species, or on its persistence in the project area. Vespericola pressleyi (Pressley [Big Bar] hesperian snail) The effects of this alternative on V. pressleyi in the non-fuelbreak treatment areas will be very similar to those of alternative 1. The same types of treatments will occur, and approximately the same number of acres will be affected. Fuelbreaks: Observations of V. pressleyi have been recorded near proposed fuelbreaks. The closest observation was approximately 1 mile to the east. The extensive riparian protection measures protecting permanently damp areas will protect these habitats in fuelbreaks as well as other treatment areas. The many resource protection measures cited above for H. talmadgei will also greatly reduce the potential for negative effects to V. pressleyi, both within and outside of fuelbreaks. As a result, project activities will not have any meaningfully measurable effect on the life requirements or habitat suitability for V. pressleyi, or on its persistence in the project area under this alternative, and conditions do not warrant additional field surveys for this species. Alternative 3 – Wider Buffer Alternative This alternative allows treatment of a 600-foot total width buffer, rather than the 300-foot buffer allowed under Alternative 1. However, because the exact location of treatment at any given point along a road is unknown under Alternative 1, the analysis for that alternative assumes treatment of the entire 600-foot width within which treatments may occur. As a result, the analysis for Alternative 1 assumes effects to the same acres that will be subject to treatment under Alternative 3, and the potential effects to Survey and Manage wildlife species are very similar to those analyzed under Alternative 1. Removal of dying hazard trees in addition to dead trees will increase the potential for minor effects to habitat suitability somewhat compared to Alternative 1 by potentially affecting canopy cover and removing some sources of future CWD. The potential effects to canopy cover are limited due to the weakened condition of the living hazard trees that will be removed under this alternative, and the likelihood that they will die in the near future regardless of the proposed treatments. The CWD retention measures incorporated into the project design will ensure retention of large amounts of CWD. Alternative 4 – Northern Spotted Owl Alternative This alternative is similar to Alternative 1, but treatments will be greatly restricted inside suitable NSO habitats. Treatments in these habitats will be limited to hazard tree mitigation, targeting dead trees only; no tree removal or fuels reduction will occur. As a result, potential effects to Survey and Manage wildlife species will be similar to but more limited than those of Alternative 1. Salvage treatments will occur on fewer acres, so the extent of tree removal will be more limited than Alternative 1. Fuels treatments will also occur on fewer acres, so more CWD will be retained in the project area. In summary, overall effects will be less than Alternative 1, and project activities will not have any meaningfully measurable effect on the life requirements or habitat suitability for Survey and Manage wildlife species, or on their persistence in the project area. Alternative 5 – Minimum Impact Alternative This alternative is similar to Alternative 4, but treatments will be even more restricted. The areas where restrictions will apply include all suitable NSO habitats, plus riparian reserves, inventoried roadless areas, and at-risk watersheds. Treatments in these habitats will be limited to hazard tree mitigation, targeting dead trees only, and no tree removal or fuels reduction will occur. Outside of these areas, treatments proposed are the same as Alternative 4, with the exception that no commercial timber sale removal will be allowed in any treatment areas. Potential effects to Survey and Manage wildlife species will be similar to, but more limited than, those of Alternative 4. Fewer acres will be subject to fuels treatments, so more CWD will be retained in the project area. In summary, overall effects will be the least compared to all other action alternatives, and project activities will not have any meaningfully measurable effect on the life requirements or habitat suitability for Survey and Manage wildlife species, or on their persistence in the project area. Alternative 6 – No Action Alternative Under this alternative, no vegetation will be treated. Trees and vegetation impacted by the wildfires will continue to decay and fall without human influence. No reduction in fuel loading levels or fire hazard will be achieved. Long-term effects of this alternative on Survey and Manage wildlife species include continued limitations on use of existing road system for wildfire suppression due to safety concerns, and a higher risk of widespread loss of suitable habitats to high-severity wildfire. Cumulative Effects Analysis of cumulative effects under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) addresses the impact on the environment that results from the incremental impact of the proposed action when added to other past, present and reasonable foreseeable future actions, regardless of which agency (federal or non-federal) or person undertakes these actions (40 CFR 1508.7). The cumulative effects analysis is bound in space and time to properly evaluate if there would be any overlap of effects caused by this project with effects of other foreseeable actions. To encompass potentially affected individuals of the species analyzed in this report, this analysis is bounded in space to include any area within 375 feet of all treatment areas, and bounded in time to include the time needed for substantial re-establishment of key habitat components such as large woody debris and canopy cover.  The estimated time for this to occur, relative to the habitat needs of the species addressed in this analysis, is approximately 40 years.. These bounding parameters are based on species information on H. talmadgei and V. pressleyi in Duncan and others (1999). Reasonably foreseeable future actions are described in the project EIS. Past effects are assumed to be expressed within the current habitat conditions shown in the analysis, including the effects of the 2015 wildfires. On the Shasta-Trinity and Six Rivers National Forests, there are 660 and 35 known H. talmadgei and V. pressleyi sites, respectively. Fifty known H. talmadgei sites are within the cumulative effects analysis area for this project, and 30 are within potential treatment units. Six known V. pressleyi sites are within the cumulative effects analysis area, and 2 are within the boundaries of potential treatment units. Approximately 1.1% of the known H. talmadgei sites (7 sites total) were directly affected by moderate-or high-severity wildfire in 2015. No known V. pressleyi sites were directly affected. This analysis assumes private lands that burned at moderate or high severity may be salvage logged. Because H. talmadgei and V. pressleyi are associated with late successional conditions, and areas that burned at high and moderate severity no longer provide habitat for this species, salvage logging operations on private lands are not expected to affect H. talmadgei or V. pressleyi. Other federal actions in the analysis area include vegetation management and fuels reduction projects that will affect existing vegetation. Like the proposed project, these projects incorporate extensive resource protection measures for riparian areas and other wildlife habitats. As a result, these projects are unlikely to result in meaningfully measurable effects to V. pressleyi, or effects to the life requirements or habitat suitability for H. talmadgei that would affect its persistence in the project area in a meaningfully measurable way. In summary, neither the proposed activities (under all alternatives) nor the other future foreseeable actions are expected to have any meaningfully measurable effect on the life requirements or habitat suitability for H. talmadgei or V. pressleyi, or on their persistence in the project area, and they will not result in significant cumulative effects for either of these species. Migratory Birds Introduction Under the National Forest Management Act, the Forest Service is directed to “provide for diversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area in order to meet overall multiple-use objectives” (P.L. 94-588, Sec 6 (g) (3) (B)). The January 2000 USDA Forest Service Landbird Conservation Strategic Plan, followed by Executive Order 13186 in 2001, in addition to the Partners in Flight (PIF), specific habitat Conservation Plans for birds and the January 2004 PIF North American Landbird Conservation Plan, all reference goals and objectives for integrating bird conservation into forest management and planning. In late 2008, a Memorandum of Understanding between the USDA Forest Service and the US Fish and Wildlife Service to Promote the Conservation of Migratory Birds (MOU) was signed. The intent of the MOU is to strengthen migratory bird conservation through enhanced collaboration and cooperation between the Forest Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service as well as other federal, state, tribal and local governments. Within the National Forests, conservation of migratory birds focuses on providing a diversity of habitat conditions at multiple spatial scales and ensuring that bird conservation is addressed when planning land management activities. In early 2016, both USDA Forest Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service have agreed to extend the MOU as currently written. The proposed Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction & Salvage project implements direction contained within the Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) (USDA Forest Service 1995). Opportunities to promote conservation of migratory birds and their habitats were incorporated into the development and design of the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction & Salvage project (MOU Section C: items 1 and 11 and Section D: items 1, 3, and 4). Proposed Actions and Alternatives AnalyzedFor a detailed description of the alternatives considered for this analysis, please see Chapter 2 of the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction & Salvage Environmental Impact Statement. Affected environment Proposed treatments are spread widely across a very large area with highly variable vegetative conditions ranging from old-growth conifer forest to shrub and grasslands. Mixed conifer forests dominate this area. Overall, the area contains a variety of habitat types and conditions for migratory bird species. The majority of the Forest is in US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Bird Conservation Region 5 (BCR 5), the Northern Pacific Rainforest. The Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction & Salvage project area is in the western portion of the Forest, and lies wholly within the Northern Pacific Rainforest BCR. Environmental ConsequencesPotential effects to federally threatened bird species are analyzed in the wildlife Biological Assessment; there are no known/documented endangered bird species within/near the project assessment area. Potential effects to Forest Service designated Sensitive birds and their habitats are analyzed in the wildlife Biological Evaluation. In addition, effects to management indicator assemblage habitats, and representative avian species, are analyzed in the wildlife Management Indicator Assemblage report. That report assesses the project level effects on birds that represent the management indicator assemblages that will be affected by the various action alternatives considered in detail. Many of the resource protection measures (RPMs) that apply to all action alternatives and connected actions will benefit migratory bird species. A list of RPMs can be found in Chapter 2.  Some of the benefits include: limited operating periods (LOPs) for northern spotted owl (NSO), bald eagles and peregrine falcons will limit potential disturbance or harm to migratory birds, particularly during the breeding season. Riparian reserve buffers and equipment exclusion zones (EEZs) will protect riparian habitats which are very valuable to many migratory bird species, and these protections will greatly benefit species that rely on these habitats. Within EEZs, hand treatments will have limited ground disturbance and will not disturb riparian plant species such as big leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), willow (Salix spp.) and alder (Alnus spp.), unless they are considered hazardous. In summary, implementation of the proposed treatments and connected actions under all project action alternatives would maintain a diversity of functional habitats for migratory birds over the short and longterm, and contribute to long-term sustainability and resilience of migratory bird habitats. Potential effects to individuals and their habitats would be minimized through project design, integrated resource protection measures, adherence to Forest Plan Standards and Guidelines and the Aquatic Conservation Strategy. Conclusions are similar for all project action alternatives. Under the proposed action (alternative 1), alternative 4 and 5, only dead trees and vegetation will be treated or removed. Under alternative 2 and 3, dead and dying trees/vegetation will be treated/removed. Live trees (<10” DBH) and shrubs will also be treated within the fuelbreaks proposed in alternative 2. This fuelbreak slightly increases the total number of acres compared to alternatives 1, 4 and 5 and would have greater impacts on migratory birds and their habitat primarily through changes in the habitat. Alternative 3 proposes to treat a wider buffer than the other four alternatives, therefore it affects the most acres and has the greatest impact on migratory birds and their habitat. Alternative 4 and 5 include the least intensive treatments and affect the lowest number of acres and would have the least amount of impacts on migratory birds and their habitats. Alternative 5 only includes fuels reduction and/or hazard mitigation (no salvage) and has the least impact on migratory birds and their habitat. The no action alternative would not treat or remove any vegetation or trees, therefore trees and vegetation impacted by the wildfires will continue to decay and fall without human influence. The project’s connected actions would have minimal impacts to migratory birds and their habitat because they are located in existing roadbeds and culvert sites which have been previously disturbed and contain limited vegetation. Under all action alternatives, treatments would result in a diversity of habitat types that would be beneficial to migratory bird species in the short-and long-term. Currently, most of the habitat within the treatment areas has been affected by fire, which resulted in dead and dying vegetation. In general, suitable habitat for migratory birds has decreased due to decreased cover and structure, particularly in areas that burned at high or moderate severity. Where fire severity was low, effects to migratory bird habitats was limited. This was the case in the majority of the burned areas. Under all action alternatives, trees would be planted to provide future forest cover, which would benefit migratory birds. Proposed treatments would contribute to a long-term revitalization of migratory bird habitat and a reduction in future fire hazard potential and will have no meaningful influence on population trends of any species of migratory bird. Management Indicator Assemblages Introduction The purpose of this section is to evaluate and disclose the impacts of the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction & Salvage (TPFHR&S) Project on management indicator assemblage habitat identified in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan, USDA 1995). Detailed descriptions of the project alternatives can be found in Chapter 2. Management indicator assemblages are groups of wildlife associated with vegetative communities or key habitat components, as identified in the Forest Plan (page 3-24). The Forest Plan directs resource managers to monitor assemblage habitat trends at the National Forest scale (Forest level). The Forest Plan permits the use of habitat components to represent the management indicator assemblages. This project level report analyzes the effects of the project on habitat of each potentially affected management indicator assemblage, and describes how these effects to habitat may influence Forest level trends. Methodology for Effects Analysis of Management Indicator Assemblages Project level effects on management indicator assemblages are analyzed and disclosed as part of environmental analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act. This involves examining the impacts of the project alternatives on the habitat of each management indicator assemblage by discussing how the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects would change the quantity and/or quality of that habitat in the analysis area. These project level impacts to habitat are then related to broader scale (Forest level) habitat trends. Analyzing project effects to management indicator assemblages involves the following steps: • Identifying which management indicator assemblages have habitat that may be either directly or indirectly affected by the project alternatives. • Analyzing project level effects on the amount of habitat available for each management indicator assemblage, and examining how project habitat effects may influence Forest level assemblage habitat trends. Project effects to assemblage habitat are assessed using forest stand exam data, aerial photography, burn severity indexes, and field surveys. Data collected by silviculturists and wildlife biologists at the stand level are the best available data for project level effects analysis. These data include current tree size (or shrub size for chaparral), forest canopy cover, snag and log density, and location of cliffs, caves, talus and rock outcrops. To provide context for the analysis of project effects to assemblage habitat, this analysis also discusses representative species from the potentially affected management indicator assemblages and relates project effects on habitat to that species. These are typically species for which the Shasta-Trinity National Forest is also gathering population data at the Forest level. Direction for and Implementation of Forest Scale Monitoring for Management Indicator Assemblages Forest level monitoring direction for the Shasta-Trinity National Forest management indicator assemblages is identified in the Monitoring Action Plan of the Forest Plan (USDA 1995, Chapter 5, Page 5-16). The Forest Plan provides direction for Forest scale monitoring of management indicator assemblages using habitat components to represent the assemblages (Forest Plan, page 5-16). Therefore, habitat status and trend is monitored at the Forest scale. 65 Population monitoring is not required. However, the Shasta-Trinity National Forest gathers high quality population data at the Forest level for a number of species. These types of monitoring are described in more detail below. Habitat Status and Trend Monitoring assemblage habitat includes Forest level reporting of habitat status and trend. Habitat status refers to the current amount of management indicator assemblage habitat on the Forest. Habitat trend is the direction of change in the amount of management indicator assemblage habitat between the time the Forest Plan was approved and the present. The Shasta-Trinity Forest Plan provides direction for Forest scale (Forest level) monitoring of management indicator assemblages using habitat components to represent the assemblages (Forest Plan, page 5-16). Habitat components that define each of the nine assemblages are described below in Table 3-33. The habitat components for late seral, openings and early seral, multi-habitat, hardwood, riparian and chaparral assemblages are categorized using the California Wildlife Habitat Relationship (CWHR) System (CDFG 2008). The CWHR System provides the most widely used habitat relationship models for 65 Forest Level Management Indicator Assemblage Report is available at: http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5292949.pdf California’s terrestrial vertebrate species (ibid), and is described further in Appendix A of the Management Indicator Assemblage Report. The Forest wide quantity and distribution of management indicator assemblage habitat are monitored using Gradient Nearest Neighbor (GNN) vegetation layers developed for use in Northwest Forest Plan effectiveness monitoring.66 The GNN vegetation layers are used by regional interagency monitoring teams to evaluate forest conditions in the Northwest Forest Plan area, under the direction of the Regional Interagency Executive Committee.67 The GNN layers are developed by integrating data from field plots (forest inventory data) with satellite imagery and mapped environmental data, using gradient analysis and nearest-neighbor imputation. To assess changes in proportions of assemblage habitat on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest since the time of Forest Plan approval, the GNN layer developed to reflect vegetation in 1994 is compared to the most current GNN layer (2007).68A similar analysis, using vegetationlayers produced by regional monitoring teams, was conducted to evaluate the status and trend of latesuccessional habitat since 1994 in the entire Northwest Forest Plan area (Moeur et al. 2005). The snag and down log assemblage is monitored using data collected at the Forest level by the Forest Service Forest Health Monitoring Program,69 and by the Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Region, Fire and Aviation Management fire and fuels monitoring project.70 The forest health monitoring program monitors forest disease and insect outbreaks through annual aerial surveys that pinpoint new areas of snag recruitment and tracks the progress of previously reported outbreaks. The fire and fuels monitoring program monitors forest fire severity. Moderate and severe fires add large pulses of snags and down logs to the landscape. The Forest management indicator assemblage analysis uses data from annual aerial forest health surveys collected from 1994 through 2009, and wildfire severity data from 1994 through 2008. In addition, the Forest Service Activity Tracking System is used to monitor management activities across the Forest. These data were used to determine areas that consist of older plantations (generally created before 1994), which are known to be deficient in snags and down logs due to past forest management practices. Table 3-33.

Forest level trends for this assemblage are generally static and the occurrence of these habitat components across the Forest is not typically influenced by management. For project analyses, presence of these habitat components are recorded during field surveys to determine whether they are present and may be affected by the project. Population Status and Trend As discussed above, management indicator assemblages are groups of wildlife species associated with particular habitat types. Although population status and trend monitoring is not required by the Forest Plan, the Forest has selected appropriate representative species for several management assemblages and collects and/or compiles data regarding population status and trend for these species at the Forest level. Population status is the current condition of the population measure for the representative species. Population trend is the direction of change in that population measure over time. Population data are compiled and discussed in Forest level monitoring reports, which are issued every 3 to 5 years. 71 Aspen is not strictly a riparian species, but in California it is usually associated with streams, seeps and wet meadows, and it is usually found with other riparian species such as willow and alder (CDFG 2008). 72Aquatics assemblage is analyzed in the fisheries management indicator assemblage report. Selection of Project Level Management Indicator AssemblagesEach Shasta-Trinity National Forest management indicator assemblage was assessed to determine which may be affected by the TPFHR&S Project. Each assemblage was then assigned a category for project analysis (Table 3-34). The categories are: (1) management indicator assemblage habitat type is not in or adjacent to the project area and would not be affected by the project, (2) management indicator assemblage habitat type is in or adjacent to project area, but would not be either directly or indirectly affected by the project, or (3) management indicator assemblage habitat type would be either directly or indirectly affected by the project. The management indicator assemblages analyzed for the project were selected as indicated below in Table 3-34. Table 3-34. Management indicator assemblages for TPFHR&S project-level analysis. Management Indicator Assemblages  Category for Project Analysis*  Late Seral  3  Openings and Early Seral  3  Multi-Habitat  2  Snag and Down Log  3  Riparian  3  Hardwood  3  Chaparral  3  Cliffs, Caves, Talus, Rock Outcrops  2  *Category 1: Assemblage habitat is not in or adjacent to the project area and would not be affected by the project; Category 2: Assemblage habitat is in or adjacent to project area, but would not be either directly or indirectly affected by the project; Category 3: Assemblage habitat would be either directly or indirectly affected by the project. Category 1 Assemblages There are no category 1 assemblages for this project. Category 2 Assemblages Multi-habitat This assemblage is defined by the proportion of each assemblage habitat present, in relation to each other.73 Six assemblages may be affected by this project: openings and early seral, late seral, snag and down log, riparian, hardwood, and chaparral; therefore, the multi-habitat assemblage occurs in the project units. Since the project would not change the amount or distribution of any assemblage, there would be no effect to the proportion of assemblage habitats available. Since the proportions of these six assemblages will not be changed by the project, this assemblage will not be discussed further in this report. Cliffs, Caves, Talus, Rock Outcrops These features are present in the project area; however this assemblage will not be affected by project implementation. The proposed project would not directly or indirectly affect the habitat for this assemblage and would, therefore, have no impact on Forest level habitat trends. This assemblage will not be further discussed in this report. 73 The snag and down log and cliff, cave, talus, and rock outcrop assemblages are not factored in to the proportions of habitat used to define the multi-habitat assemblage because these assemblages are defined by physical features and habitat components that overlay the other assemblages. For example, a snag patch is categorized as openings and early seral and snag and down log assemblage habitat and a rock outcrop on a ridgetop surrounded by shrubs is categorized as chaparral and snag and down log assemblage habitat. Category 3 Assemblages Openings and Early Seral Openings and early seral habitat (Douglas fir, Klamath mixed conifer, montane hardwood conifer, ponderosa pine, red fir, and white fir CWHR types, tree size 1-4) exists in the project area and will be affected by implementation. This assemblage will be affected by implementation of the TPFHR&S Project and these effects are discussed below. Representative Species The Nashville warbler is selected as an appropriate representative species for the openings and early seral assemblage because it is found in all of the openings and early seral assemblage CWHR types, and is strongly associated with specific habitat components that define the assemblage (Table 3-33), and it occurs in the area. Late Seral Late seral habitat (Douglas fir, Klamath Mixed Conifer, montane hardwood conifer, ponderosa pine, red fir, white fir and CWHR types, tree size 5) occurs in the project area and will be affected by project implementation. Representative Species The brown creeper is selected as an appropriate representative species for the late seral assemblage because it is strongly associated with specific habitat components that define the assemblage (large trees), and it occurs in the area. Snag and Down Log Snags and down logs exist in the project area and will be affected by project implementation. Representative Species The red-breasted nuthatch is selected as an appropriate representative species for the snag and down log assemblage because it is strongly associated with specific habitat components that define the assemblage (i.e., snags), and it occurs in the area. Riparian Riparian assemblage habitat (montane riparian) exists along numerous streams within the project area and may be affected by project implementation. Representative Species The yellow warbler is selected as an appropriate representative species for the assemblage because it is strongly associated with specific habitat components that define the assemblage (Table 3-33), and it occurs in the area. Hardwood Hardwood stands (montane hardwood) and individual hardwoods exist in the project area and will be affected by project implementation. Representative Species: The white-breasted nuthatch is selected as an appropriate representative species for the hardwood assemblage because it is strongly associated with specific habitat components that define the assemblage (Table 3-33), and it occurs in the area. Chaparral Chaparral habitat (mixed chaparral and montane chaparral) occurs in the project area and will be affected by project implementation. Representative Species The wrentit is selected as an appropriate representative species for the hardwood assemblage because it is strongly associated with specific habitat components that define the assemblage (Table 3-33), and it occurs in the area. The Nashville warbler shows preference for young, second growth conifer stands, a habitat component that is an indicator for the openings and early seral assemblage. The red-breasted nuthatch shows a strong association with snags, a habitat component that is an indicator for the snag and down log assemblage. The brown creeper shows a strong association with mature stands with large trees, a habitat component that is an indicator for the late seral assemblage. The white-breasted nuthatch shows a strong association with hardwood tree species, a habitat component that is an indicator for the hardwood assemblage. The wrentit shows a strong association with shrubby upland vegetation, a habitat component that is an indicator for the chaparral assemblage. Additionally, population data of high reliability are available for these species, and are tracked/compiled at the Forest level.7475 Although Alternative 1 is the Proposed Action, all alternatives are included throughout this analysis. provides a summary of treatments and CWHR types for each assemblage within each alternative. Due to the variable width buffer proposed under the Proposed Action, assemblage habitat within 300 feet of each side of the road was included in Table 3-35. for the Proposed Action, and in subsequent analysis throughout this report. In reality, the total buffer for the Proposed Action would be 300 feet, not 600 feet. As a result, the number of acres of each assemblage affected within the project area would be much lower than those reflected in these tables (they will be approximately half). Total acres being treated under the Proposed Action would only be 7,969. It should also be noted that the number of acres of salvage treatments has been overstated for all alternatives. Only portions of the salvage units would actually be salvaged because burn severity and subsequent tree mortality is variable throughout the project area. Mortality of commercial sized trees is scattered in pockets, therefore some areas classified as salvage will not actually have salvage opportunities. Connected Actions located outside of the project treatment units are quantified separately and are not included in Table 3-35. Table 3-35.

This table reflects proposed acreages of salvage in late seral habitat, after moving HVWCA NSO nesting/roosting habitat acres from salvage treatment to fuels/road buffer treatment. 6 Salvage will not occur in chaparral habitat due to lack of trees, therefore this table reflects proposed salvage acres after moving chaparral acres from salvage treatment to fuels/road buffer treatment. 7 Snag and down log overlaps with all other assemblages except chaparral 8 Includes hand-felling trees hazardous to the road and leaving on site, as well as planting; no removal or fuels reduction treatments or maintenance. Project Effects on Management Indicator Assemblage Habitat The following section describes the effects of the TPFHR&S Project and its Connected Actions on habitat components of the openings and early seral, late seral, snag and down log, riparian, hardwood and chaparral management indicator assemblages. The analysis used forest stand level vegetation and fuels data obtained from a combination of sources including forest stand exam data, aerial photography, burn severity indexes, and field surveys. These site specific data are the best available data for project level analysis. For each assemblage potentially affected by the project, the biologist evaluates a species strongly associated with the habitat components that define the assemblage. The species analysis is used to provide further context to project effects and the relationship of project habitat impacts to Forest level trends. Table 3-36 summarizes the pre-and post-treatment assemblage acres for Alternative 1. As explained above, due to the variable width buffer proposed under the Proposed Action, the number of acres of each assemblage within the project area will be much lower than those reflected in Table 3-36 (they will be approximately half). Some Connected Actions are located within the proposed project treatment units. Additional impacts from Connected Actions that are located outside of the treatment units will be the same for all alternatives and may impact the openings/early seral and riparian assemblages only. Potential impacts to those two assemblages are described below in their respective sections. Table 3-36.

In reality, the total buffer for the Proposed Action will be 300 feet, not 600 feet, therefore, the affected acres will be much lower (approximately half). Total acres being treated under Proposed Action will only be 7,969. Assemblage  Pre-treatment Habitat Acres* (No Action)  Post Treatment Habitat Acres  Change in MIA Habitat Acres  Riparian  105  105  0  Chaparral  564  564  0  Snag and Down Log78  14,602  14,602  0  *Forest Service ownership only Openings and Early Seral Stage Wildlife Assemblage (Nashville warbler) This assemblage is characterized by trees ranging in size from seedlings to small trees (less than 24” DBH) of blue oak-foothill pine, closed cone pine-cypress, Douglas fir, eastside pine, Jeffrey pine, Klamath mixed conifer, lodgepole pine, montane hardwood conifer, ponderosa pine, red fir, sierran mixed conifer, and white fir CWHR habitat types. Refer to the Management Indicator Assemblages report of exact CWHR habitat typing specifics. Habitat/Species Relationship The Nashville warbler is found in early seral, open, brushy stands of forests and woodlands. The species is strongly associated with the small tree and brush habitat components that are likely to be affected by the project. This species nests on the ground under dense brush in openings within young forests and woodlands (CDFG 2008). Project level Effects Analysis – Openings and Early Seral Assemblage This analysis discloses project effects on the amount of openings and early seral assemblage habitat available (quantitative), and effects of the project on the quality of assemblage habitat in relation to a representative species (Nashville warbler). Habitat Factor(s) for the Analysis (1) Quantitative: Acres with changes in amount of openings and early seral assemblage habitat. (2) Qualitative: Acres with changes in CWHR tree size class. (3) Qualitative: Acres with changes in tree canopy cover. Current Condition of the Habitat Factor(s) in the Project Area This project occurs on approximately 9,706 acres of openings and early seral conditions. The habitat consists of Douglas fir, Klamath mixed conifer, montane hardwood conifer, ponderosa pine, red fir, and white fir CWHR types with size class 0-4 trees and sparse-dense canopy cover. The openings and early seral habitat within the project area includes areas that burned at all severity levels in 2015. Openings and early seral habitat increased as a result of the fires, as some late seral habitats were converted to openings/early seral when they burned at moderate to high severity. Effects of Proposed Action (Alternative 1) Direct and Indirect Effects to Assemblage Habitat The treatment units now consist of habitat conditions that meet the management indicator assemblage definition of openings & early seral habitat. The 9,706 acres of proposed treatments would impact openings and early seral assemblage habitat, including approximately 2,308 acres of high quality Nashville warbler nesting habitat and 4,341 acres of moderate quality nesting habitat (Table 3-37). Due to the variable width buffer proposed under the Proposed Action, all openings/early seral assemblage habitat within 300 feet of each side of the road was included in this analysis. The actual treated buffer will only be 300 feet, not the full 600 feet that was analyzed to capture all potentially treated area. Total acres being 78 Snag and down log assemblage overlaps all other assemblages except chaparral, thus these numbers when summed add up to more than the total number of treatment acres. treated under the Proposed Action will only be 7,969, therefore the amount of openings/early seral assemblage habitat within it will be much lower than 9,706 acres (it will be approximately half). CWHR tree size class would not be changed as a result of this alternative because remaining trees will be characterized as size classes 0-4 after treatment, and these size classes are included under the early seral assemblage. The proposed action would only remove or treat trees and vegetation that are dead (no green limbs) at the time of implementation. Fire killed trees have few if any needles remaining; therefore, canopy cover would not be reduced as a result of the removal of dead trees. Fuels reduction treatments would only treat/remove dead trees and dead vegetation. The proposed treatments may decrease the density of understory vegetation. As a result, although the treated stands would be more open in the understory and have fewer large dead trees, they would continue to provide habitat for species associated with early seral stands. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative (Table 3-37). Effects involve qualitative changes to habitat such as more open understory within early seral forests; however, effects are negligible in the short term since the vegetation is already dead. Table 3-37.

In reality, these acreages will be much lower (approximately half). **Tree size 0=dead trees (due to fire) Cumulative Effects to Assemblage Habitat There is no change in the amount of openings and early seral assemblage habitat as a result of this alternative, so there would not be cumulative effects. Influence of Project Effects to Habitat Status and Trends at the Forest scale There are currently 801,000 acres of openings and early seral assemblage habitat on National Forest System lands in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Within the last decade, the trend for openings and early seral assemblage on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest is steady at 36% of National Forest lands (Table 3-38).79 Although not reflected in this recorded trend for assemblage habitat on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, Northwest Forest Plan monitoring findings reported a net change over the last decade in the amount of older forests80 due to the gradual growth of trees into the lower end of the 20 inch diameter class (Haynes et al. 2006). Across the Northwest Forest Plan area, the actual rate of net increase in older forest was 1.9 percent from 1994-2003, and attributed largely to growth and development of natural stands with quadratic mean diameter greater than 17.7 inches during the 1990’s.81 Researchers report that the increase 79 Based on GNN vegetation analysis of assemblages as defined by CWHR habitat types. 80 Older forest encompasses both mature and old-growth stages and is defined differently than the Forest management indicator assemblages. Older forests are defined in the Northwest Forest Plan by mean diameter of over 20 inches, and the late seral assemblage is defined by mean diameter of over 24 inches. 81 See Haynes et al. (2006), Chapter 6 and Moeur et al. (2005). in older forests during this period was due to a bulge in the size-class distribution of forests with diameters just below the 20-inch class, and estimate the accumulation of older forests will decline as the bulge moves into the greater than 20-inch class. Because the Forest classification of late seral assemblage habitat includes stands with mean diameters greater than 24 inches, these data predict that Forest wide trends would show an increase in late seral and decrease in openings and early seral assemblage habitat in the near future. Table 3-38. Forest wide openings and early seral assemblage over time. Assemblage  Amount of assemblage habitat in 1994 (acres)  Percent of Forest in openings and early seral assemblage in 1994  Amount of assemblage habitat in 2007 (acres)  Percent of Forest in openings and early seral assemblage in 2007  Openings & Early Seral  796,000  36%  801,000  36%  This proposed action would create more fire resistant stands of opening and early seral assemblage with more open understory. To put the project’s influence into perspective, it affects less than 1% of the Forest wide assemblage habitat. Due to the small scale, even if potential unforeseen indirect effects are realized, these effects are not expected to meaningfully influence Forest level habitat trends for management indicator assemblages. Direct and Indirect Effects to Breeding Habitat for Nashville Warbler The openings and early seral habitat in the project units is characterized as Douglas fir, Klamath mixed conifer, montane hardwood conifer, ponderosa pine, red fir, and white fir CWHR types, with tree sizes 14 and sparse to dense canopy cover. Portions of this habitat provide moderate or high quality Nashville warbler nesting habitat. The openings and early seral habitat would persist after treatments, therefore the project area would continue to provide Nashville warbler habitat. In the short term, the proposed action would not decrease habitat suitability for the Nashville warbler because only dead trees and vegetation would be treated/removed and tree size class and canopy cover would not be affected (Table 3-37). In the long term, maintenance treatments to maintain desired fuel loading may reduce density of understory vegetation. However, regrowth of shrubs and young trees both within and outside of treatment areas would result in an increase in habitat suitability for Nashville warblers in the future. Relationship of Project-Level Habitat Impacts to Larger Nashville Warbler Population Trends As described above, Forest level trend in the amount of openings and early seral assemblage habitat is steady (Table 3-38). In the long run, it is likely that early seral assemblage will decline slightly and late seral assemblage will increase slightly due to current and foreseeable forest practices of retaining and encouraging development of late seral forest. Typical practices on private timber land and the occurrence of wildfire on both federal and private lands within the Forest boundaries will continue to create early seral assemblage habitat. Population trends for the Nashville warbler are tracked and compiled at the Forest level.82 These data indicate a potential decline in species occurrence within the BBS strata that overlap the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, but the decline is weakly supported by statistical analysis (Sauer et al. 2008). In light of best available population data, the proposed action effects to habitat, and the ongoing contribution of habitat from wildfires and private timber harvest, the proposed action is not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends and habitat availability for the Nashville warbler. 82 The Forest Level Management Indicator Assemblage Monitoring Report is available at: http://www.fs.usda.gov/main/stnf/landmanagement/planning Effects of Alternative 2 Under Alternative 2, 6,169 acres of open and early seral assemblage would be treated, with 1,454 acres of early seral/openings habitat lying within the fuelbreaks (Table 3-35). Within the fuelbreaks, both live and dead trees and vegetation would be removed or treated, with intensities varying by distance from the road. Within the fuels treatment road buffers and salvage units, dying trees and vegetation would also be removed or treated. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 2 would impact more acres of early seral/opening habitat because its total project footprint is larger than the Proposed Action’s. Under Alternative 2, more acres would have a decrease in canopy cover and understory density. Decreasing canopy cover would improve early seral/opening assemblage habitat for Nashville warbler because sparse to moderate canopy cover is considered moderate to high quality habitat. Openings and early seral habitat will persist after treatments, therefore the project area will continue to provide Nashville warbler habitat. Alternative 2 is not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends for the Nashville warbler. Regrowth of shrubs and young trees both within and outside of treatment areas would result in an increase in habitat suitability for Nashville warblers in the future. Effects of Alternative 3 Under Alternative 3, 9,706 acres of openings and early seral assemblage would be treated (Table 3-35). No acres would be converted from early seral to another assemblage habitat. Within the fuels treatment road buffers and salvage units, dying trees and vegetation would be removed or treated. CWHR tree size class would not be changed as a result of this alternative because remaining trees would be characterized as size classes 0-4 after treatment, and these size classes are included under the early seral assemblage. Although the treated stands would be more open, they would continue to provide habitat for species associated with early seral stands. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, more acres would have a decrease in canopy cover and understory density under Alternative 3. Decreasing canopy cover would improve early seral/opening assemblage habitat because sparse to moderate canopy cover is considered moderate to high quality habitat. Openings and early seral habitat would persist after treatments, therefore the project area would continue to provide Nashville warbler habitat. Alternative 3 is not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends for the Nashville warbler. Regrowth of shrubs and young trees both within and outside of treatment areas would result in an increase in habitat suitability for Nashville warblers in the future. Effects of Alternative 4 Under Alternative 4, 5,168 acres of openings and early seral assemblage would be treated (Table 3-35). CWHR tree size class would not be changed as a result of this alternative because remaining trees would be characterized as size classes 0-4 after treatment, and these size classes are included under the early seral assemblage. Although the treated stands would be more open in the understory and would have fewer large dead trees, they would continue to provide habitat for species associated with early seral stands. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 4 would likely impact a similar number of acres of early seral/opening habitat and would have similar effects as the Proposed Action. However, fuels reduction would occur on 153 fewer acres of early seral/openings habitat under Alternative 4 (due to hazard mitigation only treatments); therefore, in the long term, Alternative 4 would result in some early seral/open stands that are less resilient to fire (Table 3-35). Future fires in those areas would likely burn with increased flame lengths and intensities, resulting in increased mortality of vegetation and trees. Openings and early seral habitat would persist after treatments, therefore the project area would continue to provide Nashville warbler habitat. Alternative 4 is not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends and habitat availability for the Nashville warbler. Regrowth of shrubs and young trees both within and outside of treatment areas would result in an increase in habitat suitability for Nashville warblers in the future. Effects of Alternative 5 Under Alternative 5, 5,168 acres of open and early seral assemblage would be treated (Table 3-35). CWHR tree size class would not be changed as a result of this alternative because remaining trees would be characterized as size classes 0-4 after treatment, and these size classes are included under the early seral assemblage. Although the treated stands would be more open in the understory and would have fewer large dead trees, they would continue to provide habitat for species associated with early seral stands. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 5 would likely impact a similar number of acres of early seral/opening habitat. However, impacts would be less intense because no salvage would occur and fuels reduction would occur on 1,498 fewer acres of early seral/openings habitat under Alternative 5 (Table 3-35). In the long term, Alternative 5 would result in some early seral/open stands that are less resilient to fire. Future fires in those areas would likely burn with increased flame lengths and intensities, resulting in increased mortality of vegetation and trees. Openings and early seral habitat would persist after treatments, therefore the project area would continue to provide Nashville warbler habitat. Alternative 5 is not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends for the Nashville warbler. Regrowth of shrubs and young trees both within and outside of treatment areas would result in an increase in habitat suitability for Nashville warblers in the future. Effects of Connected Actions (All Alternatives) Under all alternatives, road restoration and reconstruction activities may impact the openings and early seral assemblage. Some connected actions are located within the proposed project treatment units, therefore the impacts to opening/early seral vegetation in those areas have already been analyzed and included above. Additional impacts from connected actions located outside treatment units are described below. Road Restoration Road restoration activities that may impact openings/early seral assemblage habitat includes road restoration. Approximately 4.7 miles of roads are proposed for restoration. Some of these proposed roads may be partially overgrown, containing opening/early seral habitat; therefore, approximately 8 acres of openings/early seral habitat may be impacted. Many of these roads lack early seral vegetation, therefore this is an overestimation. Road Reconstruction Road reconstruction activities that may impact opening/early seral habitat includes culvert replacement. The project proposes replacement of 12 culverts that are undersized, worn, or damaged to withstand 100year peak flows and/or debris flows. As a result, approximately 0.6 acres of early seral/openings habitat may be impacted. Summary No acres would be converted from openings/early seral to another assemblage habitat. CWHR tree size class would not be changed as a result of this activity because remaining trees would be characterized as the same size classes after treatment, and the size classes present are included under early seral assemblage. Connected actions are not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends for the Nashville warbler under any alternative. Openings and early seral habitat would persist after treatments, therefore the project area will continue to provide Nashville warbler habitat. Regrowth of shrubs and young trees within treated areas would result in an increase in habitat suitability for Nashville warblers in the future. Late Seral Stage Wildlife Assemblage (brown creeper) This assemblage is defined as: CWHR tree size medium/large (≥24 inches DBH) of blue oak-foothill pine, closed cone pine-cypress, Douglas fir, eastside pine, Jeffrey pine, Klamath mixed conifer, lodgepole pine, montane hardwood conifer, ponderosa pine, red fir, sierran mixed conifer, and white fir CWHR habitat types. Habitat/Species Relationship The brown creeper occupies dense, mature stands of conifer and conifer hardwood habitats, with a relatively closed canopy. The species is strongly associated with large trees and the dense canopy cover that is likely to be affected by the project. This species nests behind loose bark in large trees, and more rarely in tree cavities (CDFG 2008). Preferred brown creeper nesting habitat includes moderate or dense canopy cover and trees greater than 11” DBH (CDFG 2008). Project-level Effects Analysis – Late Seral Assemblage This analysis discloses project effects on the amount of late seral assemblage habitat available (quantitative), and effects of the project on the quality of assemblage habitat in relation to a representative species (brown creeper). Habitat Factor(s) for the Analysis • Quantitative: Acres with changes in amount of late seral assemblage habitat. • Qualitative: Acres with changes in CWHR tree size class. • Qualitative: Acres with changes in tree canopy cover. Current Condition of the Habitat Factor(s) in the Project Area This alternative occurs on 4,365 acres of late seral stand conditions, within the following stand types Douglas fir, Klamath Mixed Conifer, Montane Hardwood Conifer, Ponderosa Pine, Red fir, and White fir with large trees (greater than 24’ DBH) and dense canopy cover. The stands currently provide high quality brown creeper reproductive habitat. Effects of Proposed Action (Alternative 1) Direct and Indirect Effects to Assemblage Habitat The treatment units now consist of habitat conditions that meet the management indicator assemblage definition of late seral assemblage habitat on approximately 4,365 acres (Table 3-39). Due to the variable width buffer proposed under the Proposed Action, all late seral assemblage habitat within 300 feet of each side of the road was included in this analysis. In reality, the total buffer for the Proposed Action would be 300 feet, not 600 feet. Total acres being treated under the Proposed Action would only be 7,969, therefore the amount of late seral assemblage habitat within it would be much lower than 4,365 acres (it would be approximately half). Due to Resource Protection Measures (RPMs) for this project, no salvage will occur within northern spotted owl (NSO) nesting/roosting habitat within High Value Wildlife Conservation Areas (HVWCAs), which is late seral habitat. Throughout this report, the acres of treatment in late seral habitat reflect that fact and therefore, may not match the acres of salvage treatment proposed in other reports, including the EIS. Table 3-39. Direct effects on the late seral assemblage (Proposed Action).* Analysis factors  No Action*  Proposed Action*  Acres of late seral assemblage within treatment units  4,365  4,365  Tree Size Class  5  5  Acres of late seral assemblage with reduction in CWHR tree size class  0  0  Acres of dense canopy cover  4,365  4,365  Acres of late seral assemblage with reduction in CHWR canopy cover class  0  0  *Due to variable width buffer under Proposed Action, this acreage represents the total amount of late seral habitat within 300 feet of each side of road. In reality, these acreages would be much lower (approximately half). The CWHR tree size class would not be changed as a result of this alternative because remaining trees would be characterized as size class 5 after treatment, and this falls within the late seral assemblage definition. The Proposed Action would only remove or treat trees that are dead (no green limbs) at the time of implementation. Fire killed trees have few if any needles remaining, therefore canopy cover would not be changed as a result of the removal/treatment of dead trees. This would not result in a change in assemblage type because this assemblage habitat includes all canopy closure classes of late seral trees. As a result, although the treated stands would be more open in the understory and would have fewer large dead trees, they would continue to provide habitat for species associated with late seral stands. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative (Table 3-39). Cumulative Effects to Assemblage Habitat There is no change in the amount of late seral assemblage habitat from this alternative, so there would not be cumulative effects on the assemblage habitat. Influence of Project Effects to Habitat Status and Trends at the Forest scale Based on the best available data used to track Forest wide management indicator assemblage habitat, 83 there are currently approximately 790,000 acres of late seral assemblage habitat on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Within the last decade, the recorded trend for amount of late seral assemblage habitat on the Forest is steady at 36% of habitat on Shasta-Trinity National Forest lands. Table 3-40 summarizes the trend in late seral assemblage over the last decade on the National Forest. As described above for openings and early seral assemblage, Northwest Forest Plan effectiveness monitoring findings report a net change over the last decade in the amount of older forests84 due to the gradual growth of trees into the lower end of the 20 inch diameter class. Analysis in the Northwest Forest Plan monitoring report found that areas of older forests are stable and expanding, and expectations are for continued increases.85 Even though this trend reported at the Northwest Forest Plan level is not reflected definitively in current Shasta-Trinity assemblage habitat trends for early and late seral habitat, it is likely that Forest wide trends would show an increase in late seral and associated decrease in openings and early seral assemblage habitat in the near future (Haynes et al. 2006). 83 The Forest utilizes data layers developed for Northwest Forest Plan effectiveness monitoring to track Forest wide assemblage habitat. More information is in Habitat Status and Trend section near beginning of this document. 84 Older forest encompasses both mature and old-growth stages and is defined differently than the Forest management indicator assemblages. Older forests are defined in the Northwest Forest Plan by mean diameter of over 20 inches, and the late seral assemblage is defined by mean diameter of over 24 inches. This analysis uses Northwest Forest Plan data, but categorizes the data according to Forest management indicator assemblage definitions (Table 32). 85 See Haynes et al. (2006), Chapter 6 and Moeur et al. (2005). Table 3-40. Forest wide late seral assemblage over time. Assemblage  Amount of assemblage habitat in 1994 (acres)  Percent of Forest in late seral assemblage in 1994  Amount of assemblage habitat in 2007 (acres)  Percent of Forest in late seral assemblage in 2007  Late Seral  785,000  36%  790,000  36%  To put the project’s influence into perspective, it affects less than 0.6% of the Forest wide assemblage habitat. Due to the small scale, even if potential unforeseen indirect effects are realized, these effects are not expected to meaningfully influence Forest level habitat trends for management indicator assemblages. Direct and Indirect Effects to Breeding Habitat for Brown Creeper In the short term, this alternative would slightly decrease habitat suitability for the brown creeper by reducing snag density by removing dead trees, but the habitat would continue to be suitable after treatment. Dense canopy cover in Douglas fir, Klamath Mixed Conifer, montane hardwood conifer, ponderosa pine, red fir, and white fir CWHR habitat types with tree size class 5 occurs in the project units before and after treatment and provides high suitability nesting habitat for brown creepers. Habitat suitability for brown creepers would increase in quality over time as the stand matures. Relationship of Project-Level Habitat Impacts to Larger Brown Creeper Population Trends As described above, Forest level trends show a steady trend in the amount of late seral assemblage habitat (Table 3-40). In the long run, it is likely that early seral assemblage will decline slightly and late seral assemblage will increase slightly due to forest practices of retaining and encouraging development of late seral forest. Alternative 1 impacts are expected to minimally impact brown creeper habitat as no changes to tree size class or reductions in canopy cover class would occur. Typical practices on private timber land will continue, therefore no significant contributions to late seral assemblage are likely to occur outside of Forest boundaries. Alternative effects are consistent with a stable or increasing trend in late seral assemblage and brown creeper habitat. Population trends for the brown creeper are tracked and compiled at the Forest level. These data indicate a fairly stable population within the BBS strata that overlap the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, with a slight lean towards a decline, but the decline is not strongly supported by statistical analysis (Sauer et al. 2008). In light of best available population data, project effects to habitat, and Forest level habitat trends, the project is not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends and habitat availability for the brown creeper. Effects of Alternative 2 Under Alternative 2, 2,636 acres of late seral assemblage would be treated (Table 3-35: sum of all Alt 2 treatments in late seral). The treatment units now consist of habitat conditions that meet the management indicator assemblage definition of late seral assemblage habitat. The CWHR tree size class would not be changed as a result of this alternative because remaining trees would be characterized as size class 5 after treatment, and this falls within the late seral assemblage definition. Canopy cover would be slightly reduced as a result of the removal or treatment of dying trees. However, Alternative 2 would not result in a change in assemblage type because this assemblage habitat includes all canopy cover classes of late seral trees. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 2 would impact more acres of late seral habitat because its total project footprint is larger than the Proposed Action’s. Although the proposed fuelbreaks increase the size of the project compared to the Proposed Action, the impacts to late seral habitat would be similar. Removing small (<10 inch dbh) live trees in the fuelbreaks would not affect the late seral assemblage because it would not affect late seral canopy cover or tree size class. Under Alternative 2, more acres would have a decrease in canopy cover; however, canopy cover is expected to remain dense due to removal of mostly dead trees. Alternative 2 is not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends and habitat availability for the brown creeper. Effects of Alternative 3 Under Alternative 3, 4,365 acres of late seral assemblage would be treated (Table 3-35: sum of all Alt 3 treatments in late seral). Alternative 3 would not result in a change in assemblage type because this assemblage habitat includes all canopy closure classes of late seral trees. As a result, although the treated stands would be more open in the understory and would have fewer large trees, which are predominantly dead, they would continue to provide habitat for species associated with late seral stands. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, more acres of late seral habitat would be impacted by Alternative 3 and more acres would have a decrease in canopy cover. However, canopy cover is expected to remain dense due to removal of mostly dead trees. The late seral assemblage includes all canopy cover classes (sparse to dense), and moderate to high quality brown creeper habitat includes moderate to dense canopy cover. Alternative 3 is not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends and habitat availability for the brown creeper. Effects of Alternative 4 Under Alternative 4, 2,272 acres of late seral assemblage would be treated. Within high value areas (northern spotted owl (NSO) nesting, roosting, foraging, and post fire foraging habitat in NSO territories or Critical Habitat), hazard trees would be hand felled and left on site and no removal or fuels reduction treatments would occur (hazard mitigation only, followed by tree planting) on 1,958 acres ( ). NSO nesting, roosting, and foraging habitat is all considered late seral assemblage habitat, therefore under this alternative, late seral habitat is subject to hazard mitigation only (and tree planting).The CWHR tree size class would not be changed as a result of this alternative because remaining trees would be characterized as size class 5 after treatment, and this falls within the late seral assemblage definition. Alternative 4 would only remove or treat trees that are dead (no green limbs) at the time of implementation. Fire-killed trees have few if any needles remaining, therefore canopy cover would not be changed as a result of the removal or treatment of dead trees. Although the treated stands would be more open in the understory and would have fewer large dead trees, they would continue to provide habitat for species associated with late seral stands. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 4 would likely impact a similar number of acres as the Proposed Action of late seral habitat. However, compared to the Proposed Action, fuels reduction and salvage would occur on 1,958 fewer acres of late seral habitat under Alternative 4 (due to hazard mitigation only treatments); therefore, in the long term, Alternative 4 would result in some late seral stands that are less resilient to fire. Future fires in those areas would likely burn with increased flame lengths and intensities, resulting in increased tree mortality, which would decrease the quality of late seral habitat. Effects of Alternative 5 Under Alternative 5, 2,272 acres of late seral assemblage would be treated. No salvage would occur in this alternative. Within sensitive areas (NSO nesting, roosting, foraging, and post-fire foraging habitat, riparian reserves, inventoried roadless areas, and at-risk watersheds), hazard trees would be hand felled and left on site and no removal or fuels reduction treatments would occur (hazard mitigation only, followed by tree planting). Therefore, under Alternative 5, the late seral assemblage (which is comprised of NSO nesting/roosting and foraging habitat) would be subject to hazard mitigation only (and tree planting). The CWHR tree size class would not be changed as a result of this alternative because remaining trees would be characterized as size class 5 after treatment, and this falls within the late seral assemblage definition. Alternative 5 would only remove or treat trees that are dead (no green limbs) at the time of implementation. Fire-killed trees have few if any needles remaining, therefore canopy cover would not be changed as a result of the removal or treatment of dead trees. Although the treated stands would have fewer large dead trees, they would continue to provide habitat for species associated with late seral stands. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 5 would likely impact a similar number of acres of late seral habitat as the Proposed Action. However, no fuels reduction or salvage would occur within late seral habitat under Alternative 5 (due to hazard mitigation only treatments); therefore, in the long term, Alternative 5 would result in late seral stands that are less resilient to fire. Future fires would likely burn with increased flame lengths and intensities, resulting in increased tree mortality, which would decrease the quality of late seral habitat. Snags and Down Log Assemblage (red-breasted nuthatch) This assemblage is defined as conifer and hardwood habitats with substantial snags and down logs. Habitat/Species Relationship The red-breasted nuthatch is strongly associated with snags. This species nests in cavities that they excavate in rotted wood, especially snags (CDFG 2008). Preferred red-breasted nuthatch nesting habitat includes stands with canopy cover ranging from open/sparse to dense and trees greater than 24’ DBH (CDFG 2008). Project-level Effects Analysis – Snag and Down Log Assemblage This analysis discloses project effects on the amount of snag and down log assemblage habitat available (quantitative), and effects of the project on the quality of assemblage habitat in relation to a representative species (red-breasted nuthatch). Habitat Factor(s) for the Analysis • Quantitative: Acres with changes in amount of snag and down log assemblage habitat. • Qualitative: Acres with changes in density of snag and/or down logs. Current Condition of the Habitat Factor(s) in the Project Area The project occurs within the 144,000 acre perimeter of the fires that burned on the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in 2015. This project occurs on 14,602 acres of snag and down log assemblage habitat. Given the mosaic pattern of fire severity across the project area, combined with the various pre-fire tree densities, the full range of snag density levels is present. The mature stands in the project currently provide high quality red-breasted nuthatch habitat, with large trees and numerous snags. Effects of Proposed Action (Alternative 1) Direct and Indirect Effects to Assemblage Habitat The TPFHR&S Project proposes treatments on approximately 14,602 acres of snag and down log assemblage (Table 3-41). These actions would impact the snag and down log assemblage habitat. Within 6,831 of these acres, fuels reduction would occur and snags would be salvaged (felled and removed from the landscape). Within the remaining 7,771 acres, fuels reduction would occur and snags would be felled and left on site as logs. Within those acres, wood products may be utilized for commercial or personal firewood, or biomass removal. Intermittent salvage may also occur in areas outside of northern spotted owl (NSO) nesting/roosting habitat within High Value Wildlife Conservation Areas (HVWCAs). Due to the variable width buffer proposed under this alternative, all snag and down log assemblage habitat within 300 feet of each side of the road was included in this analysis. In reality, the total buffer for this alternative is 300 feet, not 600 feet. Total acres being treated under this alternative would only be approximately 7,969, therefore the amount of snag and down log assemblage habitat within it would be much lower than 14,602 acres (it would be approximately half). Due to Resource Protection Measures (RPMs) for this project, no salvage will occur within northern spotted owl (NSO) nesting/roosting habitat within High Value Wildlife Conservation Areas (HVWCAs).  Throughout this report, the acres of treatment in snag and down log habitat reflect that fact and therefore, may not match the acres of salvage treatment proposed in other reports, including the EIS. RPMs for this project also include retention of snags and logs. Within NSO nesting/roosting, foraging, and post-fire foraging type 1 (PFF1) areas in HVWCAs, at least 15 tons of coarse woody debris (CWD86) per acre would be retained for wildlife benefit, where it is available (CWD = snags 15 inches or greater in diameter and logs greater than 20 inches diameter and 10 feet long). Snags and logs in advanced states of decay (snag and log decay classes 3-5) and/or with deformities such as cat faces, broken or forked tops, hollows or cavities would be prioritized for retention. Within NSO nesting/roosting, foraging, and post-fire foraging type 1 (PFF1) areas outside of HVWCAs, an average of at least 10 tons of CWD per acre will be retained for wildlife benefit, where it is available. Within Riparian Reserves, 20 tons/acre of large woody debris would be retained, when possible. The Proposed Action would only remove or treat trees that are dead (no green limbs) at the time of implementation. The treatment units are long thin units along roadsides and snags and down logs are abundant just outside of the treatment units and throughout the fire perimeter. The snag and down log density would be reduced as a result of this alternative. Although the treated stands would be less densely stocked with snags, this alternative would continue to provide habitat for species associated with snag and down log assemblage (Table 3-41). Table 3-41. Direct effects on the snag component of assemblage habitat (Proposed Action)1 Habitat Component  No Action (Pre-implementation)1  Proposed Action (Postimplementation)1  Snag and down log assemblage  14,602 acres  14,602 acres  Salvage & Fuels Treatment (6,831 acres)  Average Snag Density >15”DBH within salvage units  10 snags/acre  2 snags/acre  Fuels Treatment (7,771 acres)2  Average Snag Density >15”DBH within fuels treatment units  8 snags/acre  2 snags/acre  1Due to variable width buffer under Proposed Action, these acreages represent the total amount of snag and down log habitat within 300 feet of each side of road. In reality, these acreages will be much lower (approximately half). 2 Fuels treatment includes felling trees and leaving on site (no salvage), and potential utilization of wood products for commercial or personal firewood, biomass removal etc. Within these areas, intermittent salvage may occur in areas outside of northern spotted owl (NSO) nesting/roosting habitat within High Value Wildlife Conservation Areas (HVWCAs). Cumulative Effects to Assemblage Habitat There is no change in amount of snag and down log assemblage from this alternative, so there would not be cumulative effects on amount of snag and down log assemblage. Influence of Project Effects to Habitat Status and Trends at the Forest scale The snag and down log assemblage is defined as conifer and hardwood habitats with substantial snags and down logs. The habitat components defining the assemblage (snags and down logs) also occur within the other assemblages and are evaluated at the project level using site-specific data (forest stand data). At the Forest level, the amount of assemblage habitat is tracked using annual aerial survey data which provides information about forest mortality due to insect and disease, and wildfire data. Because snags and down logs are habitat components found within the other assemblages, the amount of snag and down log 86 CWD and LWD are used interchangeably. assemblage tracked at the Forest level is known to represent only a portion of the habitat that provides snags and down logs throughout the Forest. Since 1994 snags have been recruited in large pulses by disease mortality and fire on 591,100 acres of National Forest System lands in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Snags are not permanent features on the landscape (Cluck and Smith 2007, Landram et al. 2002), and when they fall they contribute to the log component and continue to provide snag and down log assemblage habitat. Snags and logs are known to be deficient in plantations due to past management practices; therefore, there is a deficiency of snags on 67,700 acres of National Forest System Lands. Also, snags and logs are not usually retained on private timber land, so snag and down log assemblage is likely restricted to National Forest System lands. Table 3-42. Forest wide trends in snag and down log assemblage habitat. Assemblage  Total amount of assemblage contributed since 1994 (acres)  Gain due to wildfire since 1994 (acres)  Gain due to disease since 1994 (acres)  Acres of Snag Deficiency  Snag and Down Log  591,100  177,300  413,800  67,700  As shown in Table 3-42, snag and down log assemblage habitat continues to increase over time due to wildfire events and insect and disease outbreaks. Contributing forces to the recruitment of snags involves the overall health and flammability of forests. The Forest Service monitors forest health through field reconnaissance and annual aerial surveys. Aerial surveys report areas containing current-year conifer and hardwood mortality, defoliation, and other damage; more information is found at: http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/spf/fhp/fhm/aerial/index.shtml. Any decreases in the snag habitat component would be localized and due to vegetation and fuels management actions such as linear fuel management zones or private forestry where Forest Plan snag retention guidelines do not apply. The amount of snag and down log habitat may also be reduced due to intense wildfires that consume snags and logs, and slowly due to natural decomposition. Implementation of this alternative would not meaningfully reduce the amount of snag and down log assemblage habitat at the Forest level. While snags would be removed under this alternative, in most areas snag felling would be limited to roadside hazard trees. There are abundant snags and down logs directly adjacent to the treatment area throughout the fire perimeter. To put the project’s influence into perspective, it affects only 2% of the Forest wide assemblage habitat. Typical practices on private timber land would continue to create a lack of snags and logs on private lands. The occurrence of disease outbreaks and wildfire are likely to continue at the current rate because there are still large areas with high fuel loading (due to fire suppression), and management of diseased stands occurs at small scales. Extensive areas within the 2015 fire complexes adjacent to the project area would remain untreated, and abundant snags and logs would be available and recruited in the future as trees continue to die. However, maintenance treatments would fell some of them. Direct and Indirect Effects to Breeding Habitat for Red-breasted Nuthatch In the short term, this Alternative would decrease habitat suitability for the red-breasted nuthatch by reducing the density of snags in treatment units. Douglas fir, Klamath mixed conifer, Ponderosa pine, Red fir, and White fir CWHR habitat types with tree size classes 4 and 5 and sparse to dense canopy cover (as occurs within units before and after this alternative) provides moderate and high suitability nesting habitat for red-breasted nuthatches as long as the stands include snags (Table 3-43). Felling and removing snags and logs may reduce quality habitat for the red-breasted nuthatch. Table 3-43. Summary of treatments within moderate and high quality nesting habitat for the red-breasted nuthatch (Proposed Action)1 Treatment Prescription  Acres of Treatment within High and Moderate Quality Nesting Habitat1  Salvage & Fuels Treatment  High – 2,099 Moderate – 2,970  Fuels Treatment2  High – 2,597 Moderate – 2,837  1 Due to variable width buffer under Proposed Action, these acreages are based upon the total amount of snag and down log habitat within 300 feet of each side of road. In reality, these acreages will be much lower (approximately half). 2 Fuels treatment includes felling trees and leaving on site (no salvage), and potential utilization of wood products for commercial or personal firewood, biomass removal etc. Within these areas, intermittent salvage may occur in areas outside of northern spotted owl (NSO) nesting/roosting habitat within High Value Wildlife Conservation Areas (HVWCAs). While a relatively large number of acres may be impacted by this alternative, not all snags would be felled and/or removed within the treatment units. In many areas, only trees identified as hazard trees87 would be felled. RPMs would retain some snags (where they are not hazardous) and down logs on site for wildlife benefit. In the long term, tree planting would accelerate growth of forest stands and development of old growth conditions more quickly than the no action alternative. This would cause habitat suitability for red-breasted nuthatches to increase in quality over time as the stand matures. Under the no action alternative, trees impacted by the wildfires would continue to decay and fall without human influence. Relationship of Project-Level Habitat Impacts to Larger Red-breasted Nuthatch Population Trends Alternative effects to red-breasted nuthatch habitat include decreases in habitat suitability due to reduced snag density. Forest wide snag and down log assemblage habitat continues to increase over time, and late seral habitat (which provides recruitment of snags and down logs) has a current trend of steady with potential for future increases. Because this alternative affects only a small fraction of the red-breasted nuthatch habitat available Forest wide, it is not likely to have any meaningful influence on Forest wide habitat trends. Population trends for the red-breasted nuthatch are tracked and compiled at the Forest level. These data indicate a potential increase in species occurrence within the BBS strata that overlap the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, and this increase is supported by statistical analysis in the Pitt-Klamath strata and the South Pacific Rainforest strata that occur on the Forest, as well as range-wide (Sauer et al. 2008). In light of best available population data, project effects to habitat, and Forest level habitat trends, the project is not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends and habitat availability for the red-breasted nuthatch. Effects of Alternative 2 Under Alternative 2, 9,238 acres of snag and down log assemblage would be treated (Table 3-35). Within 4,873 of these acres, dead/dying trees that are felled would be salvaged (removed from the landscape) and fuels reduction and/or fuelbreaks would occur. Within the area that would not be commercially salvage logged (4,365 acres), dead/dying trees would be felled and fuels reduction and/or fuelbreak treatments would occur. Within these areas, wood products may be utilized for commercial or personal firewood, or biomass removal. Intermittent salvage may also occur in areas outside of northern spotted owl (NSO) nesting/roosting habitat within High Value Wildlife Conservation Areas (HVWCAs). Trees felled may 87As identified in Hazard Tree Guidelines for Forest Service Roads and Facilities in the Pacific Southwest Region (Angwin et al 2012). also be treated for fuels reduction purposes but 10 to 20 tons/acre (depending on the location) of downed logs would be retained. In addition to felling dead trees, Alternative 2 would fell trees that have a 60% probability of mortality. As a result, this alternative’s effects to this assemblage would be greater than those of the Proposed Action, which would only fell trees that are completely dead at time of implementation. The density of snags and down logs would be reduced as a result of Alternative 2, however the project units would continue to provide habitat for species associated with the snag and down log assemblage. RPMs, as described above under the Proposed Action, include retention of snags and logs on site for wildlife benefit. This alternative’s effects would not result in the loss of any acres of this assemblage. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 2 would impact more acres of snag and down log habitat because its total project footprint is larger than the Proposed Action’s (Table 3-44). Table 3-44.

Within 6,831 of these acres, fuels reduction would occur and snags would be salvaged (felled and removed from the landscape). Within the remaining 7,771 acres, fuels reduction would occur and snags would be felled and left on site as logs. Within those acres, wood products may be utilized for commercial or personal firewood, or biomass removal. Intermittent salvage may also occur in areas outside of northern spotted owl (NSO) nesting/roosting habitat within High Value Wildlife Conservation Areas (HVWCAs). Trees felled may also be treated for fuels reduction purposes. In addition to removing/treating dead trees, Alternative 3 would fell trees that have a 60% probability of mortality. As a result, this alternative’s effects to this assemblage would be greater than those of the Proposed Action, which would only fell trees that are completely dead at time of implementation. The density of snags and down logs would be reduced as a result of Alternative 3, however the project units would continue to provide habitat for species associated with the snag and down log assemblage. RPMs, as described above under the Proposed Action, include retention of snags and logs on site for wildlife benefit.. This alternative’s effects would not result in the loss of any acres of this assemblage. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 3 would impact more acres of snag and down log habitat because its total project footprint is larger than the Proposed Action’s (Table 3-45). Table 3-45.

Alternative 4 would only remove or treat trees that are dead (no green limbs) at the time of implementation. The density of snags and down logs would be reduced as a result of Alternative 4, however the project units would continue to provide habitat for species associated with the snag and down log assemblage. RPMs, as described above under the Proposed Action, include retention of snags and logs on site for wildlife benefit. As a result, this alternative’s effects would not result in the loss of any acres of this assemblage. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 4 would impact about the same number of acres of snag and down log habitat as the Proposed Action. The effects of Alternative 4 would be less intense than the Proposed Action because on 2,128 acres of snag and down log habitat, snags would be felled and left on site as logs (hazard mitigation only, no fuels reduction or other removal) (Table 3-46). Table 3-46.

No salvage would occur in this alternative (Table 3-47). Alternative 5 would only remove or treat trees that are dead (no green limbs) at the time of implementation. The density of snags and down logs would be reduced as a result of Alternative 5, however the project units would continue to provide habitat for species associated with the snag and down log assemblage. This alternative’s effects would not result in the loss of any acres of this assemblage. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 5 would impact about the same number of acres of snag and down log habitat as the Proposed Action. The effects of Alternative 5 would be less intense than the Proposed Action because on 3,869 acres of snag and down log habitat, snags would be felled and left on site as logs (hazard mitigation only, no fuels reduction or other removal) (Table 3-47). Table 3-47.

The species tends to be associated with large oaks. This species nests in cavities in large trees or snags excavated by themselves or by woodpeckers. Preferred white-breasted nuthatch nesting habitat includes trees greater than 11” DBH in hardwood woodland or hardwood conifer stands (CDFG 2008). Project-level Effects Analysis – Hardwood Assemblage This analysis discloses project effects on the amount of hardwood assemblage habitat available (quantitative), and effects of the project on the quality of assemblage habitat in relation to a representative species (white-breasted nuthatch). Habitat Factor(s) for the Analysis 1. Quantitative: Acres with changes in amount of hardwood assemblage habitat. 2. Qualitative: Acres with changes in CWHR tree size class. 3. Qualitative: Acres with changes in hardwood canopy cover. Current Condition of the Habitat Factor(s) in the Project Area This project occurs on 426 acres of montane hardwood assemblage habitat. The hardwood assemblage habitat in the project area consist of montane hardwood woodland with all CWHR tree size classes and all canopy cover classes. The project area provides some moderate and high quality nesting habitat for the white-breasted nuthatch. Effects of Proposed Action (Alternative 1) Direct and Indirect Effects to Assemblage Habitat The TPFHR&S Project proposes to conduct fire salvage, roadside treatments (fuels reduction and dead tree removal or treatment), tree planting, and/or maintenance on approximately 426 acres of hardwood assemblage habitats (Table 3-48). Due to the variable width buffer proposed under the Proposed Action, all hardwood assemblage habitat within 300 feet of each side of the road was included in this analysis. In reality, the total buffer for the Proposed Action would be 300 feet, not 600 feet. Total acres being treated under the Proposed Action would only be 7,969, therefore the amount of hardwood assemblage habitat within it would be much lower than 426 acres (it would be approximately half). Treatment of hardwood trees would be limited to hazard tree abatement and fuels treatments (no hardwoods would be commercially salvaged). Some hardwood stands have a minor conifer component; therefore, within hardwood stands, scattered dead conifer trees may be felled. For the proposed action, only trees and vegetation that are completely dead (no green limbs at time of implementation) would be treated or removed. The CWHR tree size class would not be changed as a result of this alternative, thus the project would not result in a change in assemblage because all hardwood tree size classes are included in the hardwood assemblage. Hardwood density would be slightly reduced as a result of this alternative, however this alternative would not result in a change in assemblage type because assemblage habitat includes all densities of hardwood trees. Changes in hardwood canopy cover are expected to be negligible. Fire killed hardwoods have few if any leaves remaining, therefore canopy cover would not be changed as a result of the removal or treatment of dead trees. The treated stands would continue to provide habitat for species associated with hardwood stands (Table 3-48). There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. Table 3-48. Direct effects on the hardwood assemblage at the project scale (Proposed Action)* Analysis factors  No Action*  Proposed Action*  Acres hardwood assemblage within treatment units  426  426  Acres of change in CWHR habitat tree size  0  0  Acres of change in hardwood canopy cover  0  0  *Due to variable width buffer under Proposed Action, this acreage represents the total amount of hardwood habitat within 300 feet of each side of road. In reality, these acreages would be much lower (approximately half). Cumulative Effects to Assemblage Habitat There is no change in the amount of hardwood assemblage habitat from this alternative, so there would not be cumulative effects on the assemblage habitat. Influence of Project Effects to Habitat Status and Trends at the Forest scale There are currently 323,000 acres of hardwood assemblage habitat on National Forest System lands in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Within the last decade, the trend for hardwood assemblage on the Forest is steady at 15% of habitat on National Forest system lands (Table 3-49). Table 3-49. Forest wide hardwood assemblage over time. Assemblage  Amount of assemblage habitat in 1994 (acres)  Percent of Forest in hardwood assemblage in 1994  Amount of assemblage habitat in 2007 (acres)  Percent of Forest in hardwood assemblage in 2007  Hardwood  334,000  15%  323,000  15%  In the long term, this proposed action would not affect Forest wide trends in hardwood assemblage habitat because it would not affect the amount of hardwood assemblage habitat available. Direct and Indirect Effects to Breeding Habitat for White-breasted Nuthatch The hardwood assemblage habitat in the project units consists of montane hardwood habitat of all CWHR size classes and canopy covers. Of this hardwood assemblage habitat, approximately 89 acres are high quality and 5 acres are moderate quality nesting habitat for white-breasted nuthatch. The hardwood habitat would maintain these characteristics after treatments, thus the hardwood habitat would continue to provide moderate and high quality habitat after implementation. Treatments may slightly decrease the quality of white-breasted nuthatch habitat through the felling of scattered hardwood hazard trees, but this alternative is not expected to have any measurable adverse effect on white-breasted nuthatch habitat. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. Relationship of Project-Level Habitat Impacts to Larger White-breasted Nuthatch Population Trends As described above, the hardwood assemblage habitat Forest level trend is steady (Table 3-49). Implementation of this project would not affect the Forest wide steady trend in hardwood assemblage habitat, because no change in amount of assemblage habitat would occur. Project effects are consistent with Forest level trends that indicate hardwood assemblage habitat is being maintained over time. Typical practices on private timber land would continue, so no significant contributions to hardwood assemblage are likely to occur outside of Forest boundaries. To put the project’s influence into perspective, it affects 0.1% of the Forest wide hardwood assemblage habitat and it would continue to provide this type of habitat post-project. Population trends for the white-breasted nuthatch are tracked and compiled at the Forest level. These data indicate a potentially increasing population within the BBS strata that overlap the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. This increase is supported by statistical analysis in the Pitt-Klamath BBS strata (Sauer et al. 2008). In light of best available population data, project effects to habitat, and Forest level habitat trends, the project is not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends and habitat availability for the white-breasted nuthatch. Effects of Alternative 2 Under Alternative 2, 378 acres of hardwood assemblage habitat would be treated (Table 3-35). Of this hardwood assemblage habitat, approximately 53 acres are high quality and 4 acres are moderate quality nesting habitat for white-breasted nuthatch. Fire killed trees have few if any leaves remaining, therefore canopy cover would not be changed as a result of the removal or treatment of dead trees. In addition to removing/treating dead trees, Alternative 2 would remove or treat trees that have a 60% probability of mortality, as well as other dead and dying vegetation. Hardwood canopy cover and density would be slightly reduced as a result of the removal or treatment of dead or dying trees and vegetation, as well as small diameter (<10 inch DBH) live trees in the fuelbreaks. Hardwoods would not be commercially salvaged.  CWHR tree size class would not be changed and this alternative would not result in a change in assemblage type because this assemblage habitat includes all canopy cover classes and all densities of hardwood trees. The treated stands would be slightly more open and less densely stocked with trees; however, they would continue to provide habitat for species associated with hardwood stands. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 2 would impact more acres of hardwood habitat because its total project footprint is larger than the Proposed Action’s. Compared to the Proposed Action, more acres would have a decrease in hardwood canopy cover and density under Alternative 2. Effects of Alternative 3 Under Alternative 3, 426 acres of hardwood assemblage would be treated (Table 3-35). Of this hardwood assemblage habitat, approximately 89 acres are high quality and 5 acres are moderate quality nesting habitat for white-breasted nuthatch. Alternative 3 would remove or treat trees that have a 60% probability of mortality, as well as other dead and dying vegetation. Hardwood canopy cover and density would be slightly reduced as a result of the removal or treatment of dead or dying trees and vegetation. Hardwoods would not be commercially salvaged. The CWHR tree size class would not be changed as a result of this alternative, thus this alternative would not result in a change in assemblage because all hardwood tree size classes are included in the hardwood assemblage. Alternative 3 would not result in a change in assemblage type because this assemblage habitat includes all canopy cover classes and all densities of hardwood trees. Although the treated stands would be slightly more open and less densely stocked with trees, they would continue to provide habitat for species associated with hardwood stands. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 3 would impact more acres of hardwood habitat because its total project footprint is larger than the Proposed Action’s. Compared to the Proposed Action, more acres would have a decrease in hardwood canopy cover and density under Alternative 3. Effects of Alternative 4 Under Alternative 4, 216 acres of hardwood assemblage would be treated (Table 3-35). Of this hardwood assemblage habitat, approximately 59 acres are high quality and 4 acres are moderate quality nesting habitat for white-breasted nuthatch. Under this Alternative, only dead trees and vegetation will be treated and/or removed. No hardwoods would be commercially salvaged. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. The effects of this alternative to hardwood assemblage habitats would be the same as the Proposed Action. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 4 would impact about the same number of acres of hardwood habitat. Effects of Alternative 5 Under Alternative 5, 216 acres of hardwood assemblage would be treated (Table 3-35). Of this hardwood assemblage habitat, approximately 59 acres are high quality and 4 acres are moderate quality nesting habitat for white-breasted nuthatch. Under this Alternative, only dead trees and vegetation will be treated and/or removed. No hardwoods would be commercially salvaged. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. The effects of this alternative to hardwood assemblage habitats would be the same as the Proposed Action. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 5 would impact about the same number of acres of hardwood habitat. Riparian Wildlife Assemblage (yellow warbler) This assemblage is defined as all tree sizes and all canopy cover classes of Montane riparian, valley foothill riparian, and aspen CWHR habitat types. Habitat/Species Relationship The yellow warbler occupies streamside riparian habitats with shrubby, open canopied structure. The species is strongly associated with riparian vegetation such as willows, cottonwoods and alders that are not likely to be affected by the project. This species nests in shrubby understories of riparian habitat (CDFG 2008). Project-level Effects Analysis – Riparian Assemblage This analysis discloses project effects on the amount of riparian assemblage habitat available (quantitative), and effects of the project on the quality of assemblage habitat in relation to a representative species (yellow warbler). Habitat Factor(s) for the Analysis 1. Quantitative: Acres with changes in amount of riparian assemblage habitat. 2. Qualitative: Acres with changes in CWHR tree size class. 3. Qualitative: Acres with changes in canopy cover. Current Condition of the Habitat Factor(s) in the Project Area This project occurs on approximately 105 acres of montane riparian habitat with size 1-4 trees and all canopy covers. Due to the steep terrain of the vast majority of the project area, riparian vegetation is very limited and highly restricted to the immediate edges of streams, when present at all. The amount of riparian vegetation calculated and analyzed likely overstates the actual amount within the project area. Effects of Proposed Action (Alternative 1) Direct and Indirect Effects to Assemblage Habitat The TPFHR&S Project proposes to conduct fire salvage, roadside treatments (fuels reduction and dead tree removal or treatment), tree planting, and/or maintenance on approximately 105 acres of riparian assemblage habitats (Table 3-35). Some habitat within the treatment units now consist of habitat conditions that meet the management indicator assemblage definition of riparian habitat. Total acres being treated under the Proposed Action would only be 7,969, therefore the amount of riparian assemblage habitat within it would be much lower than 105 acres (it would be approximately half). The Proposed Action would only remove or treat trees and vegetation that are dead (no green limbs) at the time of implementation. Treatment of riparian species (examples include but are not limited to big leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), willow (Salix spp.) and alder (Alnus spp.)) would be limited to hazard tree abatement (no riparian tree species would be salvaged). This project contains resource protection measures (RPMs) for Riparian Reserves which would protect the riparian habitat assemblage. Within Riparian Reserves, Equipment Exclusion Zones (EEZs) exist along perennial and intermittent streams and wetlands (Riparian Reserve boundaries and EEZs are much wider than the actual riparian assemblage vegetation). Hand treatments that may occur within EEZs would not treat green vegetation or disturb riparian plant species such as big-leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), willow (Salix spp.) and alder (Alnus spp.). Snags felled in riparian areas will typically be left on site unless there is a site specific reason for removing them, such as heavy fuel loading (greater than 20 tons/acre). Changes in riparian canopy cover are expected to be negligible. Fire killed trees have few if any leaves remaining, therefore canopy cover would not be changed as a result of the removal or treatment of dead trees. The CWHR tree size class and riparian canopy cover would not be changed as a result of this alternative, and this alternative would not result in a change in assemblage because all riparian tree size classes and canopy cover classes of riparian vegetation are included in the riparian assemblage. As a result, the project area would continue to provide habitat for species associated with riparian vegetation (Table 3-50). Although there is a slight possibility that trees felled within riparian areas may fall on riparian vegetation, there would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. Table 3-50. Direct effects on the riparian assemblage at the project scale (Proposed Action)* Analysis factors  No Action*  Proposed Action*  Acres riparian assemblage within treatment units  105  105  Acres of change in CWHR habitat tree size  0  0  Acres of change in canopy cover  0  0  *Due to variable width buffer under Proposed Action, this acreage represents the total amount of riparian habitat within 300 feet of each side of road. In reality, these acreages would be much lower (approximately half). Cumulative Effects to Assemblage Habitat There is no change in the amount of riparian assemblage habitat from this alternative, so there would not be cumulative effects on the assemblage habitat due to this alternative. Influence of Project Effects to Habitat Status and Trends at the Forest scale According to Forest level estimates, there are currently 1,500 acres of riparian assemblage habitat mapped on National Forest System lands in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. 88 Within the last decade, the trend for riparian assemblage on the Forest is steady at 0.07% of habitat on National Forest lands. The steady trend in amount of Forest wide riparian assemblage habitat would be expected due to implementation of the Aquatic Conservation Strategy since 1994, which focuses on maintaining and restoring aquatic and riparian ecosystems on National Forest lands (Table 3-51). 88 Since this assemblage is narrowly defined and difficult to track at the Forest level due to the fine resolution required to detect the occurrence of streamside vegetation, the Forest wide acreage figure is likely an underestimate of actual riparian assemblage habitat on the Forest. Table 3-51. Forest wide riparian assemblage over time. Assemblage  Amount of assemblage habitat in 1994 (acres)  Percent of Forest in riparian assemblage in 1994  Amount of assemblage habitat in 2007 (acres)  Percent of Forest in riparian assemblage in 2007  Riparian  1,500  0.07%  1,500  0.07%  Due to the small amount of riparian habitat potentially impacted by the project, even if potential unforeseen indirect effects are realized, these effects are not expected to meaningfully influence Forest level habitat trends for management indicator assemblages. Effects of this proposed action are consistent with the steady Forest wide trend for riparian assemblage habitat as the action would not result in a change in the amount of riparian habitat. The project would make the riparian assemblage habitat more resilient to fire damage, and thus more sustainable over time. Direct and Indirect Effects to Breeding Habitat for Yellow Warbler The riparian habitat in the project units is characterized as Montane riparian CWHR type, with CWHR tree sizes 1-4 and sparse to dense canopy cover. This habitat provides moderate and high quality yellow warbler nesting habitat, which would persist after treatments because the project is designed to avoid impacts to riparian vegetation. In the long term, there would be little difference in the quality of riparian assemblage habitat between the proposed action and no action because of the minimal effects of the proposed action to riparian assemblage habitats. Relationship of Project-Level Habitat Impacts to Larger Yellow Warbler Population Trends As described above, the Forest level trend for riparian assemblage habitat is steady (Table 3-51). Project effects are consistent with the steady Forest wide trend in riparian assemblage habitat. Implementation of this project would not affect the Forest wide trend because it would not increase or decrease the amount of riparian assemblage habitat available. Qualitative effects to yellow warbler habitat are expected to have no measurable effect on habitat quality in the short term or the long term. Population trends for the yellow warbler are tracked and compiled at the Forest level. These data indicate a potentially decreasing population within the BBS strata that overlap the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. This decrease is supported by statistical analysis in the California foothills BBS strata (Sauer et al. 2008). In light of best available population data, project effects to habitat, and Forest level habitat trends, the project is not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends and habitat availability for the yellow warbler. Effects of Alternative 2 Under Alternative 2, 55 acres of riparian assemblage habitat would be treated (Table 3-35). Treatment of riparian vegetation would be limited to hazard tree abatement, no riparian tree species would be salvaged. Per the RPMs (see description under Proposed Action above), hand treatments that may occur within EEZs would not treat green vegetation or disturb riparian plant species such as big-leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), willow (Salix spp.) and alder (Alnus spp.), unless they are considered hazardous. Overstory canopy cover (above riparian vegetation) would be slightly reduced as a result of the removal or treatment of dying non-riparian species hazard trees, as well as live non-riparian trees and vegetation in the fuelbreaks. Only four acres of riparian vegetation exists within the fuelbreaks. Canopy cover of riparian species would be slightly reduced in some areas because hazardous riparian tree species would be treated/removed. However, fire-killed trees would have few if any leaves left. The CWHR tree size class would not be changed as a result of this alternative, and this alternative would not result in a change in assemblage because all riparian tree size classes and canopy cover classes of riparian vegetation are included in the riparian assemblage. The treated stands would be slightly more open and less densely stocked with trees, they would continue to provide habitat for species associated with riparian vegetation. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 2 would impact more acres of riparian habitat because its total project footprint is larger than the Proposed Action’s. Compared to the Proposed Action, more acres would have a decrease in canopy cover and density under Alternative 2. Effects of Alternative 3 Under Alternative 3, 105 acres of riparian assemblage would be treated (Table 3-35). Treatment of riparian vegetation would be limited to hazard tree abatement, no riparian tree species would be salvaged. Per the RPMs (see description under Proposed Action above), hand treatments that may occur within EEZs would not treat green vegetation or disturb riparian plant species such as big-leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), willow (Salix spp.) and alder (Alnus spp.), unless they are considered hazardous. Overstory canopy cover (above riparian vegetation) would be slightly reduced as a result of the removal or treatment of dying non-riparian species hazard trees. Canopy cover of riparian species would be slightly reduced in some areas because hazardous riparian tree species would be treated/removed. However, fire-killed trees would have few if any leaves left. The CWHR tree size class would not be changed as a result of this alternative, and this alternative would not result in a change in assemblage because all riparian tree size classes and canopy cover classes of riparian vegetation are included in the riparian assemblage. Although the treated stands would be slightly more open and less densely stocked with trees, they would continue to provide habitat for species associated with riparian vegetation. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 3 would impact more acres of riparian habitat because its total project footprint is larger than that of the Proposed Action and Alternative 2. Compared to the Proposed Action, more acres would have a decrease in canopy cover and density under Alternative 3. Effects of Alternative 4 Under Alternative 4, 48 acres of riparian assemblage habitat would be treated (Table 3-35). Treatment of riparian vegetation would be limited to hazard tree abatement, no riparian tree species would be salvaged. Within all treatment units, riparian species would not be removed or treated unless they are completely dead at time of implementation. Per the RPMs (see description under Proposed Action), hand treatments that may occur within EEZs would not treat green vegetation or disturb riparian plant species such as big-leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), willow (Salix spp.) and alder (Alnus spp.). The CWHR tree size class and riparian canopy cover would not be changed as a result of the alternative, and this alternative would not result in a change in assemblage because all riparian tree size classes and canopy cover classes of riparian vegetation are included in the riparian assemblage. The project area would continue to provide habitat for species associated with riparian vegetation. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. The effects of this alternative to the riparian assemblage would be similar to the Proposed Action. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 4 would impact about the same number of acres of riparian habitat. Effects of Alternative 5 Under Alternative 5, 48 acres of riparian assemblage habitat would be treated (Table 3-35). Treatment of riparian vegetation would be limited to hazard tree abatement, no riparian tree species would be salvaged. The same Riparian Reserve RPMs under the Proposed Action apply to Alternative 5. The CWHR tree size class and riparian canopy cover would not be changed as a result of the alternative, and this alternative would not result in a change in assemblage because all riparian tree size classes and canopy cover classes of riparian vegetation are included in the riparian assemblage. The project area would continue to provide habitat for species associated with riparian vegetation. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 5 would impact about the same number of acres of riparian habitat as Alternative 1. In the short term, the impacts would be less under Alternative 5 because treatments are less intense within Riparian Reserves. However, in the long term, since fuels reduction, including removal of felled hazard trees, would not occur within Riparian Reserves, Alternative 5 may result in riparian areas that are less resilient to fire. Effects of Connected Actions (All Alternatives) Under all alternatives, road reconstruction activities, specifically culvert replacement, may impact the riparian assemblage. Some connected actions are located within the proposed project treatment units, therefore the impacts to riparian vegetation in those areas have already been analyzed and included above. Additional impacts from connected actions located outside treatment units are described below. Due to the steep terrain of the vast majority of the project area, riparian vegetation is very limited and highly restricted to the immediate edges of streams, when present at all. The amount of riparian vegetation calculated and described below is likely an overestimate. Road Restoration The project proposes to restore approximately 4.7 miles of roads. Beyond the road closures, measures would be implemented, as necessary, to reduce sediment delivery from the road surface to make it hydrologically neutral. These measures may include removing all structures including culverts. The majority of the proposed roads are in dry upland areas, far from waterways. Two of the proposed roads cross an intermittent creek, however riparian vegetation is not expected to be present due to lack of consistent or perennial flow. None of the proposed roads cross perennial creeks; therefore, impacts to riparian vegetation are not expected. Road Reconstruction The project proposes replacement of 12 culverts that are undersized, worn, or damaged to withstand 100year peak flows and/or debris flows. Some minor excavation of sediment depositions on the upstream side of the crossings near the culvert inlets may also be required. Vegetation is generally limited or lacking on fill slopes above culverts; however, a small amount of riparian vegetation within and outside of the fill slope may be present. As a result, approximately 0.4 acres of riparian habitat may be impacted. Road Maintenance The project proposes maintenance activities at 35 culverts, including clearing culvert inlets and outlets of debris or installing riprap to remediate erosion. These activities will be conducted by equipment from the roadway, or by hand, therefore, impacts to riparian vegetation will be very minimal. Summary The CWHR tree size class and riparian canopy cover would not be changed as a result of the Connected Actions, and these activities would not result in a change in assemblage. All riparian tree size classes and canopy cover classes are included in the riparian assemblage. Impacts to riparian vegetation will be very minimal; therefore, connected actions are not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends or habitat availability for the yellow warbler. The project area would continue to provide habitat for species associated with riparian vegetation. Chaparral (chamise-redshank, mixed, and montane chaparral) Wildlife Assemblage (wrentit) This assemblage is defined as: all shrub sizes and all shrub density classes of chamise-redshank chaparral, mixed chaparral, and montane chaparral CWHR habitat types. Habitat/Species Relationship The wrentit occupies chaparral habitats with dense structure (CDFG 2008). The species is strongly associated with dense chaparral vegetation that is likely to be affected by the project. This species nests in dense shrubs (CDFG 2008). Preferred wrentit nesting habitat includes moderate to dense chaparral vegetation in all ages and size classes Project-level Effects Analysis – Chaparral Assemblage This analysis discloses project effects on the amount of chaparral assemblage habitat available (quantitative), and effects of the project on the quality of assemblage habitat in relation to a representative species (wrentit). Habitat Factor(s) for the Analysis 1. Quantitative: Acres with changes in amount of chaparral assemblage habitat. 2. Qualitative: Acres with changes in shrub size class. 3. Qualitative: Acres with changes in shrub density. Current Condition of the Habitat Factor(s) in the Project Area This alternative occurs on 564 acres of montane and mixed chaparral habitat of all CWHR shrub size classes and sparse to moderate densities. The 2015 fires burned at all severity levels, however approximately 60% of the chaparral habitat within the project area burned at moderate to high severity (25-100% basal area mortality). As a result of the fires, chaparral densities have decreased; however the project area provides some moderate quality nesting habitat for the wrentit. Effects of Proposed Action (Alternative 1) Direct and Indirect Effects to Assemblage Habitat The TPFHR&S Project proposes to conduct roadside treatments (fuels reduction) and maintenance on approximately 564 acres of chaparral assemblage habitats (Table 3-35). In this area, 368 acres (65%) of the chaparral habitat burned at moderate to high severity (25-100% basal area mortality). The remaining 196 acres burned at low severity. Some habitat within the treatment units now consist of habitat conditions that meet the management indicator assemblage definition of chaparral habitat. Due to the variable width buffer proposed under the Proposed Action, all chaparral assemblage habitat within 300 feet of each side of the road was included in this analysis. In reality, the total buffer for the Proposed Action would be 300 feet, not 600 feet. Total acres being treated under the Proposed Action would only be 7,969, therefore the amount of chaparral assemblage habitat within it would be much lower than 564 acres (it would be approximately half). Effects to chaparral would be limited to fuels reduction treatments and maintenance and only shrubs dead at the time of implementation would be treated. Dead shrubs would be reduced by 50-100%. The CWHR shrub size class would not be changed as a result of this alternative, and this alternative would not result in a change in assemblage because all chaparral shrub size classes are included in the chaparral assemblage. Chaparral density would not be reduced as a result of this alternative because only dead shrubs would be treated. In the future (10-15 years after implementation), maintenance treatments may be prescribed to maintain desired fuel loading levels. These treatments may decrease the density of understory vegetation, including chaparral; however this would not result in a change in assemblage type because chaparral assemblage habitat includes all shrub density classes of chaparral vegetation. The project area would continue to provide habitat for species associated with chaparral vegetation (Table 3-52). There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. There would likely be an overall increase in chaparral habitat within the project area (and within the fire footprint outside of the project area) due to the effects of the fires. Table 3-52. Direct effects on the chaparral assemblage at the project scale (Proposed Action)* Analysis factors  No Action*  Proposed Action*  Acres chaparral assemblage within treatment units  564  564  Acres of change in CWHR habitat shrub size  0  0  Acres of change in shrub density  0  0  *Due to variable width buffer under Proposed Action, this acreage represents the total amount of chaparral habitat within 300 feet of each side of road. In reality, these acreages would be much lower (approximately half). Cumulative Effects to Assemblage Habitat There is no change in the amount of chaparral assemblage habitat from this alternative, so there would not be cumulative effects on the assemblage habitat. Influence of Project Effects to Habitat Status and Trends at the Forest scale There are currently 58,000 acres of chaparral assemblage habitat mapped on National Forest System lands in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Within the last decade, the trend for chaparral assemblage on the Forest is steady at 3% of habitat on National Forest lands (Table 3-53). Table 3-53. Forest wide chaparral assemblage over time. Assemblage  Amount of assemblage habitat in 1994 (acres)  Percent of Forest in chaparral assemblage in 1994  Amount of assemblage habitat in 2007 (acres)  Percent of Forest in chaparral assemblage in 2007  Chaparral  58,000  3%  58,000  3%  In the long term, this proposed action would not affect Forest wide trends in chaparral habitat because it would not change the amount of habitat at the project level. To put the project’s influence into perspective, it affects less than 1% of the Forest wide assemblage habitat. Due to the small scale, even if potential indirect effects are realized, these effects are not expected to meaningfully influence Forest level habitat trends for management indicator assemblages. Direct and Indirect Effects to Breeding Habitat for Wrentit The chaparral assemblage habitat in the project units consists of montane and mixed chaparral habitat of all CWHR size classes and sparse to moderate densities. The areas of this habitat that burned at low severity likely still provide some moderate quality nesting habitat for the wrentit. The areas that burned at moderate to high severity likely had high shrub mortality and do not currently have enough cover to be suitable for nesting. Most chaparral species are adapted to fire, responding to moderate to high severity fires by sprouting from the root collar within one year of the burn (McElroy, 2016), therefore in the longterm, chaparral densities are expected to recover. This alternative’s treatments would not reduce shrub density because only dead shrubs would be treated, thus in the short-term, habitat quality for the wrentit would not be reduced. In the future (10-15 years after implementation), site specific maintenance treatments will be prescribed to maintain desired fuel loading levels. These treatments may decrease the density of understory vegetation, including chaparral. However, in untreated parts of the project area (and within the fire footprint outside of the project area) there would likely be an overall increase of nesting habitat for wrentit due to the effects of the fires. Relationship of Project-Level Habitat Impacts to Larger Wrentit Population Trends As described above, Forest level trends show a steady trend in chaparral habitat (Table 3-53). Implementation of this project would likely not affect the Forest wide steady trend in chaparral assemblage habitat. Minor effects caused by this alternative are not likely to meaningfully impact Forest level habitat trends. Population trends for the wrentit are tracked and compiled at the Forest level. These data indicate a fairly stable population within the BBS strata that overlap the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Most of the BBS strata that occur on the Forest show a slight decline, but these declines are not statistically supported. The population appears to be increasing in the Pitt-Klamath BBS strata, and this increase is statistically supported (Sauer et al. 2008). In light of best available population data, project effects to habitat, and Forest level habitat trends, the project is not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends and habitat availability for the wrentit. Effects of Alternative 2 Under Alternative 2, 284 acres of chaparral assemblage habitat would be treated (Table 3-35). Some habitat within the treatment units now consist of habitat conditions that meet the management indicator assemblage definition of chaparral habitat. Within the fuelbreaks, there are only 19 acres of chaparral habitat (Table 3-35). The CWHR shrub size class would not be changed as a result of this alternative, and this alternative would not result in a change in assemblage because all chaparral shrub size classes are included in the chaparral assemblage. This alternative treats both dead and dying vegetation, as well as live vegetation in the fuelbreaks; therefore, chaparral density would be reduced. However, this would not result in a change in assemblage type because this assemblage habitat includes all shrub density classes of chaparral vegetation. Although the treated stands would be more open, they would continue to provide habitat for species associated with chaparral vegetation. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of Alternative 2. Treatments may reduce the density of chaparral, however, there would likely be an overall increase in chaparral habitat in untreated parts of the project area (and within the fire footprint outside of the project area) due to the effects of the fires. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 2 would impact more acres of chaparral habitat because its total project footprint is larger than the Proposed Action’s. Compared to the Proposed Action, more acres would have a decrease in shrub density, due to the treatments of dying vegetation as well as live vegetation within the fuelbreaks. Effects of Alternative 3 Under Alternative 3, 564 acres of chaparral assemblage would be treated (Table 3-35). There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. This alternative treats both dead and dying vegetation; therefore, chaparral density would be reduced. However, this would not result in a change in assemblage type because this assemblage habitat includes all shrub density classes of chaparral vegetation. Although the treated stands would be more open, they would continue to provide habitat for species associated with chaparral vegetation. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of Alternative 3. Treatments may reduce the density of chaparral, however, there would likely be an overall increase in chaparral habitat in untreated parts of the project area (and within the fire footprint outside of the project area) due to the effects of the fires. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 3 would impact more acres of chaparral habitat because its total project footprint is larger than the Proposed Action’s. Compared to the Proposed Action, more acres would have a decrease in shrub density, due to the treatments of dying vegetation. Effects of Alternative 4 Under Alternative 4, 265 acres of chaparral assemblage habitat would be treated (Table 3-35). Only vegetation dead at the time of implementation would be treated. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative and the effects of this alternative to chaparral assemblage habitats would be the same as the Proposed Action. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 4 would impact about the same number of acres of chaparral habitat. Effects of Alternative 5 Under Alternative 5, there are 265 acres of chaparral assemblage habitat within the treatment units (Table 3-35). Only shrubs dead at the time of implementation would be treated. Of the total chaparral assemblage within Alternative 5 units, 38 acres of chaparral would not be affected because it is within units that would only undergo hazard mitigation (no removal or fuels reduction treatments). Thus, 227 acres of chaparral may be treated. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative and the effects of this alternative to chaparral assemblage habitats would be the same as the Proposed Action. However, when the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, fewer acres of chaparral would be impacted by Alternative 5 than Alternative 1 due to the hazard mitigation only treatments. Hydrology__________________________________ Methodology A water quality evaluation is required for all environmental impact analyses to identify the water quality implications of proposed and alternative land management practices (FSM 2530). This requirement is satisfied in the analysis below by identifying: (1) designated beneficial uses of the watersheds, (2) pollutants in the watersheds, (3) sources of the pollutants, and (4) causes of the pollutants. Beneficial uses are designated by the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board for each of the waterbodies within its jurisdiction (Cal. EPA North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board. 2011). Whether a waterbody meets the needs of designated beneficial uses is the primary criterion for water quality. Pollutants that are impairing the designated uses are identified in the State of California’s integrated report to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on sections 303(d) and 305(b) of the Clean Water Act (Cal. EPA, State Water Resources Control Board. 2015). General sources and causes of pollution are addressed in the Total Maximum Daily Loads developed by the U.S. EPA. Specific sources and causes of pollution are addressed in the effects analysis and the sediment source inventory (Appendix D). Equivalent Roaded Area, Indirect Effects, and Cumulative Watershed Effects An assessment of the potential for cumulative watershed effects (CWE) is required for proposed activities (R5 FSH 2509.22, Chapter 20). The approach adopted by the Forest Service Pacific Southwest Region uses the equivalent roaded area (ERA) model developed by Haskins (1983) to make a preliminary assessment of watershed conditions by comparing the effects of past, existing, and reasonably foreseeable actions to a watershed threshold of concern (TOC). ERA disturbance factors used by the Shasta-Trinity National Forest were developed using the coefficients described by Haskins (1986), surrounding forests, and scientific literature. Disturbance factors for each type of activity are described by an equation of the form: 𝑦𝑦= 𝑎𝑎+ 𝑏𝑏∗ln(𝑥𝑥) where y is the disturbance factor, a is a disturbance constant, b is a recovery coefficient, and x is duration in years (The duration is the difference of the assessment year from the disturbance year). Activities used to model the proposed action and alternatives include tractor clear cut, tractor thin, chip and masticate, mechanical pile and burn, hand pile and burn, and road decommissioning89. It is assumed that salvage logging in moderate to high severity burned areas will be approximately a clear cut, and salvage logging in unburned to low severity burned areas will be approximately a thin. The constants and coefficients of each of these activities are identified in The Physical Sciences Report. The disturbance factor y is multiplied by the activity area in acres to calculate the ERA for the assessment year. The implementation of an activity with a positive disturbance constant (such as mechanical piling and burning) will cause the ERA of a watershed to increase, and a negative recovery coefficient will cause the ERA to decline (the watershed will recover). The rate of recovery is dependent upon the recovery coefficient. For example, for mechanical piling and burning, the disturbed area will recover by about 22% after three years and by about 68% after thirty years. A negative recovery coefficient (such as road decommissioning) will cause the ERA to decrease as the watershed recovers from the disturbance. The total amount of sediment produced by the Proposed Action that will eventually enter surface water bodies has been estimated for each hydrologic unit. The equivalent roaded area of each alternative was calculated using the ERA model, and converted to a total in tons based on an estimated 13.6 tons/road mile calculated from the WEPP model (described in the Soils section of this report on page 173). Finally, 89 Landings are assumed to be part of logging activity in the hydrologic model, but are not explicitly analyzed with respect to location, number, or size. Likewise, road use is assumed to be part of the logging activity in the hydrologic model. based on the connectivity of roads and proposed activities to stream courses, it was assumed that about 30% of the total sediment produced would eventually enter a stream (Christine Mai, Forest Service Hydrologist, personal communication). We know that stream buffers and other resource protection measures can reduce the amount of sediment entering a stream, but even approximately predicting the amount of sediment at the watershed scale is difficult to determine due to the numerous variables. Therefore, the results should be viewed as best guess approximations of the amount of sediment that may reach the streams, rather than accurate forecasts of what we know will happen. CWE were analyzed by estimating the ERAwithin each hydrologic unit (HUC90 5 to 8). Theresults were compared against the TOC established for each watershed that range from 12 to 18 percent ERA (Appendix H of USDA Forest Service, 1995b). The cumulative watershed effects in this report are shown as a risk ratio of the ERA disturbance relative to the TOC91 (Table 3-54). A risk ratio greater than 1 means the watershed is over the TOC. Effects of the 2015 wildfires, fire suppression, and proposed project activities are forecast for a five year period. All other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions within the affected hydrologic units that can be accounted for were also modeled. Past disturbances include: urban development, agricultural crops and grazing, road construction, railroad and powerline development, mines, timber harvest (including timber salvage on private lands after the 2015 fires), fuels treatments, and other wildfires. Present and future foreseeable projects that have been modelled include: Kellogg Fuels Reduction, Burnt Ranch, Sims Fire Restoration, PG&E Transmission Line Salvage, Gemmill, Westside Plantation, and Rattlesnake. Table 3-54. CWE risk matrix (Mai, 2015). Disturbance Level Rating  Magnitude  Geographic Extent  Duration and Frequency  Low Risk ratio < 0.4  Effect: not measurable  Negligible Effects  Negligible Effects  Moderate Risk ratio < 0.8  Effect: Potential for small sediment increase; no impact to fish or water quality  Impacts are minor locally and result in minimal offsite impacts  Short-term, onetime effect  High Risk ratio < 1.0  Effect: Potential for moderate increase in sediment– minor stress on fish and minor increase in turbidity  Impacts are moderate immediately offsite but do not translate to watershed scale impacts  Moderate; intermittent effect  Very High Risk ratio > 1.0  Effect: Potential for substantial increase in sediment; major stress on fish and large increase in turbidity and degraded water quality  Impacts are large immediately offsite and may translate to watershed scale impacts & degraded fisheries habitat  Long-term, potentially chronic effect  Best Management PracticesBest management practices (BMPs) are required to control nonpoint source pollution related to all management actions with the potential to affect water quality on National Forest System lands (FSM 2532), and all NEPA decisions are to incorporate site-specific BMPs for protecting water quality (FSH 2509.22). BMPs from the Forest Service National BMPs (USDA, 2012) have been selected for this project (Appendix C). Additionally, project specific RPMs have been developed for the protection of water quality and Riparian Reserves (Chapter 2 of this document). Unless specifically indicated otherwise, all identified BMPs and RPMs apply to all watersheds and all alternatives. 90 The hydrologic unit code (HUC) uniquely identifies each hydrologic unit. The number associated with the HUC relates to watershed size—higher numbers refer to smaller watersheds. Each hydrologic scale is represented by two numbers. A HUC 5 is a ten digit code, a HUC 7 is a 14 digit code, etc. 91 TOC is developed only for HUC5s and HUC6s. Therefore, for HUC7s and HUC8s, the HUC6 TOC is used to calculate the risk ratio. Sediment Source InventoryAn inventory of controllable sediment discharge sources and other legacy sites that may affect water quality within project boundaries and along appurtenant National Forest System roads is required for NEPA analyses for timber harvest, fuels, and vegetation management actions that include ground-disturbing activities (FSH 2509.22, Chapter 10). Sediment Source Inventory reports used to compile this information include: NSR, 2011 (Middle South Fork Trinity River and Upper South Fork Trinity River), NRM 2012 (New River), NSR 2012 (Browns Creek, Canyon Creek, Lower Hayfork Creek, Lower South Fork Trinity River and Upper Hayfork Creek). Proposed treatment areas that were not previously surveyed were field inventoried by USFS in 2015/2016 and sites previously inventoried with high and moderate priority for treatments were also revisited by USFS. A list of sites for each subwatershed (HUC 6)is provided in the Sediment Source Inventory Report developed for this project (Appendix D). Affected Environment Portions of ten watersheds (HUC 5) in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest were burned by fires in 2015 (Table 3-55 and Figure 3-10). Seven watersheds comprise the bulk of the fire area; these include Browns Creek, Burnt Ranch, Lower Hayfork Creek, Lower South Fork Trinity River, Middle South Fork Trinity River, New River, and Upper Hayfork Creek. Lower Trinity River experienced only four acres of moderate to high severity burned area and about 13 acres of total burned area, and is not considered further in this analysis. Table 3-55.

EPA North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, 2011). Aquaculture is a potential future beneficial use. The South Fork Trinity River sub-basin (HUC 4) is included on California’s Clean Water Act Section 303(d) list as water quality limited due to sediment (Cal. EPA State Water Resources Control Board, 2015). The sediment impairment has resulted in non-attainment of water quality standards and is adversely affecting designated beneficial uses – specifically commercial and sport fishing; cold freshwater habitat; rare, threatened, and endangered species; migration of aquatic organisms; and spawning, reproduction, and/or early development. A sediment source assessment conducted by the U.S. EPA identified general sources and causes of sediment in the South Fork Trinity River sub-basin (U.S. EPA, 1998).The dominant source of sediment is the steep and mountainous, highly erodible terrain located west of the South Fork Trinity River (predominately in the Lower South Fork Trinity River watershed, and to a lesser degree in the Middle and Upper South Fork Trinity River watersheds). Major causes of sediment include mass wasting (natural, timber harvest-related, and road-related), road surface erosion, road washouts and gullies, hillslope surface erosion (natural and timber harvest-related), and stream bank erosion (U.S. EPA, 1998). Mass wasting is by far the dominant process, accounting for about 64% of the total sediment. Management-related sources (timber harvest, roads, and cumulative/other-mass wasting and bank erosion) account for about 35% of the total sediment. Roads are associated with about 18% of the total sediment delivery, and timber harvesting is associated with about 9%. Roads are the most significant cause of management-related sediment production. The South Fork Trinity River sub-basin is also impaired for temperature; it is too high to fully support aquatic habitat (U.S. EPA, 1998). High temperatures may result from natural conditions, water diversions, loss of riparian vegetation, and excess sedimentation that has resulted in channel widening and decreased water depths. Table 3-56. Baseline disturbance level of the affected watersheds. Watershed (HUC 5)  Risk Ratio by Year  Disturbance Level  2016  2018  2020  Browns Creek  0.44 0.42 0.41  Moderate  Burnt Ranch  0.47 0.49 0.48  Moderate  Canyon Creek  0.25 0.26 0.26  Low  Lower Hayfork Creek  0.42 0.39 0.38  Moderate to Low  Lower South Fork Trinity River  0.56 0.53 0.50  Moderate  Middle South Fork Trinity River  0.60 0.66 0.68  Moderate  New River  0.33 0.31 0.30  Low  Upper Hayfork Creek  0.35 0.32 0.29  Low  Upper South Fork Trinity River  0.24 0.23 0.23  Low  Lower Hayfork Creek The disturbance level of in Lower Hayfork Creek watershed is moderate in 2016 and reduces to low by 2018 (Table 3-56. For the sub-watersheds, the disturbance level is moderate in Corral Creek; moderate to low in Grassy Flat-Miners Creek; and low in Rusch-Creek-Little Creek, Salt Creek-Hayfork Creek and Tule Creek-Hayfork Creek. Only one hydrologic unit has a high disturbance level (1801021204010504 in Lower Salt Creek-Hayfork Creek), but its disturbance level recovers to moderate by 2018. Lower South Fork Trinity River The disturbance level in Lower South Fork Trinity River is moderate (Table 3-56). For Eltapom Creek, the disturbance level is moderate; and for Hyampom, the disturbance level is very high (Physical Sciences Report Table 19). Hyampom is a “planning watershed92,” and planning watersheds that are over TOC, regardless of ownership, are not to be further impacted unless they can be improved with appropriate mitigation measures (Forest Plan, page 4-25). 92 The watershed boundaries used by the Shasta-Trinity National Forest today are not the same as the boundaries of the watersheds identified in the Forest Plan EIS. “Planning watersheds” as defined in the Forest Plan have similar geographic extent to the watersheds (HUC 5) and subwatersheds (HUC 6) in use today. Middle South Fork Trinity River The disturbance level in Middle South Fork Trinity River watershed is moderate (Table 3-56). Middle South Fork Trinity River is a Key Watershed. For Cave Creek-Miller Springs and Rattlesnake Creek-Post Mountain sub-watersheds, the disturbance level is moderate. The disturbance level of Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat is considered to be very high. Middle South Fork Trinity River is a planning watershed. Planning watersheds that are over TOC, regardless of ownership, are not to be further impacted unless they can be improved with appropriate mitigation measures (Forest Plan, page 4-25). In the Cave Creek-Swift Creek drainage, one sub-drainage (1801021202020101) is considered to have a very high disturbance level in 2016, but reduces to a high level of disturbance due to natural recovery by 2018. Upper Hayfork Creek The disturbance level is low in the Upper Hayfork Creek watershed for a projected five year period (Table 3-56), and low in each of the affected subwatersheds, except for Natural Bridge which is moderate in 2016 and reduces to low based on natural recovery rates by 2018 (Table 21-Physical Sciences Report). Upper South Fork Trinity River The disturbance level in the Upper South Fork Trinity River watershed (Table 3-56) and Smoky Creek subwatershed is low (Table 22-Physical Sciences Report). Upper South Fork Trinity River is a Key Watershed. Trinity River (subbasin)Existing designated beneficial uses of water for the Trinity River include: municipal, domestic, agricultural, and industrial supply; groundwater recharge and freshwater replenishment; navigation; hydropower generation; water contact recreation and non-contact water recreation; commercial and sport fishing; cold freshwater habitat; wildlife habitat; rare, threatened, and endangered species; migration of aquatic organisms; spawning, reproduction, and/or early development; and aquaculture (Cal. EPA North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board. 2011). Industrial process supply is a potential future beneficial use. Some portions of the Trinity River sub-basin (HUC 4) are on California’s Clean Water Act Section 303(d) list because the state has determined that the water quality standards are exceeded due to excessive sediment and mercury (Cal. EPA Water Resources Control Board, 2015). The mercury impairment occurs outside the project area and is not considered further in this section. New River is not sediment impaired. A portion of Burnt Ranch is sediment impaired, and Lower Trinity River, Canyon Creek and Browns Creek are sediment impaired. The sediment impairment has resulted in non-attainment of designated beneficial uses – specifically commercial and sport fishing; cold freshwater habitat; rare, threatened, and endangered species; migration of aquatic organisms; and spawning, reproduction, and/or early development. Sources and causes of sediment in the Trinity River sub-basin were assessed by the U.S. EPA (2001).The dominant source of sediment is the Lower Trinity River watershed with a total sediment yield about twice the rate of the other watersheds. For the Upper Middle Trinity River area (including Browns Creek), about 57% of the sediment yield was management related, with roads being a slightly greater cause than timber harvest. For the Lower Middle Trinity River area (including New River, Burnt Ranch and Canyon Creek), only about 19% of the total sediment yield was caused by management related activities, with roads (17%) yielding a much greater sediment supply than timber harvest (1%). Browns Creek The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects is moderate in Browns Creek for a projected five year period (Table 3-56). In East Fork Browns Creek, the risk is moderate in 2016 and reduces to low by 2018. Burnt Ranch The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects is moderate in Burnt Ranch for a projected five year period (Table 3-56). For the sub-watersheds, the risk in Big French Creek and Burnt Ranch Gorge is low, and moderate in Don Juan Creek. Canyon Creek The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects is low in Canyon Creek for a projected five year period (Table 3-56), and moderate in Lower Canyon Creek (Table 25-Physical Sciences Report). New River The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects in the New River watershed is low for a projected five year period (Table 3-56). New River is a Key Watershed. For the sub-watersheds, the risk is low in Big Creek-New River, Devils Canyon, and Lower New River. It is moderate in Sixmile Creek. In Upper New River, the risk is moderate in 2016 and reduces to low by 2018. Desired Condition The Aquatic Conservation Strategy (ACS) objectives in the Forest Plan (Page 4-53) provide direction for watershed management on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The ACS objectives were developed to maintain and restore the ecological health of the aquatic ecosystems of the forest. The ACS Compliance document found in Appendix E of the EIS describes the objectives, the existing conditions, future improvements, and the relationship between this project’s alternatives and each of the objectives. Effects Analysis The extent (geographic boundaries) of this analysis is each of the hydrologic units (HUC 5 through HUC 8)in which treatments occur. The duration of the analysis is from 2016 to 2020 for several reasons. First, the potential for indirect effects is reduced over time and is often not evident within 5 years after project implementation. Second, there are no foreseeable future projects beyond 2019. Finally, although a watershed may take more than 5 years to recover from cumulative effects, it is expected that significant long term, potentially chronic effects, will be present only in watersheds over TOC (Table 3-54). Alternative 1 (Proposed Action) Direct Effects Direct effects include sediment that immediately enters streams as a result of project activities. Examples include the felling of trees into streams, and sediment directly entering streams at road/stream crossings. Direct effects may also include a small increase in temperature due to a loss of canopy cover when the trees in Riparian Reserves are felled. Riparian Reserves provide a variety of important functions, including the control of sediment delivery to receiving waters from uplands, and control of streambed and bank stability. Timber harvest activities and road use accelerate soil erosion and sedimentation in streams by exposing mineral soil to erosive forces. If sediment delivery from human activities significantly exceeds natural levels, then sediment deposition, channel instability, and high levels of turbidity can occur. Estimated required widths of unmanaged near-stream vegetation in forested watersheds needed to control sediment is about 150 feet (USDA Forest Service, 2007). Due to the fact that Forest Service System roads often intersect Riparian Reserves, it is not feasible to have an entirely unmanaged vegetation corridor in Riparian Reserves. However, project RPMs will minimize the impacts of direct effects on the water quality of the streams (Most notably RPMs 27 and 28, see Chapter 2). Best management practices (BMPs) have also been identified for the project and are listed in Appendix C. Road maintenance and addressing legacy sediment sites identified in Appendix D will also mitigate the impacts of sediment on the water quality of streams. One notable exception where RPMs, BMPs, and road maintenance and repair are judged to be inadequate to protect water quality against the direct effects of sediment is Forest Road 31N49. This road is about three miles long and is located in Natural Bridge subwatershed (HUC 6). The road lies within the streambed of Carrier Gulch for much of its length. This road is a former jeep trail that was not designed to Forest Service standards, and cannot be upgraded to comply with the standards. Therefore, no treatments are proposed on this road and the portion of this road on National Forest System lands will be closed under all action alternatives. Indirect Effects Proposed project activities that cause soil compaction and erosion may result in the indirect effect of increased sediment in streams. This indirect effect can be mitigated somewhat by the project BMPs and RPMs. Organic litter in upland areas and Riparian Reserves can reduce erosion, trap sediment and prevent it from moving downhill to surface waters. Large woody debris in Riparian Reserves can trap and retain sediment moving in stream channels, and prevent it from accumulating downstream. The total amount of sediment produced by the Proposed Action that will eventually enter surface water bodies has been estimated for each hydrologic unit. The results for fifth-field (HUC 5) watersheds are presented in Table 3-57, and the results for all hydrologic units are presented in Tables 27 through 35 of the Physical Sciences Report. The estimated total amount of sediment that will enter streams in all the affected watersheds is about 4,000 tons, or about 0.003 tons per acre. For comparison, the background rate of sedimentation for just the South Fork Trinity River subbasin averaged about 1.6 tons per acre per year over the period 1944 to1990 (US EPA, 1998). Indirect effects of the Proposed Action may also include an increase in stream temperatures. Increased sediment can result in channel widening and decreased water depths, which can result in temperature increases. However, increased amounts of large woody debris in streams should result in increased pool depths, which will result in reduced stream temperatures. Estimated required widths of unmanaged near-stream vegetation in forested watersheds needed to maintain water temperature is about 150 feet (USDA Forest Service, 2007). By implementing the project BMPs and RPMs, increases in stream temperatures should be negligible. Cumulative Effects Cumulative effects have been analyzed for the Proposed Action for each watershed, subwatershed, drainage, and sub-drainage in the project area. All of the results are presented in Tables 36 through 44 of the Physical Sciences Report. Although a change in the risk ratio of a few percent relative to the baseline condition is common (especially for HUC 7s and 8s) these changes are considered to be fairly negligible. Only the changes that have caused a change in the risk description (e.g. moderate in the baseline CWE and high in the Proposed Action CWE) are specifically addressed in the text. HUCs that are over the TOC (very high risk) are discussed in more detail. Table 3-57. Indirect effects of each alternative on sediment in all 5th-field watersheds.

There are negligible differences for the subwatersheds as well, with the exception of Grassy Flat-Miners Creek which is still moderate in 2020 instead of low. For the drainages (HUC7s), there are no large differences between the baseline and the Proposed Action. The disturbance level of one hydrologic unit (1801021204010504 in Lower Salt Creek-Hayfork Creek) is high in 2016, but its disturbance level is reduced to moderate by 2018. Table 3-58. Cumulative effects for the Proposed Action in each of the watersheds. Watershed  Risk Ratio by Year  Disturbance Level  2016  2018  2020  Browns Creek  0.44  0.43  0.41  Moderate  Burnt Ranch  0.47  0.49  0.48  Moderate  Canyon Creek  0.25  0.26  0.26  Low  Lower Hayfork Creek  0.42  0.40  0.39  Moderate to Low  Lower South Fork Trinity River  0.56  0.54  0.52  Moderate  Middle South Fork Trinity River  0.60  0.68  0.69  Moderate  New River  0.33  0.34  0.32  Low  Upper Hayfork Creek  0.35  0.33  0.30  Low  Upper South Fork Trinity River  0.24  0.26  0.26  Low  Lower South Fork Trinity River The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects for the Proposed Action in the Lower South Fork Trinity River watershed (Table 3-58) is similar to the baseline condition (Table 3-56) (the disturbance level is moderate throughout the analysis period for each). For Eltapom Creek subwatershed, the disturbance level is moderate throughout the analysis period. Hyampom subwatershed (HUC 6) is over the TOC; therefore, mitigation is required if the Proposed Action is implemented. Hyampom is a planning watershed, and watersheds that are over TOC, regardless of ownership, are not to be further impacted unless they can be improved with appropriate mitigation measures (Forest Plan, page 4-25). To improve Hyampom, it is necessary to reduce the risk ratio (through mitigation) more than the Proposed Action increases the risk ratio. Therefore, mechanized piling and burning is replaced with hand piling and burning in Hyampom, and salvage logging of the unburned to low severity burned areas in Hyampom is removed from the Proposed Action; thereby reducing the required mitigation to the equivalent of about 22 miles of hydrologic restoration of roads. No open system roads will be decommissioned. With these described modifications, the mitigation opportunities for Hyampom identified in the Sediment Source Inventory Report (Appendix D) are more than sufficient to implement the Proposed Action. Three of the five drainages (HUC7s) in Hyampom have very high disturbance levels (Big Creek-Hyampom, Hyampom Valley and Pelletreau Creek), while two do not (Big Slide Creek-South Fork Trinity River and Grapevine Creek-South Fork Trinity River). Middle South Fork Trinity River The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects for the Proposed Action in the Middle South Fork Trinity River watershed (Table 3-58) is similar to the baseline condition (Table 3-56) (the disturbance level is moderate throughout the analysis period for each). For Cave Creek-Miller Springs and Rattlesnake Creek-Post Mountain subwatersheds, the risk of cumulative effects is moderate throughout the analysis period. Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat subwatershed is over the TOC; therefore, mitigation is required if the Proposed Action is implemented. Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat is a planning watershed, and watersheds that are over TOC, regardless of ownership, are not to be further impacted unless they can be improved with appropriate mitigation measures (Forest Plan, page 4-25). Mechanized piling and burning is replaced with hand piling and burning in Sulphur Glade-Waldorf Flat, and salvage logging of the unburned to low severity burned areas in in this subwatershed is removed from the Proposed Action. Also, it is estimated that hydrologic restoration of about three miles of road (or an equivalent amount of some other type of improvement project) in Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat is required. About 3.2 miles of non-system roads identified in the Sediment Source Inventory Report (Appendix D) will be hydrologically restored to comply with the Forest Plan mitigation requirement. Only one of the two HUC7s in Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat have a very high disturbance level (Hitchcock Creek-Oak Flat); making it beneficial to focus mitigation work in Hitchcock Creek-Oak Flat. About 1.4 miles of the unauthorized roads proposed for hydrologic restoration are in Hitchcock Creek-Oak Flat). One sub-drainage (HUC8) within Cave Creek-Swift Creek (1801021202020101) has a very high disturbance level for the duration of the analysis period if the Proposed Action is implemented; making it beneficial to focus mitigation work in the Cave Creek-Swift Creek sub-drainage. (Appendix D). Upper Hayfork Creek The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects for the Proposed Action in the Upper Hayfork Creek watershed (Table 3-58) is similar to the baseline condition (Table 3-56) (the disturbance level of cumulative effects throughout the analysis period is low for each). There are negligible differences for each of the sub-watersheds (HUC6s) as well. For the drainages (HUC7s), there are no large differences between the baseline and the Proposed Action. There are no drainages or sub-drainages for which the disturbance level is considered high or very high at any time during the analysis period. Upper South Fork Trinity River The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects for the Proposed Action in the Upper South Fork Trinity River watershed (Table 3-58) is similar to the baseline condition (Table 3-56) for all hydrologic units. There are no hydrologic units for which the disturbance level is high or very high at any time during the analysis period. Trinity River Browns Creek The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects for the Proposed Action in Browns Creek (Table 3-58) is similar to the baseline condition (Table 3-56) for all hydrologic units. There are no hydrologic units over the TOC, and there are no hydrologic units for which the disturbance level of cumulative effects is high or very high at any time during the analysis period. Burnt Ranch The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects for the Proposed Action in the Burnt Ranch watershed (Table 3-58) is similar to the baseline condition (Table 3-56) for most hydrologic units. For one sub-drainage (1801021111030304) in Lower Big French Creek, the disturbance level increases to moderate if the Proposed Action is implemented. There are no watersheds or sub-watersheds over the TOC, and there are no hydrologic units for which the disturbance level is considered high or very high at any time during the analysis period. Canyon Creek The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects for the Proposed Action in the Canyon Creek watershed (Table 3-58) is similar to the baseline condition (Table 3-56) for all hydrologic units. Neither Canyon Creek nor Lower Canyon Creek are over the TOC, and there are no hydrologic units for which the disturbance level is high or very high at any time during the analysis period. New River The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects for the Proposed Action (Table 3-58) is similar to the baseline condition (Table 3-56) for the New River watershed and its’ subwatersheds and drainages. The disturbance levels in three subdrainages (HUC8s) increase from low to moderate (1801021110060201 in Lower Big Creek-New River, 1801021110060102 in Upper Big Creek-New River, and 1801021110070303 in Bell Creek). Neither the New River watershed nor any of its sub-watersheds are over the TOC. There are two sub-drainages (1801021110040203 in Barron Creek-Carraway Creek and 1801021110040102 in Quinby Creek) for which the disturbance level is high in 2016, but disturbance levels in both drainages naturally recover to moderate by 2018. Alternative 2 Direct Effects The direct effects of Alternative 2 on temperature and sediment are expected to be similar to the Proposed Action (the number of road miles and road/stream crossings are the same). Direct effects should be negligible to minimal as long as the BMPs and RPMs are implemented. Indirect Effects The estimated total amount of sediment that will enter streams in all the watersheds combined is similar for Alternative 2 compared to the Proposed Action (about 4,000 tons or about 0.003 tons per acre). Lower South Fork Trinity will increase to about 800 tons of sediment (about 500 tons for the Proposed Action) (See Physical Sciences Report). Sediment in Middle South Fork Trinity will increase from about 500 to 600 tons. Sediment entering streams in Burnt Ranch will increase from about 200 tons to about 400 tons. Sediment entering the streams in Upper Hayfork Creek will be reduced to about 600 tons (700 tons in the Proposed Action) due to a decreased footprint. Indirect effects for the other watersheds will be about the same as the Proposed Action. Cumulative Effects The risk of cumulative watershed effects for Alternative 2 is similar to the Proposed Action for most hydrologic units. For Browns Creek, Burnt Ranch, Canyon Creek, Lower Hayfork Creek, New River, Upper Hayfork Creek and Upper South Fork Trinity River, there are no watersheds or sub-watersheds over the TOC or at high risk. In Lower South Fork Trinity River, Hyampom subwatershed is over the TOC; therefore, mitigation would be required if Alternative 2 is implemented. Mechanized piling and burning will be replaced with hand piling and burning in Hyampom, and salvage logging of the unburned to low severity burned areas in Hyampom will be removed from Alternative 2. With these resource protection measures, the required mitigation will be reduced to hydrologic restoration on about 30 miles of road. No open system roads would be decommissioned. Mitigation opportunities for Hyampom are identified in the Sediment Source Inventory Report (Appendix D). The HUC7s and HUC8s that are over the TOC for Alternative 2, are also over for the Proposed Action. In Middle South Fork Trinity River, Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat subwatershed is over the TOC; therefore, mechanized piling and burning is replaced with hand piling and burning in Sulphur Glade-Waldorf Flat, and salvage logging of the unburned to low severity burned areas in in this subwatershed is removed from Alternative 2. Also, it is estimated that hydrologic restoration of about 6 miles of road decommissioning will be required for mitigation. Mitigation opportunities for Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat are identified in the Sediment Source Inventory Report (Appendix D). Like the Proposed Action, Hitchcock Creek-Oak Flat drainage and its sub-drainages are at very high disturbance levels. Alternative 3 Direct Effects The direct effects of Alternative 3 on temperature and sediment are expected to be similar to the Proposed Action as long as the BMPs and RPMs are implemented. Indirect Effects The estimated total amount of sediment that will enter streams in all the watersheds combined is about 6,000 tons (about 0.005 tons per acre) for Alternative 3 (compared to about 4,000 tons for the Proposed Action). This increase in the amount of sediment is due to the increased footprint. Sediment entering streams in the Lower Hayfork Creek watershed will increase to about 1000 tons (600 tons in the Proposed Action) (See Physical Sciences Report). Lower South Fork Trinity watershed will increase to about 900 tons of sediment (about 500 tons for the Proposed Action). Sediment in the Middle South Fork Trinity watershed will increase from about 500 to 1000 tons. Sediment entering the streams in the Upper Hayfork Creek watershed will increase to about 1000 tons (700 tons in the Proposed Action). Sediment in streams of the Upper South Fork Trinity River watershed will increase from about 30 tons to 50 tons. Sediment entering streams in the Browns Creek watershed will increase from about 100 tons to about 200 tons. Sediment entering streams in the Burnt Ranch watershed will increase from about 200 tons to about 300 tons. Sediment in the Canyon Creek watershed will increase to about 20 tons from 10 tons. Sediment in streams of the New River watershed will increase from about 1000 tons to 2000 tons. Cumulative Effects The risk of cumulative watershed effects for Alternative 3 is similar to the Proposed Action for most hydrologic units. For Browns Creek, Burnt Ranch, Canyon Creek, and Upper South Fork Trinity River, there are no watersheds or sub-watersheds over the TOC or at high risk. In the Lower Hayfork Creek watershed, the disturbance level for one sub-drainage of Olsen Creek (1801021204050405) is high, instead of moderate like in the Proposed Action. In the New River watershed, the disturbance level for a sub-drainage of Barron Creek-Carroway Creek (1801021110040203) is still high in 2020, instead of reducing to moderate like in the Proposed Action. For Middle South Fork Trinity River, two additional sub-drainages of Cave Creek-Swift Creek (1801021202020105 and 1801021202020106) have very high disturbance levels in 2018. For Upper Hayfork Creek, a sub-drainage of Halls City Creek-Wilson Creek (1801021203010403) also has a very high disturbance level in 2018; however not for the Proposed Action. In Lower South Fork Trinity River, Hyampom subwatershed is over the TOC; therefore, mitigation would be required if Alternative 3 is implemented. Mechanized piling and burning will be replaced with hand piling and burning in Hyampom, and salvage logging of the unburned to low severity burned areas in Hyampom will be removed from Alternative 3. With these resource protection measures, the required mitigation will be reduced to hydrologic restoration of about 41 miles of road.  No open system roads would be decommissioned. Mitigation opportunities for Hyampom are identified in the Sediment Source Inventory Report (Appendix D). The drainages (HUC7) and sub-drainages (HUC8) that have very high disturbance levels for this alternative are also very high in the Proposed Action. In Middle South Fork Trinity River, Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat subwatershed is over the TOC; therefore, mitigation would be required if Alternative 3 is implemented. Mechanized piling and burning is replaced with hand piling and burning in Sulphur Glade-Waldorf Flat, and salvage logging of the unburned to low severity burned areas in in this subwatershed is removed from Alternative 3. Also, it is estimated that hydrologic restoration of about three miles of road would be required for mitigation. Like the Proposed Action, Hitchcock Creek-Oak Flat drainage and its sub-drainages all have very high disturbance levels. Alternative 4 Direct Effects The direct effects of Alternative 4 on temperature and sediment are expected to be similar to the Proposed Action with the BMPs and RPMs. Indirect Effects The estimated total amount of sediment that will enter streams in all the watersheds combined is about 2,000 tons (about 0.001 tons per acre) for Alternative 4 (compared to about 4,000 tons for the Proposed Action). Except for Lower Hayfork Creek and New River (See Physical Sciences Report), the estimated total amount of sediment for each watershed will be less than half of that of the Proposed Action. For Upper Hayfork Creek, Burnt Ranch, and Canyon Creek, the estimated amount of sediment will be less than one third of that of the Proposed Action. For Middle South Fork Trinity River and Browns Creek, it will be about one fifth; and for Upper South Fork Trinity River, it will be about one tenth. Cumulative Effects The risk of cumulative watershed effects for Alternative 4 is similar to the Proposed Action for most hydrologic units. For Browns Creek, Burnt Ranch, Canyon Creek, Lower Hayfork Creek, New River, Upper Hayfork Creek and Upper South Fork Trinity River, there are no watersheds or sub-watersheds over the TOC or at a high disturbance level. In Lower South Fork Trinity River, Hyampom subwatershed is over the TOC; therefore, mitigation would be required if Alternative 4 is implemented. Mechanized piling and burning will be replaced with hand piling and burning in Hyampom, and salvage logging of the unburned to low severity burned areas in Hyampom will be removed from Alternative 4. With these resource protection measures, the required mitigation will be reduced to about 8 miles of hydrologic restoration. No open system roads would be decommissioned.  Mitigation opportunities for Hyampom are identified in the Sediment Source Inventory Report (Appendix D). The drainages (HUC7) and sub-drainages (HUC8) that have very high disturbance levels for this alternative are also very high for the Proposed Action. In Middle South Fork Trinity River, Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat subwatershed is over the TOC; therefore, mitigation would be required if Alternative 4 is implemented. Mechanized piling and burning is replaced with hand piling and burning in Sulphur Glade-Waldorf Flat, and salvage logging of the unburned to low severity burned areas in in this subwatershed is removed from the Alternative 4. Also, it is estimated that hydrologic restoration of about 1 mile of road would be required. Mitigation opportunities for Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat are identified in the Sediment Source Inventory Report (Appendix D). Like the Proposed Action, Hitchcock Creek-Oak Flat drainage and its sub-drainages are at very high disturbance levels. Alternative 5 Direct Effects The direct effects of Alternative 5 on temperature and sediment are expected to be similar to the Proposed Action with the BMPs and RPMs. Indirect Effects The estimated total amount of sediment that will enter streams in all the watersheds combined is about 400 (about 0.0003 tons per acre) for Alternative 5 (compared to about 4,000 tons for the Proposed Action). For Lower Hayfork Creek (See Physical Sciences Report), the estimated total amount of sediment will be one sixth of that of the Proposed Action. For Burnt Ranch, the estimated amount of sediment is 15% of that of the Proposed Action. For Upper Hayfork Creek, Canyon Creek, and New River, the estimated amount of sediment will be one tenth of that of the Proposed Action. For Lower South Fork Trinity River, Middle South Fork Trinity River, Upper South Fork Trinity River, and Browns Creek, the total estimated sediment will be less than 10% of that of the Proposed Action. Cumulative Effects The risk of cumulative watershed effects for Alternative 5 is similar to the Proposed Action for most hydrologic units. For Browns Creek, Burnt Ranch, Canyon Creek, Lower Hayfork Creek, New River, Upper Hayfork Creek and Upper South Fork Trinity River, there are no watersheds or sub-watersheds over the TOC or at a high disturbance level. In Hyampom and Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat sub-watersheds, there are no activities proposed for this alternative, so mitigation will not be required. Alternative 6 (No Action) Direct Effects There are no direct effects associated with the No Action Alternative. Indirect Effects If no action is taken by the Forest Service, then the increases in sediment delivery to the streams from the Proposed Action (or any of the other action alternatives) will not occur. However, it is anticipated that if the timber is not salvaged by the Forest Service, then at least some of it will be harvested by unauthorized activities. In this event, it is unlikely that RPMs and BMPs will be implemented. Therefore, depending on the extent of any unauthorized logging, it is possible that more sediment could enter the streams than would occur by the timber salvage activities in the Proposed Action. Cumulative Effects If no action is taken, then the cumulative effects for each hydrologic unit will be the same as the baseline conditions described in the Affected Environment section of this report. Any unauthorized logging that may occur has not been modelled because it is not possible to predict where it may occur, or its magnitude. However, unauthorized logging will increase the ERA of the hydrologic units in which it is located. Fish _______________________________________ Introduction This section describes the existing and projected conditions related to potentially affected fish and aquatic ecosystems of the STNF in response to the proposed Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project (Project). Information contained in this section was obtained from various STNF documents including the STNF Land and Resources Management Plan (LRMP; 1995). In furtherance of the objectives contained in the LRMP, the Proposed Action in particular has been designed to accommodate many aspects and goals that are described in detail in the Project DEIS, the Project Forest Vegetation Report (2016), and other Project reports. The following Watershed Analyses cover Project lands and were consulted: Trinity River • Mainstem Trinity River Watershed Analysis (USDA STNF 1995) • Upper Trinity River Watershed Analysis (USDA STNF 2005) Canyon Creek • North Fork Trinity River, East Fork North Fork Trinity River, and Canyon Creek Watershed Assessment (USDA STNF 2003) New River • New River Watershed Assessment (USDA STNF 2000) Burnt Ranch Creek • Watershed Analysis Burnt Ranch and Soldier Creek Planning Watersheds (STNF 2009) Upper South Fork Trinity River • Upper South Fork Trinity River-Happy Camp Creek Watershed Analysis (STNF 1999) Middle South Fork Trinity River • Hidden Valley, Plummer Creek and Rattlesnake Creek Watershed Assessment (USDA STNF 2001) Upper Hayfork Creek • Upper Hayfork Creek Watershed Assessment (USDA STNF 1998) • Middle Hayfork and Salt Creek Watershed Assessment (USDA STNF 2000) Lower Hayfork Creek • Lower Hayfork Creek Watershed Assessment (USDA STNF 1996) • Middle Hayfork and Salt Creek Watershed Assessment (USDA STNF 2000) Affected Species and Presence of Critical Habitat — the following anadromous salmonids, anadromous Pacific lamprey, and resident salmonids and their habitats that occur within the fifth field watersheds of the Project have special status under the ESA or are given special management consideration as Forest Service Sensitive or Management Indicator Species, or have Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) designation: Endangered: • None Threatened: • Southern Oregon Northern California Coasts (SONCC) Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and their designated Critical Habitat (CH) Proposed: • None USFS Sensitive: • Upper Klamath-Trinity (UKT) Rivers Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha); Klamath Mountains Province (KMP) steelhead trout (O. mykiss); and Pacific Lamprey (Entosphenos tridentatus) Essential Fish Habitat: • Coho salmon and Chinook salmon USFS Mgt. Indicator Species: • Spring-run Chinook salmon, spring-run (summer) steelhead -South Fork Trinity only; resident rainbow trout. See the life histories of these fishes in Appendix E of the document labeled “Fish BE and MIS report.” Aquatic resources are an emphasis on the STNF via the LRMP (1995); for example, page 4-25, 18.f: “Identify and treat areas with a degraded watershed condition in a cost-effective manner and according to beneficial use priorities. High priority items include domestic use, anadromous fish habitat, and sensitive species habitat”. These priorities are duplicated for the Trinity River watershed via the multi-decadal US Bureau of Reclamation-funded Trinity River Restoration Program of which the STNF is an active participant in, and a member of, the Trinity Management Council. Riparian Reserves, critical for proper aquatic habitat function and management and as defined by the Northwest Forest Plan ROD (USDA, USDI 1994), receive strong protection from potential Project impacts. Riparian Reserves on the STNF are scheduled to receive some of the proposed or alternative actions by which adverse impacts to aquatic resources could feasibly be delivered. Riparian Reserves were established in each watershed within and around areas that are directly coupled to streams or rivers. The reserves generally parallel the stream network and were established to maintain hydrologic, geomorphic, and ecologic processes and include other areas necessary for maintaining these processes. The widths of the reserves are as wide as two site-potential trees in height on each side of fish-bearing streams. Widths decrease for smaller or non-fish-bearing streams. The reserves are managed under special Standards and Guidelines that prohibit and/or regulate forest management activities that would otherwise retard or prevent attainment of Aquatic Conservation Strategy objectives (LRMP 1995; Northwest Forest Plan 1994). The reserves are a key element designed to maintain and restore riparian structure and function and promote desirable water temperatures connectivity corridors for wildlife. Fuels reduction activities and removal of fire-killed hazard trees in excess of large woody debris (LWD) quantity needs will contribute to the health of riparian reserves by reducing severe or intense fires in and near riparian reserves that could otherwise adversely affect aquatic systems. Based on the Project DEIS, 2016: Figure 3-11 illustrates the specific fire complex locations described above, and includes past management on the STNF within the same areas. (Figure obtained from the Project’s Forest Vegetation Report, 2016). Table 3-59 lists the ten 5th field watersheds encompassed by the fire footprints, the specific HUC for each, and the acreage of each watershed. See the Project fish biological assessment to view a table illustrating burn severities at the Project Analysis area scale. Actions Common to All Five Action Alternatives The primary means by which alternatives differ include levels of fuel reduction treatments prescribed, how to treat (or not treat) felled trees, and the criteria used for identification of hazard trees. From the Project Forest Vegetation Report, 2016: • Treatments in areas identified for fuels reduction treatment types for both initial entry and maintenance could include: Mechanical or hand felling and removal of hazard trees utilizing ground or cable logging systems. Hazard trees felled outside of the 300 foot buffer would be left on site. • Reduction of fuel loading to 10-20 tons/acre including dead trees and brush. Dead brush will be reduced by 50-100%. Dead vegetation will be identified at the time of treatment. o Hand felling, which cuts down trees and/or brush using hand tools such as a chainsaw. o Mastication, which pulverizes or chops standing trees and logs into small particles. This treatment can include mowing, mulching, or chipping. o Lopping woody debris (slash) and scattering around the treated area, which redistributes woody material. o Pruning which removes lower limbs up to 10 feet from the ground. o Hand piling slash which concentrates slash and surface fuels in small piles. Machine piling slash which utilizes equipment to pile slash and surface fuels into larger piles. Pile burning, which is the prescribed ignition of created piles. o Jackpot burning, which is a burning method used to reduce heavy intermittent fuel concentrations, where fuels are not continuous enough to carry a broadcast fire. o Broadcast burning, which is a burning method used where heavy continuous fuel concentrations exist. o Chipping. This pulverizes or chops trees, brush, and logs into small particles, redistributing surface fuels. • Utilize wood products whenever possible. This can include salvage logs, commercial or personal use firewood, biomass removal, etc. After the initial entry, vegetation will continue to grow, and trees will continue to succumb to fire damage and subsequent insect and disease and fall to the ground. These processes contribute to increasing fuel loading along roads once the initial Project implementation is complete. In order to sustain the desired condition as it relates to hazard mitigation, follow-up treatments may be necessary to maintain fuel loading levels between 10-20 tons/acre. Conditions will be evaluated and prescribed 10-15 years following implementation. Another interrelated or connected action required during implementation of any of the alternatives is addressing up to 11 so-called legacy road/stream crossing sites that have been deemed problem locations by STNF internal Sediment Source Inventories (2016, 2012, and 2011) and reported to the North Coast Water Quality Control Board. Generally, the crossing sites are culverts determined to be inadequately sized to successfully pass stream discharges expected during larger storms such as a 100 year return interval storm event. A road/stream crossing ford that currently passes vehicles directly across a flowing stream must also be ameliorated. See further discussion about this specific activity under the description of ‘Project elements’, particularly Project element 5, under the Project Description heading. Figure 3-11 Past Forest Management Activities within the 2015 Wildfire Footprints, Shasta-Trinity National Forest93 93 See this project’s Forest Vegetation Report, Figure 1, for a higher resolution image Table 3-59.

View Figure 3-11 and the many tables in Appendix D, particularly Tables D-3, D-6, D-12, D-13, D-16, and D-20 to glean the specific sites from which the restoration activities described above will originate. As per the STNF LRMP, page 4-25, 1995, and reiterated in the Project Fish BA and Physical Sciences Report (2016; note: TOC means threshold of concern): “Watersheds that are over TOC, regardless of ownership, will not be further impacted unless they can be improved with appropriate mitigation measures”. Hyampom and Sulphur Glade-Waldorf Flat subwatersheds are over the TOC and lie within the Project action area. Decommissioning non-system (U) roads and upgrading Forest Service system roads have been included in the action alternatives to serve as Cumulative Watershed Effects (CWE) TOC mitigation measures. Descriptions of Alternatives The five action alternatives are entitled as follows: • Alternative 1-Proposed Action • Alternative 2-Consistent Buffer and Fuelbreaks • Alternative 3-Wide Buffer • Alternative 4-Northern Spotted Owl • Alternative 5-Minimum Impact Please refer to the Project DEIS and Project Forest Vegetation Report in particular for detailed descriptions of the five action alternatives and the no action alternative. See the section “Actions Common to all Alternatives” above for additional details and a discussion of the CWE TOC and legacy restoration treatments scheduled. Table 3-60.

In Alternative 5, PE3 -commercial salvage via timber harvest and construction of fuelbreaks -will not occur. The proposed and the other action alternatives include six Project Elements (PEs). • PE 1 -Hazard Tree Mitigation and Reforestation • PE 2 -Fuels Reduction Initial Entry • PE 3 -Commercial Salvage • PE 4 – Routine Road Preparation and Maintenance. Temporary Road Ramps, Landings, and Water Drafting • PE 5 -Legacy Site Treatments, Stream Crossing Reconstruction, and Road Decommissioning • PE 6 -Fuels Reduction Maintenance Note: the first four PEs above and PE6 comprise PE 1 in the Project fish BA – ‘Roadside Vegetation Management.’ PE5 corresponds to PE 2 in the Project Fish BA – ‘Road Management and Legacy Sediment Source Reduction’. PE 1 -Hazard Tree Mitigation and Reforestation The need to conduct this activity is described in the Project Forest Vegetation Report (2016): “Roadside Safety Hazards-Trees killed by fire possess reduced structural integrity and are likely to fail. Fire-killed trees of all age classes continue to fall along roads, threatening human safety, road and trail access, and culvert efficacy. Within and along the perimeters of the 2015 wildfires, 233 miles of open (maintenance level 2, 3 and 4) National Forest Transportation System (NFTS) roads as well as state highways and county roads had a mosaic of very low to high intensity fires burn along them. The open NFTS roads which bisect conifer stands that experienced moderate to high severity wildfire have resulted in a considerable hazard to users particularly in areas with steep topography. Dead trees fall to the ground, with the potential to fall into the road or roll down toward open roads, resulting in heighted risk to public health and safety”. See a list of road segment vegetation treatment mileages and acres in Table 1 of the Project fish BA. Reforestation is also an important component of this phase of the action alternatives and would generally be conducted as such: “Reforestation would occur within the road buffer in areas salvaged as well as other historically forested areas that experienced moderate to high burn severity, thereby largely losing the overstory (i.e. sources of natural seed). Reforestation would entail the planting of tree species historically present in each stand. Tree species would include a mixture of Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, incense cedar, sugar pine and red fir (South Fork Mountain only). Reforestation spacing could vary between 18-feet by18-feet to 30-feet by 30-feet depending on site condition, terrain and existing vegetation. Within five years after planting, there is an expected mortality rate of approximately 30%, which may vary depending on weather/drought conditions and site. Live planted seedlings would be manually released (removal of competing vegetation by hand, not chemically) approximately 3 years following planting.” (Project Forest Vegetation Report, 2016). Approximately 11 MMBF of hazard trees may become salvage logs. PE 2 -Fuels Reduction – Initial Entry The criteria, techniques and goals of initial entry fuels reduction are listed below (Project Forest Vegetation Report 2016): “Treatments in areas identified for fuels reduction treatment types for…initial entry….could include: • Mechanical or hand felling and removal of hazard trees utilizing ground or cable logging systems. Hazard trees felled outside of the 300 foot buffer would be left on site. • Reduction of fuel loading to 10-20 tons/acre including dead trees and brush. Dead brush will be reduced by 50-100%. Dead vegetation will be identified at the time of treatment. o Hand felling, which cuts down trees and/or brush using hand tools such as a chainsaw. o Mastication, which pulverizes or chops standing trees and logs into small particles. This treatment can include mowing, mulching, or chipping. o Lopping woody debris (slash) and scattering around the treated area, which redistributes woody material. o Pruning which removes lower limbs up to 10 feet from the ground. o Hand piling slash which concentrates slash and surface fuels in small piles. o Machine piling slash which utilizes equipment to pile slash and surface fuels into larger piles. o Pile burning which is the prescribed ignition of created piles. o Jackpot burning, which is a burning method used to reduce heavy intermittent fuel concentrations, where fuels are not continuous enough to carry a broadcast fire. o Broadcast burning, which is a burning method used where heavy continuous fuel concentrations exist. o Chipping, which pulverizes or chops trees, brush, and logs into small particles, redistributing the surface fuels”. PE 3 -Commercial Salvage Commercial timber sales (saw logs) are expected to be economically feasible along approximately 128 segmented miles of the 233 miles of roads on approximately 4,100 acres in alternative 1; 5,340 acres of alternative 2; 7,684 acres in alternative 3; and 782 acres of alternative 4. Additional sales could be considered outside of these miles, but the expected volume is less outside of the acres listed for each alternative. Commercial sale of firewood is also an outcome of such salvage. Fire-killed trees lose all commercial value within three years (Project Forest Vegetation Report 2016); ideally, capture of such wood is best if done within one year of the fire. PE 4 – Routine Road Preparation and Maintenance, Temporary Road Ramps, Landings, and Water Drafting Routine road work will be required for at least the 233 miles of roads specifically involved with any of the Project alternatives. Installation of drainage dips and grading are specific examples. Access ramps would be less than 100-feet in length and may be utilized to access existing or newly constructed landings. Ramps will be decommissioned following use (Project DEIS 2016). Use of existing landings will be emphasized. Up to 60 new temporary landings will be constructed to store dead tree-cut logs for commercial salvage along 128 miles of roads. Existing landings within Riparian Reserves can be reused; however, the surface area of disturbance will not be increased and these features will be tilled and seeded following use where they do not need to be retained as part of the road system. No new landings will be constructed within the Riparian Reserve. No existing landings within equipment exclusion zones (EEZs) will be used unless they are connected to a system road. Road pullouts are sometimes used as landings. Wide areas along roads that are used as landings are often also used as turnouts for vehicle traffic and are considered part of the road system. Where these occur within Riparian Reserves, they will be retained. Landing surfaces will be tilled and made porous to precipitation when the Project is completed. Water drafting will occur under the following direction of resource protection measure language, guided in part by the Forest LRMP (1995, page 4-25). Water drafting will: a) occur at existing sites with existing access; b) minimize adverse effects on stream channel stability and instream flows needed to maintain riparian resources; c) minimize sedimentation; d) minimize impacts to fish habitat; and e) utilize a fish screen to prevent fish entrapment. No new water drafting sites will be developed. Water drafting sites that are not within habitat that is accessible to anadromous salmonids will be identified first and will be given priority for use. See a map of the drafting sites in the Project Fish BA, Appendix A. When needed, water drafting may occur in habitat accessible by anadromous salmonids. In all cases where water drafting occurs within anadromous salmonid habitat, 2001 National Marine Fisheries Service’s (NMFS) Water Drafting Specifications will be adhered to (see Appendix D of the Project Fish BE and MIS Report). Any new drafting sites will be approved by a Forest Service fish biologist and/or hydrologist prior to use. In addition, when drafting water the following rules apply. From the STNF LRMP (1995): a) Allow drafting from fishery streams only where immediate downstream discharge is maintained at 1.5 cubic feet per second (CFS) or greater. b) Allow drafting from ephemeral streams, intermittent streams, wetlands or constructed ponds provided that sufficient water quantity and quality remains to support associated wildlife species and riparian values. c) Never allow drafting to remove more than 50 percent of any stream discharge or 75 percent of constructed pond water. A detailed discussion about how water drafting can adversely affect salmonids (and/or lamprey) is found under the ‘Effects’ section in the Project fish BA, 2016. PE 5 -Legacy Site Treatments, Stream Crossing Reconstruction, and Road Decommissioning Sediment Source Inventory (SSI) reports from 2016, 2012, and 2011 were used to compile the potential restoration sites. From the most recent SSI (2016): “The Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements for Nonpoint Source Discharges Related to Certain Federal Land Management Activities on NFS Lands in the North Coast Region (“Waiver”) addresses nonpoint source discharges of waste to waters of California from activities associated with specific uses of NFS lands (Cal. EPA North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board. 2015). The Waiver requires that all legacy sediment sites for this project must be identified, inventoried, prioritized, scheduled and implemented for treatment as a part of the project activities. The inventory is required to be submitted to the Regional Water Board during project development. This report will be submitted to the Regional Water Board to comply with this requirement. The Waiver acknowledges that some projects may be so large that it is infeasible or unnecessary to treat all legacy sediment sites. In such cases, alternative legacy sediment site treatment plans that inventory and propose to treat some portion of the largest sediment producing sites within the project area may be submitted to the Executive Officer of the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board (Water Board) for approval. The Water Board has agreed that an alternative legacy sediment site treatment plan is appropriate for this project (Maggie Robinson, Water Board Engineering Geologist, written communication). Therefore, the Forest Service proposes to treat only the high and moderate-high risk features within the project area, and the high risk features along the haul routes. These treatments, along with descriptions of past legacy sediment site treatments and restoration efforts implemented in the same subwatersheds (HUC 6) within the past twenty years will be submitted to the Water Board as part of an alternative legacy sediment site treatment plan. Watersheds that are over the threshold of concern (TOC) are not to be further impacted unless they can be improved with appropriate mitigation measures (STNF LRMP, page 4-25). Hyampom and Sulphur Glade-Waldorf Flat subwatersheds are over TOC. Decommissioning Forest Service system roads, restoring non-system roads, and upgrading system roads are common mitigation measures. Non-system roads in Hyampom and Sulphur Glade-Waldorf Flat that have been identified for restoration to comply with the mitigation requirement for this project are identified in this report. Closed roads in Hyampom that have been identified for decommissioning or improvement are identified in this report. Road reconstruction will occur as necessary to comply with the Waiver and Forest Plan mitigation requirements. Actions can include surface improvement; construction of drainage dips, culverts, riprap fills or other drainage or stabilization features with potential disturbance outside the established roadway (toe of fill to top of cut); and realignment”. Concerning primarily the latter requirement, the decommissioning of approximately five miles of roads may also be required. Stream crossing culvert removal will also occur on 21 additional miles of selected roads regardless of the number of existing culverts that may exist on them. Road quality upgrading and reconstruction will occur over 247 total miles of road as well to reduce total sediment yields from them compared to pre-treatment. Road reconstruction will occur as necessary to comply with the Waiver and Forest Plan mitigation requirements. Actions can include surface improvement; construction of drainage dips, culverts, riprap fills or other drainage or stabilization features with potential disturbance required outside of the established roadway (from toe of fill to top of cut); and realignment. See Table 3-60 for a listing of the specific stream crossing locations and other characteristics of each site. View Figure 3-11 and the many tables in Appendix D, particularly Tables D-3, D-6, D-12, D-13, D-16, and D-20 to glean the specific sites from which the restoration activities described above will originate. See the stream crossing and other road-related condition summaries found in the Project fish BA reviewed on a HUC 5 basis under the Proposed Action section. See also the specific road repair and sediment source reduction information for the various Project watersheds found under the description of Project element 2, Road Management and Sediment Source Reduction Projects, in the Project fish BA (2016). PE 6 -Fuels Reduction Maintenance Fuels reduction activities conducted later during maintenance can include all of the specified actions listed above under initial entry fuels reduction. In addition, the following can occur specifically for maintenance after initial entry, starting three years afterwards and depending on the alternative chosen: prescribed burning (broadcast, jackpot, underburn, and piles); felling of hazard trees; hand piling excess fuels, and hand felling of small trees and brush that have grown since Project implementation. Please review Table 1 in the Project Fish BA, ‘Roadside Vegetation Treatment Acres by Watershed’. Applicable Laws, Regulations, and Standards Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management PlanProgrammatic management direction for the STNF is provided by the LRMP (USFS 1995), which incorporates the Record of Decision (ROD) for Amendments to Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management Planning Documents Within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl (Northwest Forest Plan -USDA, USDI 1994). The ROD established the Aquatic Conservation Strategy (ACS), of which Riparian Reserves are a component. Specific direction for management of Riparian Reserves is found in the ACS and in STNF standards and guidelines for this management area. The standards and guidelines are designed to protect the unique functions (such as stream shade, sediment filtering and large wood recruitment to the stream) of near-stream areas and preserve their integrity by not engaging in activities that disturb soil or destabilize slopes within Riparian Reserves. Adoption of the ACS through the ROD and the STNF LRMP sets the framework for significant changes (beginning in 1994) in the way ecosystems are managed, conserved, and restored. Among these changes is the application of focused and prioritized restoration and protection in areas with the highest likelihood of recovery and retention of high quality aquatic habitat. The concept of Key Watersheds is another component of the ACS. Key Watersheds act as refugia for endangered salmonids and other aquatic and riparian-dependent species. Guidelines require watershed analysis (WA) prior to major projects (such as this one) and no net increase in road miles. There are four Tier 1 Key Watersheds within the Project area: Upper South Fork Trinity River (Hayfork Creek to Headwaters); New River (Mouth to Virgin Creek); North Fork Trinity River (Mouth to Headwaters); Canyon Creek (Mouth to Headwaters). Tier 1 Key Watersheds contribute directly to conservation of at-risk anadromous salmonids and have a high potential of being restored as part of a watershed restoration program. The STNF LRMP (1995) includes provisions from the Northwest Forest Plan Record of Decision (USDA, USDI 1994) to protect and improve conditions for aquatic species, including salmon and trout. Implementation of the Record of Decision standards and guidelines were designed to “reverse the trend of degradation and begin recovery of aquatic ecosystems on federal lands within the range of the owl” (ROD, page 46). The Record of Decision also addresses the matter of long-term persistence of late seral and early seral dependent species stating that, “implementation of the ROD fully meets our statutory and regulatory requirements regarding fish and wildlife resources.” Streamside Management Zones -protection of streamside management zones is accomplished through designation of Riparian Reserves and equipment exclusion zones and field verification of specific activities within Riparian Reserves. Clean Water Act of 1972, as Amended Forest management activities must be consistent with the federal Clean Water Act and the California Porter-Cologne Water Quality Act, as addressed in the Water Quality Control Plan for the North Coast Region. This Plan contains water quality standards that include water quality objectives and protection of applicable beneficial uses. As mentioned before, the Trinity River Total Measurable Dissolved Load (TMDL; EPA 2001) for sediment is established in accordance with Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act because the State of California has determined that water quality standards for the Trinity River are exceeded due to excessive sediment. The beneficial uses associated with cold water fish habitat are currently impaired in the Trinity River Basin. Conditions in portions of the Trinity River and its tributaries have degraded and are not adequate to support the beneficial uses. Land management activities have been recognized as potential sources of nonpoint water pollution. By definition, nonpoint pollution is not controllable through conventional treatment plant means. Nonpoint pollution is controlled by containing the pollutant at its source, thereby precluding delivery to surface water. Sections 208 and 319 of the federal Clean Water Act, as amended, acknowledge land treatment measures as being an effective means of controlling nonpoint sources of water pollution and emphasize their development. The most effective means to control nonpoint source pollution is through implementation of best management practices (BMPs; see section below on BMPs and Appendix C), which are defined as “methods, measures, or practices selected by an agency to meet its nonpoint source control needs.” BMPs include, but are not limited to, structural and nonstructural controls, operations, and maintenance procedures. BMPs can be applied before, during, and after pollution-producing activities to reduce or eliminate the introduction of pollutants into receiving waters. BMPs are usually applied as a system of practices rather than as a single practice. BMPs are selected on the basis of site-specific conditions that reflect natural background conditions and political, social, economic, and technical feasibility. BMPs are basically a preventive rather than an enforcement system. BMPs are a whole management and planning system in relation to sound water quality goals, including both broad policy and site-specific prescriptions. Management direction specific to maintaining water quality during Project implementation is contained in Chapter 4 of the STNF LRMP. The BMPs were developed in compliance with Section 208 of the federal Clean Water Act to protect beneficial uses such as water quality and anadromous fish and were certified by the State Water Quality Resources Control Board and approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In 1981 the Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Region (Region 5) first entered into a management agency agreement with the California Water Resources Control Board. The agreement requires the Forest Service to institute a water quality management program to meet applicable water quality objectives and protect beneficial uses in accordance with Regional Basin Plans. The agreement allows the Forest Service to use its state-approved and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-certified BMPs to protect water quality from nonpoint sources of pollution and thereby meet applicable Basin Plan objectives. The agreement also requires the Forest Service to monitor BMP effectiveness in meeting Basin Plan requirements. Specific BMP descriptions and implementation guidance are included in the Region 5 handbook titled, “Water Quality Management for National Forest System Lands in California.” Endangered Species Act of 1973. Management activities must be consistent with the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The STNF LRMP management direction for federally listed species includes conserving Endangered and Threatened species and using forest authority to further the ESA. All Forest Service planned, funded, and executed programs and activities must be reviewed for effects on listed species (USFS 1995). Potential adverse effects of projects must be minimized. The methodological approach chosen to describe the effects of this Project on aquatic resources is the AP, which stands for the “Analytical Process for Developing Biological Assessments for Federal Actions Affecting Fish within the Northwest Forest Plan Area” (USDA et. al 2004). See Appendices A and G in the Project Fish BE and MIS Report for a description of this methodology used to analyze the effects of this Project on fish and aquatic resources and to view the table referenced below. The AP (USDA et al 2004) is used for ESA consultations and provides “Tables of Population and Habitat Indicators for Use in the Northwest Forest Plan Area.” The Table describes the Primary Constituent Elements of critical habitat for coho salmon, as well as the important elements necessary for analysis of habitat for steelhead trout, Chinook salmon, EFH, resident rainbow trout and Pacific Lamprey. The Table provides values and ranges of conditions of indicators to determine whether baseline conditions are “Properly Functioning,” “At Risk,” or “Not Properly Functioning.” The Table is used for project-level analyses, to summarize existing conditions of fish habitat and effects of projects (refer to the Project fish BA, 2016). See Appendices A and G of the Fish BE and MIS report. National Forest Management ActThe effects analysis will include consideration of direct, indirect, and cumulative effects on aquatic species that are considered USDA Forest Service Region 5 Sensitive (USFS 2013) and STNF Management Indicator Species (MIS). The National Forest Management Act (90 Stat. 2949; 16 USC 1600) states “it is the policy of the Congress that all forested lands in the National Forest System be maintained in appropriate forest cover with species of trees, degree of stocking, rate of growth, and conditions of stand designated to secure the maximum benefits of multiple use and sustained yield management in accordance with land management plans.” Magnuson-Stevens Act and Essential Fish Habitat An analysis for EFH is contained in the Project biological assessment for SONCC coho salmon and UKT Chinook salmon. Both of these species are also addressed in this report with reference to EFH. The STNF follows the 2004 and 2001 “Guidance for Integrating Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act EFH Consultations with Endangered Species Act Section 7 Consultations, National Marine Fisheries Service”. EFH provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA) require heightened consideration of fish habitat in resource management decisions wherever applicable. EFH is defined in section 3 of the MSA as “those waters and substrates necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity.” NMFS interprets EFH to include aquatic areas and their associated physical, chemical, and biological properties used by fish that are necessary to support a sustainable fishery and the contribution of the managed species to a healthy ecosystem. The MSA and its implementing regulations at 50 CFR 600.92(j) require that before a federal agency may authorize, fund, or carry out any action that may adversely affect EFH, it must consult with the NMFS. The purpose of the consultation is to develop conservation recommendations that address reasonably foreseeable adverse effects on EFH. Freshwater EFH for Pacific salmonids includes all streams, lakes, ponds, wetlands, and other water bodies currently, or historically, accessible to salmon in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California, except areas upstream of specific impassible manmade barriers and long-standing impassible natural barriers. The definition of EFH is the functional equivalent to Southern Oregon / Northern California Coasts (SONCC) coho salmon critical habitat in the Assessment Area. The STNF uses its distribution information for steelhead trout to identify critical habitat since it is the most complete and ‘conservative’ information relative to estimating the extent of anadromous fish habitat. The effects analysis contained in the Project fish BA and this document consider effects on Pacific salmonid habitat in general, effects on SONCC coho salmon critical habitat, and EFH. Wild and Scenic River Values The mainstem Trinity and South Fork Trinity Rivers are designated Wild and Scenic. Wild and Scenic Rivers shall be preserved in free flowing condition; they and their immediate environment shall be protected for the benefit and enjoyment of future generations. Project activities would not impede free flowing conditions or cause direct and adverse effects on the identified Outstandingly Remarkable values. Considering all cumulative and foreseeable effects, implementation of any of the action alternatives will protect or enhance the Outstandingly Remarkable fisheries and cultural values, particularly in the intermediate to long-term. The outstandingly remarkable value of fisheries will benefit in the intermediate and long-term resulting from the long-term beneficial effects of the proposed action. Aquatic Conservation StrategyThe ACS has 4 key components to help maintain and restore fish populations and their habitat: 1) Riparian Reserves, 2) Key Watersheds, 3) Watershed Analysis, and 4) Watershed Restoration. The STNF in general, and this Project specifically, meet ACS objectives through designation of key watersheds and Riparian Reserves, completing watershed analyses, identifying restoration needs, and funding and implementing restoration projects in the subject watersheds (e.g. road decommissioning). Management Direction contained in the STNF LRMP relative to ACS objectives and fuels projects provides more specific guidance. The Project meets Management Area Goals and Standards and Guidelines. The Project is consistent with the ACS through implementation of fuels reduction projects including within Riparian Reserves, while maintaining existing desired stand characteristics (a diverse age class of healthy conifers along with obligate riparian vegetation) and through enhancing future stand conditions by encouraging survival of suppressed and intermediate trees and promoting growth of conifers already present. These actions would result in a more diverse forest structure, and would enhance potential large wood recruitment to streams. Other management direction includes designing fuels treatments to meet ACS objectives, and to minimize disturbance to ground cover and vegetation in Riparian Reserves. The Project meets this direction through designing treatments in Riparian Reserves that would maintain or restore Riparian Reserve function including desired stand characteristics that provide stream shade, wood recruitment and sediment filtering capacity. Guidance for compliance with the ACS was promulgated in a joint memorandum issued by the Forest Service and the BLM in 2007. That compliance is being followed in this Project analysis. A discussion of Aquatic Conservation Strategy Objectives can also be found in Appendix E of this document. Existing Conditions Background on Environmental Baseline Refer to the Project fish biological assessment (2016) for detailed discussions on existing conditions and the environmental baseline. See Appendix A in the Project Fish BE and MIS Report for a tabular presentation of the criteria by which baseline conditions are assessed. Environmental baseline is defined as: “The past and present impacts of all Federal, state, or private actions and other human activities in an action area, the anticipated impacts of all proposed Federal projects in an action area that have already undergone formal or early section 7 consultation, and the impact of state or private actions that are contemporaneous with the consultation in progress” (50 CFR §402.02, as defined in the Final ESA Section 7 handbook, March 1998). Please refer to Figure 3-12 which lists the specific fifth-field watersheds and the hydrologic unit codes (HUCs) affected by the 2015 fires. The figure also shows the fire area footprints in relation to those variously affected sub-basins of the Trinity and South Fork Trinity Rivers. Figure 3-12 originates in the Project Biological Assessment (2016). Table 3-61 lists all streams within the Project action area that have anadromous or resident fish or fish habitat within 300 feet of Project roads within or near treatment buffers. The Action Area, defined as “all areas to be affected directly or indirectly by the Federal action and not merely the immediate area involved in the action” (ESA Handbook 1998), provides habitat for SONCC coho salmon, listed as Threatened under the ESA, and their designated CH. EFH for coho and Chinook salmon occur within the Action Area, and is considered identical to the distribution of coho salmon CH in this document. Habitat for all of the remaining species listed at the beginning of this document: USFS Sensitive and STNF Management Indicator Species, are all assumed to potentially utilize the same habitat. In reality, coho salmon are not quite able to access all of the physical habitats that USFS Sensitive Klamath Mountain Province (KMP) steelhead can gain access to, but in turn steelhead cannot gain access to all of the habitats that USFS Sensitive Pacific Lamprey can access on some occasions. Finally, resident trout reside in some upper stream reaches that no anadromous species can access. Overall, the water quality in the Trinity River is impaired and is on the 303(d) Clean Water Act list due to fine-grained sediment loading. The South Fork Trinity River is also listed on the 303(d) Clean Water Act list due to temperature impairment, in addition to sediment loading. Despite these official impairment designations, the water released from Lewiston Dam at river mile 112 on the mainstem Trinity River is nearly always ‘crystal clear’ and for the majority of the dry months from March to October, transports very little appreciable sediment nor turbidity for the entire 112 miles to the Klamath River. Elevated temperatures on the South Fork Trinity River have been an issue since the end of the devastating December, 1964 flood. The main channel of the river widened appreciably and to this day, more than 50 years later, insufficient riparian habitat encroachment to provide shading has occurred along much of the river channel. Significant reaches of it are still exposed to nearly constant spring and summer sunlight. The water depth has also decreased in much of the channel due to massive bedload contributions from the 1964 flood, so this shallower, often wider channeled water is much easier to increase in temperature in the summer sunlight. Summaries of the affected 5th field watersheds follow, and largely originate from the Project fish Biological Assessment. A HUC 5 watershed burn severity table can be seen in the BA. Figure 3-12 Map showing the sub-basins (HUC 4) and watersheds (HUC 5) affected by the fires of 2015 in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. (Project Biological Assessment) New River Nearly 44% of this watershed burned in the 2015 fire complexes. Fortunately, less than 3% of the watershed was severely burned and the vast majority of it was burned at a very low to low intensity. Unburned vegetation (including canopy) remains along the majority of the streams within the River Complex (USFS 2015 – BAER Fisheries Report). Fifty-four miles of accessible anadromous fish habitat, including availability to all of the fish species listed in this report, occur in several New River tributaries and the mainstem. The New River watershed is identified as a Tier 1 Key Watershed in the Northwest Forest Plan. These watersheds serve as refugia for maintaining and recovering habitat for at-risk stocks of anadromous salmonids and resident fish species and provide high quality water. Surveys for ‘summer-run steelhead and spring Chinook salmon’ are conducted annually in the New River and have been occurring since 1990. Note: the summer-run steelhead is a recognized strain of the USFS Sensitive KMP steelhead. The summer steelhead in the New River is not technically a Management Indicator Species because the ‘MIS’ status is designated for the South Fork Trinity River only (LRMP 1995). Similarly, spring-run Chinook salmon are a recognized strain of UKT Chinook salmon, also a USFS Sensitive species. ESA Threatened coho salmon are normally not ‘attracted’ to the New River drainage from the mainstem Trinity River but juvenile coho salmon are sometimes found during the annual surveys. It appears after calculating risk for cumulative watershed effects (CWE94) that no subwatershed in the New River 5th field is at a high risk of serious sedimentation after the fires were extinguished. See Project Physical Science or Fish Biological Assessment documents (2016). This AP Indicator (sedimentation; USDA et al 2004) is deemed properly functioning. Water temperatures are also properly functioning. There may be stream reaches where riparian function may be ‘at risk’, but overall the fifth field riparian habitat is properly functioning. Burnt Ranch The primary fisheries stream in the Burnt Ranch fifth-field watershed is the Big French Creek 6th field watershed. Coho and Chinook salmon have been observed in this stream intermittently. One of the adjacent tributaries with 1.8 miles of coho salmon CH is Swede Creek. The upper portions of this watershed burned intensely enough to likely generate sediment, turbidity, and ash downstream to the lower end and the Trinity River mainstem. Similarly to New River, there is no subwatershed that rises to the level of a high or very high sedimentation risk threshold using the Forest’s CWE methodology. But the fifth field overall is downgraded a step from New River and is considered to be functioning at risk. Water temperatures are properly functioning. The riparian function situation is the same for Burnt Ranch as described above for the New River. Canyon Creek This watershed saw relatively few acres burned, none more than at a moderate severity, and no Project activity is planned within miles of fish habitat. No analysis is required for this basin. Browns Creek Slightly less than five miles of fish habitat occur within this watershed (extending beyond Chanchelulla Creek), and coho salmon actually use it every year. Fortunately, only 36 acres burned at high severity out of 2,953 acres burned. This helps keep the CWE risk at moderate, leaning toward low. Riparian habitat is adequate reflected by the fish numbers seen in the watershed, but is technically designated as ‘functioning at risk’ due to a major forest road existing next to Browns Creek for many miles which puts the mainstem drainage at risk at any given time. Upper South Fork Trinity Only 305 acres burned within this watershed and all of it was of low severity. The environmental baseline did not appreciably change. Middle South Fork Trinity Three different fire complexes burned in this watershed, two (Mad River and Route Complexes) limited to the upper portion and another (Blue Fire of the Mad River complex) focused on the lower portion. 94 Cumulative Effects under ESA are those effects of future state or private activities, not involving federal activities, that are reasonably certain to occur within the action area of the federal action subject to consultation [50 CFR §402.02]. Under NEPA, cumulative impacts are the impacts of the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (federal or non-federal) or person undertakes such other actions. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time. Coho salmon are not known to migrate upward from the mainstem Trinity River to the lowermost portion of this fifth field watershed, instead stopping at the Hyampom Gorge. The lower portion of one tributary, Glenn Creek, provides coho salmon CH (technically…..no fish are seen) and also had the hillslope area adjacent to that reach experience fire. The upper portion of Glenn Creek burned intensely so it may contribute increased sediment and accelerated erosion rates, extending down to and along the South Fork Trinity River. Despite this, debris flows are not necessarily anticipated from Glenn Creek which would have the most severe impact to the mainstem South Fork Trinity River downstream from it. Rattlesnake Creek has several miles of coho salmon CH and because of upper watershed burning, there may be accelerated sediment generated from the tributary to the mainstem of the South Fork Trinity River. Overall, the risk of CWEs in this watershed is calculated to be moderate (Project Physical Sciences report 2016). But it is worth noting that the CWE risk ratio for this overall fifth field rises somewhat through the year 2020 mostly because of the totality of the effects from several tributaries that are expected to generate increased sediment loads from areas of severe and intensely burned landscapes. See a more detailed discussion below on the Forest’s CWE methodology, the Project Physical Science (hydrology) report, and the Project fish BA (all 2016). Riparian function and water temperature indicators are both considered to be ‘functioning at risk’ in this fifth field watershed. Table 3-61.

Three tributaries have varying lengths of coho salmon CH, and therefore EFH. All but one of the tributaries has a moderate to very high CWE risk ratio. In general, tributaries in this kind of condition are not best suited to suffer consequences from wildfire unless of a very low intensity. Past timber harvests and the presence of many miles of roads are the primary reason for this CWE status. There will be accelerated erosion and sediment generated from many of these tributaries in part because of there being significant areas of private timber lands that are already being liquidated of their timber via active salvage. Even though there probably will be measureable increases in overall sedimentation for several years, STNF-originating accelerated erosion may be comparatively small when measured against the already high erosion rates prior to the 2015 fires, the fires themselves and the material generated from private lands. The indicators of water temperature and riparian function are both considered to be ‘functioning at risk’. Naturally cool river and stream reaches of groundwater-derived sources help keep tributaries cooler than what otherwise might happen, and large woody debris will likely beneficially increase in some of these tributaries having experienced fire. Lower Hayfork Eight different tributaries have varying lengths of coho salmon CH and therefore EFH, but actual coho salmon use is either rare or perhaps today non-existent. However, other species like steelhead and resident rainbow trout may do relatively well in areas of this watershed. This may be explained by the majority of the tributaries having a low to moderately low risk ratio as per CWEs. Water temperatures generally degrade while working downstream from the upper portion of this watershed from functioning at risk, to not properly functioning. The primary reason is because of water that is too warm for cold water fishes in mid-to late-summer caused in part by small water volumes that are too easily heated diurnally. Overall much of the watershed has riparian habitat that is effectively not functioning because much of it has been obliterated prior to these 2015 fires. Some tributaries have riparian habitat that is functioning at risk. Upper Hayfork Creek The fire named the Fork Complex burned within a portion of this watershed area. Although it has been several, perhaps many, years since coho salmon have been viewed in this watershed area, coho salmon critical habitat and therefore EFH exists in several tributaries and in Hayfork Creek because the habitat is accessible by anadromous fish. One of the tributaries, Wilson Creek, had intense and severe burning such that increased peak flows and fire-related products (ash and sediment) may migrate downstream to the confluence with Hayfork Creek. This is an unfortunate circumstance because a fish passage improvement project was constructed in Wilson Creek recently. Young steelhead were observed in Wilson Creek in late summer 2015. A tributary named Barker Creek and its largest water and sediment contributor named Little Barker Creek received enough intense and severe burning such that increased peak flows, turbidity, sediment loads, and ash delivery is expected to reach Hayfork Creek during storm events. The CWE risk ratios did not elevate past Moderate anywhere, with more frequent Low ratings. But there will be increased soil erosion such that a predicted undisturbed rate of two tons per acre might get as high as 55 tons per acre for a year or two in the most severely burned areas from just a modest-sized storm. Putting the previous conditions together, the erosion hazard rating was considered high overall. Much of this material would be generated in debris flows within drainages such as Little Barker Creek – up to an 80% chance for a 100,000 cubic meter debris flow in a ten-year storm event. Accompanying this are estimated peak flows that increase from 31% to 112% depending on the drainage and the size of storm up to a five year recurrence interval within a seven year time period (Physical Sciences Report 2016). Riparian habitat overall is at best in fair condition; technically, at risk. Alternative Effects Analysis – Including the No Action Alternative The analysis of impacts is focused on salmonids, lamprey and their ‘Habitat Indicators’ that may be affected by the proposed and the other action alternatives. Specifically, this analysis uses key indicators of habitat quality as identified in the Analytical Process (USDA et al 2004). Primary Habitat Indicators that may be affected by the proposed action or the other action alternatives are Water Temperature; Suspended Sediment and Turbidity; Stream Substrate Character; Large Woody Debris; Streambank Condition; Change in Peak and Base Flows; and Riparian Reserves. Thus, the discussion of direct and indirect effects is organized by these Habitat Indicators. See the Project fish BA for further elaboration. The fish species and habitat resources assessed for impacts are first listed under the Executive Summary. The effects of the specific alternatives will be assessed via determining the probable or possible impacts, if any, of the discreet Project elements upon the selected habitat indicators. From the AP guidance document (USDA et al 2004): An assessment may include "an analysis of the effects of the action on the species and habitat, including consideration of cumulative effects, and the results of any related studies" (50 C.F.R. § 402.12(f) (4)), depending on the nature of the federal action. Effects of the action are defined in 50 CFR § 402.02 as: “The direct and indirect effects of an action on the species or critical habitat together with the effects of other activities that are interrelated or interdependent with that action that will be added to the environmental baseline. Indirect effects are those that are caused by the proposed action and are later in time, but are reasonably certain to occur. Interrelated actions are those that are part of a larger action and depend on the larger action for their justification. Interdependent actions are those that have no independent utility apart from the action under consideration”. Direct Effectsare also defined under NEPA (40 CFR 1508.8): Direct effects are caused by the action and occur at the same time and place’. Again, from the AP guidance document (2004): Indirect effectsare caused by the action and are later in time or farther removed in distance, but are still reasonably foreseeable. Indirect effects may include growth inducing effects and other effects related to induced changes in the pattern of land use, population density or growth rate, and related effects on air and water and other natural systems, including ecosystems. Effects and impacts as used in these regulations are synonymous. Effects include ecological (such as the effects on natural resources and on the components, structures, and functioning of affected ecosystems), aesthetic, historic, cultural, economic, social, or health, whether direct, indirect, or cumulative. Effects may also include those resulting from actions which may have both beneficial and detrimental effects, even if on balance the agency believes that the effect will be beneficial. As stated above under Analysis Methodology, implementation of any of the action alternatives will require discreet actions that can be separated into these specific activities, or so-called Project Elements: • PE 1 -Hazard Tree Mitigation and Reforestation • PE 2 -Fuels Reduction Initial Entry • PE 3 -Commercial Salvage • PE 4 -Temporary Road Ramps, Landings, and Water Drafting • PE 5 -Routine Road Preparation and Maintenance, Legacy Sediment Site Treatments, • Stream Crossing Reconstruction, and Road Decommissioning • PE 6 -Fuels Reduction Maintenance Effects TerminologyEffects to CH, EFH, Sensitive species and MIS aquatic habitats are described using the following terms: • Neutral Effect. The action has no effect on the aquatic habitats. • Beneficial Effect. The effect is contemporaneous and has positive effects without any adverse effect to the aquatic habitats. • Discountable Effect. The effect to CH, EFH or the other species aquatic habitats is extremely unlikely to occur and/or based on best judgment, a person would not be able to meaningfully measure, detect, or evaluate any effects. • Insignificant Effect. The effect to the aquatic habitats may occur but is not to a level that can be meaningfully measured or detected. • Significant Effect. The effect to the aquatic habitats is detectable, and may be meaningfully measured. Effects to coho salmon and the other aquatic species addressed in this report are described using the following terms: • Neutral Effect. The action has no effect. • Minor Effect. Effects would result in detectable effects to an individual/s, but they would not be expected to result in substantial population fluctuations and would not be expected to have any measurable long-term effects on species. Minor effects equate with a “May Affect/Not Likely to Adversely Affect” ESA consultation determination. • Moderate Effect. Effects would result in detectable impacts on individuals or population of a listed species. Moderate level adverse effects would equate with a “May Affect/Likely to Adversely Affect” ESA consultation determination. • Major Effect. Individuals or population(s) of a listed species or one addressed in this report would be measurably affected. Key ecosystem processes might be permanently altered resulting in longterm changes in population numbers and permanently modifying CH or aquatic habitat. Major effects may result in jeopardy to the continued existence of a population unit, ESU, or species. Depending upon the nature of the effect being considered, two or more of the six Project elements may be combined when anticipated effects are fundamentally identical. As per guidance in the Analytical Process for Developing Biological Assessments for Federal Actions Affecting Fish within the Northwest Forest Plan Area (‘AP’; USDA et al 2004), the elements above will be evaluated against selected habitat indicators that are relevant to the action alternatives. The Table for Population and Habitat Indicators found in the AP document urged modification for local forest conditions which was done for the STNF. The version used on the STNF is illustrated in Appendix A of the Fish BE and MIS Report and is titled “Matrix of Factors and Indicators.’ Refer to the Project BA (2016) to see how the various Habitat Indicators are grouped. Summarized, they are headed by the general categories of Sediment, Water Quality, and Riparian Function. As per the AP, the Project elements will be tested for potential effects to the habitat indicators by up to eight factors, defined as follows: a.  Proximity ~ The geographic relationship between the Project element or action and the species/designated critical habitat.  b.  Probability ~ The likelihood that the species or habitat will be exposed to the biotic or abiotic effects of the PE or action to the indicator.  c.  Magnitude ~ The severity and intensity of the effect.  d.  Distribution ~ The geographic area in which the disturbance would occur (may be several small effects or one large effect).  e.  Frequency ~ How often the effect would occur.  f.  Duration ~ How long the effect would last. Potential categories include (a) short-term event whose effects subside immediately (pulse effect); (b) sustained, long-term effect, or chronic effect whose effects persist (press effect); and (c) permanent event that sets a new threshold for a species’ environment (threshold effect).  g.  Timing ~ When the effect would occur in relation to the species’ life-history patterns.  h.  Nature ~ Effects of the action on elements of a species’ life cycle, population size or variability, or distribution; or on the primary constituent elements of critical habitat, including direct and indirect effects.  Proposed actions that yield insignificant, discountable, or no effects can usually be analyzed by the first three, or even fewer, of the factors listed above to adequately determine Project effects. Resource Protection Measures Except for the No Action Alternative, all of the potential Project action alternative effects, be they direct or indirect, will be largely ameliorated or prevented from happening via Project Resource Protection Measures (RPMs). Project-related RPMs are developed to minimize impacts to resources in the area from this Project. The following resource protection measures are incorporated into all action alternatives, unless otherwise noted (Project DEIS, 2016). Numerous RPMs found in several sections of the DEIS – Wildlife and Fish, Riparian Reserves Areas, and Soils and Hydrology, for example – combine to ensure that aquatic resources are protected and potential impacts or adverse effects to aquatic habitat are either eliminated or greatly minimized. Some examples are included here: Field personnel and equipment will not enter waterways where anadromous fish are determined to be spawning or eggs would be incubating, as determined and indicated by a fish biologist. Restricted time periods are generally from October 15 through April 15. Additional restrictions may be appropriate for waterways containing spring Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and summer-run steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss), as determined by a qualified fish biologist (focus is protection of spawning and incubating eggs). To avoid potential watershed-related impacts, including effects to anadromous fish, Project activities will occur between April 15 and October 15. This time period is referred to as the normal operating season, or aquatic period of operation (also discussed with BMPs and Wet Weather Operation Standards elsewhere in this report). No units are immediately adjacent to anadromous fish habitat; therefore, no Project equipment or vehicle-related direct effects are possible, for example, outside of potential water drafting sites that may be chosen within anadromous fish habitat. See Appendix B in the Project Fish BE and MIS Report for a list of specific aquatic habitat related RPMs developed for this Project. Best Management PracticesBest management practices (BMPs) are required to control nonpoint source pollution related to all management actions with the potential to affect water quality on National Forest System lands (FSM 2532). All NEPA decisions are to incorporate site-specific BMPs for protecting water quality (FSH 2509.22). BMPs have been selected for this Project (Appendix C) from the USDA Forest Service National BMP compilation (USDA, 2012) BMPs were developed to comply with Section 208 of the Clean Water Act. BMPs have been certified by the State Water Quality Resources Control Board and approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the most effective way of protecting water quality from impacts stemming from non-point sources of pollution. These practices have been applied to forest activities and have been found to be effective in protecting water quality on the STNF. Specifically, effective application of the US Forest Service Region 5 BMPs has been found to maintain water quality that is in conformance with the Water Quality Objectives in the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board’s (NCRWQCB) Basin Plan. Forest Service Region 5 BMPs have been monitored and modified since their original implementation in 1979 to make them more effective. Numerous on-site evaluations by the NCRWQCB have found the practices to be effective in maintaining water quality and protecting beneficial uses. The STNF monitors the implementation and effectiveness of BMPs on randomly selected projects each year. Adequate implementation of BMPs occurred on an average of 85 percent of sites from 2006 through 2010. BMP effectiveness requirements were met on an average of 95 percent of the sites sampled in 2006-2010. – Best Management Practices: Soil and Water Conservation Handbook (USDA Forest Service 2011). The list of BMPs that would be implemented are designated in Appendix C. For additional information on the BMPs and their objectives, see the Water Quality Management for Forest System Lands in California No Action Alternative -Alternative 6 To meet the intent of 40 CFR 1502.14(d) a No Action alternative will be analyzed. Based on Forest Service policy direction, this is interpreted to mean that no new action will occur from this alternative. The no action alternative is not a baseline condition, but rather a description of current and projected future circumstances without implementation of the Trinity Post Fire Fuels Reduction and Salvage Project. The no-action alternative incorporates a continuation of the current general level of management on federal, state, and private lands, as well as projected future management activities including, for example, road maintenance, hazard tree removal, recreation, watershed restoration projects, other projects with vegetation management, and fire suppression. The contexts of these analyses are in relation to the species considered in this report and their habitats necessary to survive and reproduce. Fuels would not be reduced within any potential treatment buffers, hazard trees may not be felled and left onsite at least to the degree proposed in this Project and/or commercially disposed of, and legacy stream-road crossings may not be improved nor any roads decommissioned or addressed in any way outside of routine maintenance that would have occurred regardless of this Project. No Project-related sediment would be generated whatsoever by choosing the No Action alternative, nor would any possibility exist of the other habitat indicators being adversely affected directly or indirectly to any extent by implementation of the Project elements. But the Purpose and Need of this Project is not to avoid generating any sediment production nor affecting in any way the habitat indicators used to evaluate the effects of this Project. See the Purpose and Need statement listed above. The majority of any Project-related sediment and any other potentially minor adverse effects would be short term in nature. It’s also possible that up to 30,000 cubic yards of road fill will not be rendered inaccessible to streams that are currently at risk of it becoming incorporated into stream flow transport due to the several undersized culverts of which this massive amount of road fill sediment surrounds. Direct Effect of Taking No Action If No Action is chosen or otherwise not taken, then the six Project elements will not be implemented. No direct effects would occur to any of the fish species considered in this report nor any portion of their required habitat components including the habitat indicators such as water temperature, suspended sediment and turbidity, stream substrate quality, large woody debris, streambank condition, change in peak and base flows, and riparian reserves. Indirect Effects of Taking No Action There would be no indirect effects if no actions are taken to cause direct effects. But over time, there could be consequences from taking no action that could indirectly cause adverse effects to the fish or their required habitats addressed in this report. This could result from illegal or unauthorized harvest of trees within the treatment buffer because of ease of access. Any such activities that could occur would not honor Project RPMs or BMPs so the activity would surely promote greater sedimentation or other adverse effects (Physical Sciences Report 2016). Later in time, more frequent or more severe and intense wildfires could occur if no fuels treatments were initiated in areas calculated to require them via the Project. Human life could be incidentally at risk if no or an insufficient number of 2015 wildfire-killed hazard trees were felled, possibly allowing remaining trees to spontaneously fall upon humans, human-occupied vehicles on roads, or unoccupied vehicles or other property. No fuel breaks would be constructed. The maintenance unquestionably required for several years to maximize the desired effect if one of the action alternatives were instead to be chosen would also not occur. Cumulative Effects under ESA: The No Action alternative does not add any proposed action subject to consultation to the other ongoing and future State or private activities; hence, there cannot feasibly be any cumulative effects as a result. Cumulative Impacts under NEPA: The No Action alternative does not add any proposed action to other past, present, or reasonably foreseeable future actions, hence no incremental impacts can possibly occur. But as described above, taking no action could directly and indirectly lead to future adverse environmental consequences that would not otherwise occur had the proposed action been implemented. Some of the sequential outcomes of taking no action could be considered individually minor, but collectively significant. Alternative 1 – Proposed ActionAttention given to this Alternative within the confines of anadromous fish habitat will be reduced in this report because a thorough analysis was provided in the Project fish BA. The Project fish BA limited the analysis to SONCC coho salmon and coho salmon Critical Habitat, and to Essential Fish Habitat for SONCC coho and UKT Chinook salmon. But the additional fish species and aquatic habitats considered in this report – Pacific Lamprey, KMP steelhead, and resident rainbow trout – would be affected similarly to those described in the Project fish BA except where depicted below. Pacific Lamprey can migrate on occasion further upstream than the upper limit of where SONCC coho salmon critical habitat exists or the uppermost stream reaches for KMP steelhead. Additionally, resident rainbow trout and their required habitats occur on larger tributaries for several miles further upstream than any of the other fish species considered in this report. But there are no specific actions proposed in this alternative nor RPMs or BMPs that are inherently different when applied to these upstream areas from the actions proposed further downstream in the same Project area tributaries where all of the species and SONCC coho salmon Critical Habitat or salmon EFH do occur. None of the proposed actions will occur disproportionately more frequently or intensively in these upper rainbow trout stream habitat reaches. Direct Effects Direct effects that could occur would result from implementing any or all of the proposed Project elements and assessing how they could affect the selected habitat indicators of Water Temperature; Suspended Sediment and Turbidity; Stream Substrate Character; Large Woody Debris; Streambank Condition; Change in Peak and Base Flows; and Riparian Reserves from the total population of habitat indicators found in Appendix A of the Fish BE and MIS Report. There will be no direct effects to any anadromous fish from implementation of Project elements 1-4 and 6 because no vegetation management will occur in or immediately adjacent to CH or EFH. Direct manipulation of MIS resident trout habitat could occur with the felling of hazard trees that become part of the Large Woody Debris (LWD) component of streamside wood stores. It is technically possible that a rainbow trout could be struck by one or more trees felled directly into stream courses. Also, the upgrading of any stream crossings that could occur in MIS rainbow trout habitat upstream of anadromous fish habitat could be affected. But this is where the sum of the Project EEZs, RPMs, BMPs, ACS and riparian reserve management restrictions limit affects to generally being insignificant for any fish habitat in affected areas, and cause at most a minor effect to Project area fish. The Project Physical Sciences Report (2016) cannot dismiss the possibility during salvage of fire-killed trees of reactivating unmapped or unknown existing landslides. However, the probability is low. Temporary road construction and any new landings could potentially alter surface and subsurface hydrology which might cause turbidity directly to streams. Again, the probability is low. Soil compaction should be a non-issue according to the report, and soil cover percentages should increase via operations, actually decreasing surface erosion. The hydrology portion of the Physical Sciences Report (2016) focuses on two primary habitat variables or equivalent habitat indicators to assess Project impacts, regardless of Alternative: sediment and temperature. Sediment can enter streams from and through riparian reserves during the otherwise beneficial process of felling hazard trees to increase large woody debris reserves. Note that of 37,575 acres of riparian reserve that exists within the burned area footprints, only 1,386 acres will receive direct treatment in the proposed preferred action alternative (DEIS 2016). Water temperature changes should be minimal because the dead trees felled will already be providing little shade to the water surface. Some increase in solar radiation could occur to water surfaces just from the canopy holes that would be created through the action of falling such trees into streams. These canopy clearings would fill back in relatively quickly. See the discussion of riparian reserve management in the Physical Sciences Report, Hydrology section, under Alternative 1 – Direct Effects portion. Certainly the factor of proximity can be met regarding this activity, but the consideration of probability and magnitude of any result yielding more than a minor effect is discountable. Sediment could also be generated directly into stream channels or flowing water from treatment of the legacy road stream crossings via culvert replacement, or treatment of culvert inlets via debris clearing. But road stream crossing restoration will not occur within CH or EFH. Additionally, there is some sediment generated during the first winter after roads are decommissioned just through a disturbed landscape adjusting process, and up to 30 miles of roads could receive that form of treatment. There are specific BMPs (Appendix C) and RPMs (Appendix B of the Fish BE and MIS Report) for stream crossings, road decommissioning, and operations in aquatic ecosystems scheduled to be implemented to address this activity. To summarize, direct contributions of sediment causing turbidity and the potential for streambed sediment deposition to proposed action affected stream courses could occur but should be generally discountable, insignificant, or minor to MIS trout or lamprey, especially during culvert replacement. Therefore stream substrate character should be insignificantly affected. Surface water temperature changes resulting directly from proposed actions should be either insignificant or discountable. Large woody debris (LWD) loads will not decrease below 20 tons per acre in treatment area riparian reserves due to fuels treatments. Hand-felling of fire-killed trees in the inner half of riparian reserves will accelerate the quantity of LWD occurring in adjacent streams. Trees felled directly into streams with MIS rainbow trout fish habitat could conceivably cause direct mortality to individual fish, or at least create harm in the form of injury or stress to them. Potential LWD that could be end-line removed from the outer half of riparian reserves would occur only where there is sufficient LWD already present in the area. Streambank condition could be changed in areas where trees are felled directly into streams for LWD-generating purposes, but generally only for the width of the tree. This degree of change is insignificant and/or discountable. Because of the extent of the relatively minor direct effects described above, potential changes to peak and base flows should be discountable. Indirect Effects The development of the Aquatic Conservation Strategy and associated riparian reserves may play a greater role in minimizing potential adverse indirect effects to aquatic habitats than any other federal land management change during the past quarter century on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Descriptions of this strategy or land reserves can be found throughout this document and the Project fish BA. Slash material generated from commercial salvage logging as a component of hazard tree reduction will beneficially increase soil surface protection and enhance infiltration rates. This could possibly counteract or beneficially exceed any accelerated sedimentation resulting from ground disturbing activities via the felling and yarding of fire-killed trees. Fuels reductions within a maximum 300-foot wide buffer along 233 road miles covering just under 8,000 acres will ultimately reduce fire severity yielding decreased surface runoff and even lesser landslide potential years later. Increased sedimentation from road surfaces as a result of commercial harvest activities will be partially offset by reduced hillslope surface erosion due to Project activities such as mastication and lop and scatter (Physical Sciences Report, 2016). Tilling and mulching landings and access roads, plus water barring access roads will prevent and reduce erosion as time progresses. There will be decreased indirect sedimentation to stream courses over time as legacy stream crossing improvements and road decommissioning sites adjust to receiving winter storms and eventually create resiliency as surface fine sediments are winnowed away. Much of the increased sediment delivery could be a result of road-related erosion. Roads utilized in this alternative will have an estimated increase in sediment yield because of implementing the alternative to 13.6tons per mile of road, from 7.5 tons per mile with background or no action (Physical Sciences report, soils section, 2016). Water temperature changes, which could result from Project-related channel widening in specific reaches, yielding decreasing streamflow depths and increasing water surface areas, are not expected to occur or persist over time. Adverse Project-related effects are expected to be minor. Introduction of LWD to stream courses helps to cause and deepen beneficial pools. Stream substrate character could improve due to LWD introduction perhaps more easily than deteriorate due to any increased sedimentation. Change in peak and base flows could change over time with fewer intense and severe wildfires in the general area due to nearly 8,000 acres of fuels treatments scheduled. Peak flows may decrease but probably not measurably, and base flows remain neutral or possibly increase. These individual effects should collectively range from being insignificant or neutral adverse impacts, to moderately beneficial. Riparian reserve habitat would increase in quality over time after Project treatments. Project fuels reduction would help decrease or eliminate severe or intense future wildfire in treated areas, sparing adjacent riparian habitat from detrimentally burning in severe intensity. Again, the Project fish BA has a more thorough discussion about vegetation management activities and their potential effects. As an example summarized in the BA: “New River has the highest treatment acres in perennial fish-bearing RRs (about 128 acres). The probability of effects is highest in acres adjacent to CH and EFH. However, the probability for indirect effects associated with sediment from the Project is low due to the EEZs proposed for perennial streams, the EEZs proposed for intermittent and ephemeral RRs, RPMs that will minimize site effects and because specific hazard tree guidelines will dictate which few select trees can be felled in roadside RRs.” Reforestation includes planting up to 8,000 acres of roadside treatment areas to accelerate natural burned area reforestation. Most treatment areas are in upper slope and ridgetop locations. Treatment will increase sediment retention capacity and soil cover. The combination of treatment locations and the nature of the work ensures that potential indirect effects would be discountable or even neutral to aquatic habitats. The legacy road treatment sites are discussed in detail in the Project fish BA. A couple of the possible culvert replacement sites occur at or just upstream of SONCC coho salmon Critical Habitat locations. Despite all of these legacy treatments being ultimately beneficial for aquatic resources, there can be short term impacts even with implementation of RPMs and BMPs. These impacts are usually in the form of sediment yield. Culvert replacement projects always yield some sediment upon receiving the first few significant rainstorms of the fall and winter. Similarly, freshly decommissioned roads will provide surface erosion of fine-grained material until some basic surface ‘hardening’ occurs after a few storms. Fill slopes, disturbed cutbanks, road surfaces, and all drainage crossings can provide adjustment sedimentation regardless of how well the task is performed. For rainbow trout and lamprey stream reaches, nearly all stream crossings and riparian reserves that bisect treatment roads are located in upper slope or ridgetop locations along ephemeral or intermittent drainages (Project fish BA 2016). Cumulative Watershed Effects CWEs have been calculated for affected Project watersheds, but it should be noted that the 2015 wildfires have alone created watershed impacts greatly exceeding potential additional effects resulting from the proposed action. Sedimentation generated by the proposed action will likely decrease down to pre-Project levels within 5-10 years (Physical Science Report 2016). The estimated total amount of sediment generated from the proposed action that may in turn enter stream courses throughout the nearly 8,000 acre treatment area, and including the legacy treatment sites, is around 3,640 tons (Physical Sciences Report, Hydrology section, 2016). Project RPMs, EEZs and BMPs prevent this estimate from being appreciably larger. CWE calculations were made for all of the watersheds that combine the 2015 wildfire footprint with the areas comprising the proposed action. These were calculated at the larger area hydrologic unit code (HUC) 5 watersheds, all the way out to the much smaller area HUC 8 watersheds. Despite the estimated increase in tonnage of 3,640 tons of sediment generated from the proposed action compared to background, the level of importance of this material decreases when the CWE ‘disturbance level’ descriptions, correlated with estimated ‘risk ratios’, do not change when comparing the no action alternative with the proposed action. See the hydrology section of the Physical Sciences Report, the Project Fish BA, and Appendix H of the Shasta Trinity National Forest LRMP (1995) for discussions on the concept of risk ratios and thresholds of concern. The following summarized calculations and descriptions can be seen in Tables 36-44 of the Physical Sciences Report, Hydrology section. Note in these nine tables that nearly all of the HUC 8 calculated riskratios decrease when progressing from the 2016 columns to the 2018 and 2020 columns. This indicates a trend of disturbance recovery. Olsen Creek, a 7th field watershed within the Lower Hayfork Creek/Grassy Flat Miners Creek larger basins, maintains a disturbance level of ‘Moderate’ comparing the baseline recovery over five years to the proposed action timeframe. But it should be noted that the actual HUC8 risk ratio figures appreciably increase by values of up to 0.15 by 2018 in one example. This prevents the HUC8 from obtaining a Low disturbance level designation that it would have with the no action alternative, and instead earns a Moderate disturbance level designation. Other HUC8 or larger drainages have their rates of recovery slowed but do not see an actual increase by 2018. A HUC8 watershed within the Lower Eltapom Creek HUC 7 drainage (Lower South Fork Trinity River) sees a risk ratio value of 0.18 greater with the proposed action compared to the no action alternative, and does so via increasing the risk ratio by 0.11 from 2016 to 2018 instead of it decreasing by 0.07 with no action. This prevents the HUC8 from achieving a low disturbance level designation by 2020 instead of a low value with no action. A HUC8 drainage in the Upper Eltapom HUC7 watershed has a risk ratio value of 0.13 greater in 2018 compared to no action but maintains a low disturbance level designation. There is also a HUC8 in the Pelletreau HUC7 watershed that sees a risk ratio 0.09 greater with the proposed action than with the no action alternative. This may be worth noting because the disturbance level designation is ‘Very High’ even with no action. The Sulphur Glade-Waldorf Flat Creek HUC6 must be mitigated in response to the proposed action because it has a very high disturbance level and at a value of 1.22 and 1.19 in 2018 and 2020, is considered above the ‘Threshold of Concern’ as per the Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP, 1995). Three miles of road decommissioning, feasible in this basin, would suffice for comparable mitigation. Similarly, mitigation is required in the Hyampom HUC6, specifically the Big Creek-Hyampom HUC7 within it, because of risk ratios close to 3.0 which leads to a very high disturbance level. No SONCC coho salmon Critical Habitat is available in the affected tributaries, but they do empty into the South Fork Trinity River which has coho CH for its entire length. Values this high clearly place this HUC6 over the TOC. As quoted in the Physical Sciences Report, Hydrology section (2016): “Hyampom subwatershed is over the TOC; therefore, mitigation is required if the Proposed Action is implemented. Hyampom is a planning watershed, and watersheds that are over TOC, regardless of ownership, are not to be further impacted unless they can be improved with appropriate mitigation measures (Forest Plan, page 4-25). To improve Hyampom, it is necessary to reduce the risk ratio (through mitigation) more than the Proposed Action increases the risk ratio. From the ERA model, it is estimated that about 60 miles of road decommissioning (or an equivalent amount of some other type of improvement project) in Hyampom by the year 2020 is necessary if the Proposed Action is implemented. Mechanized hand piling and burning will be replaced with hand piling and burning in Hyampom; thereby reducing the required mitigation to the equivalent of about 36 miles of road decommissioning. Tractor thinning of the unburned to low severity burned areas in Hyampom will be removed from the Proposed Action; thereby reducing the required mitigation to about 22 miles of road decommissioning. With these described modifications, the mitigation opportunities for Hyampom identified in the Sediment Source Inventory Report” are more than sufficient to implement the Proposed Action”. There are several HUC8 watersheds that achieve risk ratio values of around 0.10 greater than the no action alternative but do not exceed the TOC at the HUC5 basin size. One HUC8 tributary within the Hall City-Wilson Creek Huc7 drainage has the risk ratio 0.29 greater than no action in 2018 but maintains its moderate disturbance level designation. In the Burnt Ranch HUC5, there is a HUC8 in the Lower Big French HUC7 that sees an increase in the disturbance level from low to moderate by 2020 with the proposed action compared to only a low rating for the no action. But this change in disturbance is caused by an increase of only 0.05 in risk ratio compared to no action, a value much less than several other HUC7 changes by 2020 throughout the fire footprint area when disturbance levels do not change in those other examples. There is a HUC6 called Big Creek-New River that has a risk ratio increase from 0.33 to 0.41 in 2018 compared to 0.28 in 2018 with no action. This is because a HUC8 within the complex sees a risk ratio jump from 0.33 to 0.49 in 2018 compared to recovering to 0.26 with no action. The increases in the HUC7 and HUC8 elevate the disturbance threshold to moderate from low. Another HUC6 within the New River HUC5 named Upper Big Creek-New River sees the risk ratio increase from 0.27 to 0.37 with the proposed action by 2018, whereas no action yields a ratio of 0.22. Both values lie within the low disturbance level but it is a sizeable risk ratio numerical increase. HUC7 Bell Creek sees an increase of 0.15 by 2018 compared to no action, and sees a moderate disturbance level of 0.41 in 2020 when compared to a low value of 0.29 with no action. One of the HUC8’s within the Bell Creek HUC7 increases from a low to moderate disturbance level with a 2018 risk ratio of 0.51 compared to 0.29 with no action. Finally, a HUC8 within the Barron –Caraway Creek HUC7 in Upper New River HUC6 has a 2018 risk ratio increase to 0.70 from 0.52 when the no action alternative would see it be at 0.47. Both figures lie within the moderate disturbance level but the risk ratio is 0.23 greater. In summary, the proposed action will yield about 3,640 tons of Project-related fine sediment spread out over the entire 233 road mile treatment areas and legacy sites. This yield prevents a possible determination of a ‘No Effect’ analysis result. Upon implementing the proposed action, this sediment yield may be concentrated in areas of HUC8s where risk ratios take the biggest jump upward and in areas of high to very high disturbance level descriptions. Despite the attention drawn above to the smaller HUC 7 and HUC 8 sized watersheds above, what truly matters is described in the Project Fish BA: “Although a change in the risk ratio of a few percent relative to the baseline condition is common (especially at the HUC 7 and 8 scales) these changes are considered to be fairly negligible. Only the changes that cause a change in the risk description (e.g. moderate in the baseline CWE and high in the Proposed Action CWE) are specifically addressed in the text”. Table 3-62.

For much more detail, find the additional information in the Project EIS and in the Project Forest Vegetation and Physical Science Reports (2016). The area proposed for treatment with this alternative increases from just under 8,000 acres in the proposed action, to about 9,522 acres in this one. The main reason is because the treatment buffer is not variable such as it is in the proposed action, but rather a fixed 300 feet total width throughout the entire buffer along 217 miles of road. Although the number or miles of road is reduced from 233 to 217 to receive this treatment, the remaining 16 miles will receive strategically located fuel breaks totaling 2,178 acres. These fuel breaks can be constructed within a treatment buffer that extends out 600 feet on both sides of the road, or 1,200 feet in total width. See the Project EIS or Project Forest Vegetation and Physical Science Report for a detailed description of the specific actions to occur within the 217 mile treatment buffer or the 16 mile intensive fuel break treatment area. Another difference between the proposed action and this alternative (Project EIS 2016): “Existing unauthorized roads may be utilized as temporary roads to access existing or new landings. Unauthorized roads utilized will be decommissioned after completion of Project activities”. See Table 3-62 to compare treatment data among all of the various alternatives (derived from the Project DEIS, 2016). Note that the fuel break acres are added to the fuel reduction treatment acres. The Project elements listed at the beginning of this section apply to this alternative, as do the habitat indicators. Generally, the differences in potential effect between this alternative and alternative 1 is from the increase in treatment areas for harvest and fuel break as per Table 2-2. Direct Effects Approximately 500 additional tons of sediment could be produced both directly and indirectly from implementing this alternative compared to alternative 1, or 4,140 total tons. There could be a slight increase in risk for landslide potential compared to no action and alternative 1 because green but dying trees can be harvested in this alternative compared to only dead trees being cut in Alternative 1. Therefore, there may be more hazard trees felled that reach streams containing MIS rainbow trout or their habitat. There will not be any change to direct effect risk to anadromous fish, however, because like Alternative 1, no Project activities will take place adjacent to coho or Chinook salmon or KMP steelhead aquatic habitats. There will be an additional 2,178 acres of fuel break activities implemented in this alternative that are not conducted in Alternative 1. This incorporates Project element 2.From the Soils section of the Physical Sciences Report (2016): “The larger fuel breaks will create an additional 14 miles of possible mechanical thinning that could cause additional erosion, displacement, compaction and puddling off the main roads”. Direct effects in the form of some sedimentation and turbidity may occur identically to Alternative 1 if the legacy site treatments remain the same throughout the various alternatives. Despite the increases in treatment area compared to the proposed action, the environmental impacts should not appreciably increase because of the RPMs, EEZs and BMPs that will apply to every acre treated in this and every action alternative. Note specifically the RPMs of 20-33 and 41-48 in Appendix B, and the BMPs listed in Appendix C, both found in the Project Fish BE and MIS Report. Outside of these changes, the direct effects analysis written for alternative 1 applies to this alternative as well. Indirect Effects The fuel breaks could reduce future fire intensity and the rate and degree of fire spreading. This would positively affect sediment yield and turbidity, riparian reserve condition, and the remaining habitat indicators beyond a decade. Additionally, more acres would be subject to treatment-connected reforestation via tree planting. This activity clearly improves the status of all of the habitat indicators under consideration progressively over time. Conversely, construction of the 2,178 acres of fuel breaks could lead to some degree of erosion that could be distributed to adjacent stream courses via the outcome described above under the ‘Direct Effect’ portion. Implementation of this alternative could generate about 500 tons more sediment than the proposed action as stated above under Direct Effects (Physical Science Report 2016). The majority of the increased tonnage will be generated from the Lower South Trinity River HUC5 (300 tons) and the Burnt Ranch HUC5 (200 tons). However, one fifth field watershed, Upper Hayfork Creek, will generate 100 fewer cubic yards of sediment under alternative 2. The 500 additional cubic yards of sediment is ‘consequential’ but, when spread out over several years and generating from the acreage of the entire Project, it borders on being insignificant to minor in overall effect. Much of this increased sediment is a result of road-related erosion. Similar to Alternative 1, roads utilized in this alternative will have an estimated increase in sediment yield because of implementing the alternative to 13.6 tons per mile of road, from 7.5 tons per mile with background or no action (Physical Science report 2016). In summary, excluding the differences between the proposed action and alternative 2 that are described above, the remaining description under alternative 1 above applies to this alternative in terms of treatments and effects to the fish species under consideration in this report. RPMs and BMPs will remain the same throughout this and all the alternatives. Cumulative Watershed Effects As indicated above, additional actions associated with this alternative that will not occur in alternative 1 involve fuel break construction and removal of dying but still green trees. The changes in treatment acreage and different activities associated with the proposed action and alternative 2 will yield an estimated 4,140 tons of sediment by 2018 if implemented as scheduled, 500 more tons than the proposed action. As stated in the Physical Science Report, Hydrology Section: “In Lower South Fork Trinity River, Hyampom subwatershed is over the TOC; therefore, mitigation would be required if Alternative 2 is implemented. From the ERA model, it is estimated that mitigation equivalent to about 100 miles of road decommissioning would be required. If hand piling and burning is done instead of mechanized piling and burning, and the harvest thin in the unburned to low severity burned areas is removed from Alternative 2, then about 30 miles of road decommissioning would be required for mitigation. Mitigation opportunities for Hyampom are identified in the Sediment Source Inventory Report (Appendix E)95. The HUC7s and HUC8s that are overtheTOC forAlternative 2, arealso overforthe Proposed Action. In Middle South Fork Trinity River, Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat subwatershed is over the TOC; therefore, mitigation would be required if Alternative 2 is implemented. From the ERA model, it is estimated that mitigation equivalent to about 26 miles of road decommissioning would be required. If mechanized piling and burning is replaced with hand piling and burning, 95 As this is a direct quotation from the Physical Sciences Report, Appendix E in this context refers to Appendix E of the Physical Sciences Report.  That appendix has been reproduced in its entirety in the EIS as Appendix D. and the harvest thin in the unburned to low severity burned areas is removed from Alternative 2, then about 6 miles of road decommissioning would be required for mitigation. Mitigation opportunities for Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat are identified in the Sediment Source Inventory Report (Appendix E). Like the Proposed Action, Hitchcock Creek-Oak Flat drainage and its subdrainages are at very high disturbance levels”. CWE tables provided in the Physical Sciences Report for this alternative yielded only a few appreciable differences when comparing it to alternative 1. In the Burnt Ranch HUC5, the Don Juan/Del Loma and Lower Big French HUC8s jump upward consequentially. In the Lower Hayfork HUC5, the Olson Creek HUC7 increases more than with alternative 1. In the Lower South Fork HUC5, Lower Eltapom HUC8 increases over alternative 1, and Pelletreau increases more. None of these largely HUC8 numerical increases led to changes in risk ratio disturbance level descriptors based on risk threshold status. Therefore, the potential adverse effects to MIS rainbow trout beyond felling of additional hazard trees described above is essentially the same for this alternative compared to alternative 1. Alternative 3 – Wide Buffer A consistent 600 foot wide buffer will be used with this proposal, 300 feet on each side of 233 miles of road. The treated acreage in this alternative jumps up to nearly 15,200 acres, or nearly double the size of the proposed action. As stated above under Alternative 1 and 2, the same RPMs, EEZs and BMPs will apply so there should be no appreciable change to the management of riparian reserves and the consequences from implementing this action on a per forested acre or per road mile basis. Refer to Table 2-2 to denote different treatment data. Besides acreage increases, the other minor changes regarding this action compared to the proposed action are 1) hazard trees would be identified using a probability of mortality of 0.6; 2) commercial timber sales of harvested hazard trees could be feasible along 128 miles of road as with the previous two alternatives but would apply to 7,700 acres; and 3) up to three miles of unauthorized but existing roads could be utilized as temporary roads to access landings but would be decommissioned after Project completion. The estimated sediment tonnage to be generated by this alternative is 6,470 tons, nearly 2,500 more tons than with the proposed action and nearly 2,000 tons more than with alternative 2. This mirrors the big increase in treatment acres. The timeline for implementation will not lengthen because of the increased acreage, so there will be greater sediment production rates in the same or similar amount of time as the previous two alternatives. The legacy treatment sites will remain the same so their sedimentation, temperature and other habitat threats will be the same as in the proposed action or alternative 2. Direct Effects As stated in the Physical Science report, Soils section (2016): Alternative 3 could cause more erosion, compaction, displacement, and puddling than Alternatives 1 and 2 due to the larger footprint for mechanical equipment operations off the main road, especially temporary roads (utilizing up to 3 miles of unauthorized roads). These 3 miles of unauthorized roads will be used as temporary roads to access existing or new landings. Additional displacement and compaction would occur, requiring sub-soiling and mulching as per the soil RPMs. This larger treatment area in severely burned landscapes that already lacks soil cover will be more prone to erosion than Alternatives 1 and 2. There could be a greater threat of direct effects to MIS trout via mortality, injury or stress due to additional felling of trees into stream channels potentially containing trout. A greater number of such trees could reach stream channels because a probability of mortality method will be used to decide the fate of many trees, leading to a greater number being felled overall compared to any of the other action alternatives. The direct effects possibly resulting from sedimentation with this alternative may, in some hillside treatment cases – primarily fuels reduction and harvest -simply be 50% greater than, and up to double the effect as that described in the proposed action due to the doubling in the treatment acreages. But the reason why the overall sedimentation will not double is in part because the road mileages used will remain the same as in the previous two alternatives (Table 2-2). The intensity of the use will increase but that does not add to sediment loads as quickly as adding more miles of additional roads. Indirect Effects The HUC5 watersheds where the majority of the sediment yield will take place are Lower Hayfork (from 600 tons in alternative 1 to 1,000 tons); Lower South Fork Trinity (500 to 900 tons); Middle South Fork Trinity (500 tons to 1,000 tons); and New River (1,000 tons to 2,000 tons). A description of the Project element effects for this alternative is similar to alternative 1 and 2, but progressively larger than alternative 2. It may be applicable to assume that indirect effects and any risks associated with them increase proportionately to the estimated percentage increase in tons of sediment when implementing this alternative compared to alternatives 1, 2, 4 and 5. See below. Because there will be no lessening of RPMs, EEZ standards, or BMPs, nor will there be an increase in legacy road treatment miles, crossings or areas, there should not be an appreciable increase in adverse effects to anadromous fish -coho salmon CH, coho and Chinook salmon EFH or KMP steelhead habitat, Pacific Lamprey habitat -or MIS rainbow trout. Cumulative Effects Despite the nearly 6,500 tons of sediment to be generated via the implementation of this alternative – a 62% increase over the proposed action – there are no additional fifth field planning watersheds that have their CWE threshold of concern surpassed when they would not have been surpassed when implementing the other alternatives. Those that are high or very high – described in the proposed action – remain the same and the need for mitigation remains the same or similar. See the discussion above under the proposed action, or the Physical Science report, Hydrology section, for descriptions of the specific watersheds that are over the TOC. Numerical changes for lesser sized watersheds regarding this alternative follows: Burnt Ranch HUC5: Don Juan/Del Lom-Trinity River HUC 6 and 7 increase appreciably compared to alternative 1 and the no action alternative. New River HUC5: Big Creek sees a sizeable increase; Upper Devil’s Canyon increases; Don Juan/Del Loma increases; Bell Creek and Barron Creeks see sizeable increases. Lower Hayfork Creek HUC 5: Olson Creek HUC7 sees an appreciable increase. Upper Hayfork HUC5: Chanchalula increases; the Hall City-Wilson Creek HUC8 increases enough for the Disturbance Indicator to change from Moderate to High; Bridge and Carrier Gulches HUC 8s increase. In summary, implementation of the Project elements with this alternative would generate about 62% greater sedimentation and turbidity than alternative 1, possibly preserving stream substrate character less while still generating LWD, retain but put at risk some streambank conditions, increase the probability of detrimental changes to base and peak flows, and somewhat strain the aquatic conservation strategy regarding riparian reserves. Alternative 4 – Northern Spotted OwlTable 2-2 indicates that the road buffer width in alternative 4 will yield the same treatment acreage as alternative 1 (7,969 acres). The fuel reduction acreage, however, will drop to 5,840 and the potential hazard tree harvest road miles will decrease to 20 miles from the 128 miles available in the three previous alternatives. Tree harvest acreage in this alternative (782 acres) is barely 10% of that available in alternative 3, and less than 20% available in the proposed action. The reason for the reductions in these treatment acreages is because habitat for northern spotted owls would be avoided for salvage, fuels reduction, and follow-up maintenance. Only hazard tree felling by hand could occur within spotted owl habitat, but felled trees would need to be left as fallen. Approximately 1,600 cubic yards of sediment would be generated to stream courses from this alternative implementation, significantly less than that of the previous three alternatives. Direct Effects Fewer hazard trees would be felled with this alternative reducing the likelihood that some MIS trout could be directly killed, injured, or harmed via stress through trees dropping directly into stream channels. It’s possible that the result of such implementation would cause no effect to living fish and discountable adverse effects to fish habitat. The legacy roads stream crossing improvements and road decommissioning would remain the same if implementing this alternative as with the other alternatives so the risk of direct effects would be the same for this phase of the treatment. But many of the remaining actions would pose less risk than the preceding alternatives because this alternative is closer to the no action alternative than the previous three alternatives, which would provide literally no direct effects of course. Significantly less mechanical disturbance would occur on the native landscapes in spotted owl habitat but would remain the same as the proposed action outside of the owl habitat areas. Indirect Effects Although hand-felled trees remaining on site would tend to beneficially decompose where felled with no additional ground disturbance occurring, those same trees could add to the fuel load during future wildfires, increasing the intensity. As indicated just above, sediment production would be less than half that generated from the proposed action. Whereas this difference is more beneficial incrementally to fish and aquatic resources, it also moves the Project further away from the true purpose and need for action. Implementation of the Project elements with this alternative would generate less sedimentation and turbidity, help preserve stream substrate character more while still generating some LWD, retain streambank condition, decrease the probability of detrimental changes to base and peak flows, and help maintain the aquatic conservation strategy regarding riparian reserves. This alternative, conversely, may create greater fuel hazard environments at a later time and subject areas to more intense wildfire burning. This outcome would likely generate more sediment afterwards than what the difference between the proposed action and this alternative does. Cumulative Effects There would be reduced upward changes in Risk Ratios for many of the watersheds analyzed in this alternative which would correlate with the reduced projected sediment tonnage increases. At the HUC5 scale, the reduction would not change the existing TOC for any of the watersheds already designated to be above the TOC so mitigation activities would still need to occur in these watersheds, described under the CWE of the proposed action. Alternative 5 – Minimum Impact AlternativeThe general treatment buffer area and buffer width would remain the same for this alternative as for the proposed action. What changes with this alternative is that the following sensitive areas would be off-limits to any kind of activity other than hazard tree felling (Project DEIS 2016): • Northern spotted owl suitable nesting, roosting, and foraging habitat; and post-fire foraging • Riparian Reserves • Inventoried Roadless Areas • ‘At-risk’ watersheds See Table 2-2 for the comparative differences in the treatment categories and the Project EIS for a more thorough description of the alternative. Active salvage operations would cease in this alternative as well. The contribution of sediment to Project-area streams would be reduced by over 90% compared to the preferred alternative: 370 tons. Direct Effects There will be no direct effect to fish or fish habitat of any kind or location via vegetation management due to the exclusion of riparian reserve entry. Therefore, no felled hazard trees will be able to reach a stream containing fish. All felled trees will also be left on site in the position they were all felled. Treatment outside of the sensitive areas listed above will have fuel reduction including machine-piling, mastication, chipping, hand-piling and future broadcast burning. Unquestionably, the Project elements that will be implemented (excludes commercial salvage) under this reduced scale of operation will yield less direct effects to the habitat indicators. More than with the previous four alternatives, the portion of direct effects resulting from legacy road treatments compared to the rest of this alternative will be greater because there will be no reduction in legacy road treatments, while the overall alternative direct effect level will decrease. Indirect Effects Similarly to the discussion above, all of the indirect Project element effects to the habitat indicators will be proportionately reduced under this alternative when compared to the other alternatives. It is possible, especially when comparing the implementation of this alternative to alternative 3, for example, that one or more of the habitat indicators may come close to receiving a neutral, or at most a discountable effect compared to an insignificant effect regarding the other alternatives. Cumulative Effects No watersheds will exceed the TOC upon adopting this alternative that do not exceed the TOC in any other alternative because landscape management will be less than the others, excluding the no action alternative. But it also does not appear that risk ratio disturbance levels will change at the HUC5, HUC6, and HUC7 watershed size levels either. It’s possible that one or more HUC8 risk ratios will drop enough such that the disturbance level determination will decrease to the next lower level. Additional Mitigation Guidance and Requirements Water Drafting Water drafting sites will occur at already established locations with existing access and will be located to minimize adverse effects on stream channel stability, sedimentation and instream flows needed to maintain riparian resources, channel conditions and fish habitat.96 Water drafting sites that are not within habitat accessible to anadromous salmonids will be identified first and will be given priority for use. When needed, water drafting may occur in habitat accessible by anadromous salmonids. In all cases where water drafting occurs within such habitat, 2001 National Marine Fisheries Service’s (NMFS) Water Drafting Specifications97 will be adhered to. 96 Forest Plan Standard and Guideline, page 4-58 in the Forest Plan. 97 The 2001 National Marine Fisheries Service’s (NMFS) Water Drafting Specification document is located at http://www.westcoast.fisheries.noaa.gov/publications/hydropower/water_drafting_specification_guidelines.pdf Refer to table 3 in the Fish BE and MIS Report which lists the river or tributary reaches that are accessible to anadromous fish and therefore are coho salmon Critical Habitat. They include the entire South Fork Trinity River, approximately the lower mile of Butter Creek, lower 1.5 miles of Plummer Creek, lower 2 miles of Rattlesnake Creek, New River, and several other tributary reaches within the action area of this Project. In addition, when drafting water outside of critical habitat, the following rules apply.98 a) Allow drafting from fishery streams only where immediate downstream discharge is maintained at 1.5 cubic feet per second (CFS) or greater, and the diversion is not greater than 10 percent of the stream flow. b) Allow drafting from ephemeral streams, intermittent streams, wetlands or constructed ponds provided that sufficient water quantity and quality remains to support associated wildlife species and riparian values (and complies with the NMFS Water Drafting Specifications above). c) Never allow drafting to remove more than 75 percent of constructed pond water. Aquatic Period of Operation (APO). The annual period of normal operations established to protect aquatic resources is from April 15 through October 15. The concept is often referred to as a ‘limited-operating period’ in BMP text and elsewhere. This period may be extended on either end of the stated seasonal range based on occurrence of all of the following criteria: 1) a long term dry weather forecast, 2) the ability to winterize activities at the end of every day, 3) acceptance of recommendations from the district fisheries biologist and/or hydrologist (after meeting the first two criteria), and 4) authorization by the District Ranger (after meeting the first three criteria). Wet Weather Operations Guidelines (USDA STNF 1999) will also be followed whenever activities occur outside of the APO. The Guidelines will be used to guide operations, especially hauling, during periods of wet weather. Earth scientists will examine field conditions to determine when the soil and roads have dried out enough to enable operations to resume without risk of watershed impacts. The earth scientists will make recommendations as to when operations may resume to ensure that BMPs will be met and adverse impacts will be avoided. The STNF Forest Plan Soil Cover Guidelines (pages 4-21 in the Forest Plan) will be met to minimize soil compaction and erosion. Discussion, Conclusions and Determinations It has been determined in the Project Biological Assessment that implementation of alternative 1, the proposed action, may affect, and is not likely to adversely affect coho salmon and/or coho salmon Critical Habitat. This ‘NLAA’ determination would result despite the implementation of Project element 5: “legacy site treatment, stream crossing reconstruction, and road decommissioning”, which has the potential to generate the most sediment directly into stream courses. Were it not for the extent of RPMs, EEZs, BMPs, the ACS and RR management standards to be applied to this Project, adverse effects could be realized with this Project via this Project element. Implementation of the remaining five Project elements together more easily merit a ‘not likely to adversely affect determination’ when considering the effects to habitat indicators using the ‘factors’ for effects consideration (AP; USDA et al, 2004). Review the resource protection measures regarding riparian reserves listed in Appendix B the Fish BE and MIS Report which will minimize adverse effects to the habitat indicators. 98 Forest Plan Standard and Guideline, page 4-25 in the Forest Plan. Project Element 1 – Hazard Tree Mitigation and ReforestationImplementation of this element, scheduled to occur in action alternatives 1-4, will most likely affect flowing water, aquatic and fish habitats via the increased truck traffic associated with removal of any felled hazard trees for commercial purposes. As per the Project Physical Sciences Report (2016), erosion rates increase from 7.5 tons per mile of haul route road comparing its background use state to 13.6 tons per mile during harvest activities. No doubt a portion of that accelerated erosion will migrate to flowing streams either by roadbed surface erosion runoff during the first fall season rains, or via inboard ditch drainage relief. The actual felling of the hazard trees to either remain in place if felled within 150 feet of perennial streams or perhaps yarded away from perennial streams if more than 150 feet away, will affect flowing water very little. There may be virtually no effect to flowing streams when fallen hazard trees are yarded toward roads on slopes outside of riparian reserves. Implementation will not decrease LWD levels; rather, it may increase it in specific reaches of stream where hazard trees are felled within 150 feet of flowing streams but left in place. Streambank condition will not change outside of the few linear feet where hazard trees may be felled toward and into stream courses. This is an occurrence that could happen naturally shortly thereafter regardless, because the trees are dead. The probability of changes in the magnitude of peak and base flows will not appreciably change but rather be affected neutrally or insignificantly. Riparian reserves will certainly be in the close proximity of operations of any of the action alternatives excluding alternative 5, including receipt of direct manipulation. But the magnitude of appreciable adverse changes is discountable. Water temperature should be affected neutrally because canopy levels creating shade over water surfaces will change insignificantly. Reforestation will create no adverse effects but rather mid-to long-term beneficial effects to vegetated hillslopes and adjacent riparian reserves and stream courses by accelerating the incidence of tree canopy, slope stability and shading. Project Element 2 – Fuels Reduction Initial EntryFuels reduction activities will occur with all five action alternatives. See the list of actions common to all alternatives in the Introduction of this report. Fuels reduction will not adversely affect the habitat indicators of water temperature; suspended sediment and turbidity; stream substrate character; large woody debris; streambank condition; change in peak and base flows; and riparian reserves. Removal of dead brush and dying vegetation beyond hazard trees would be included in this Project element, and could occur in all of the special land allocations except in alternative 4 and 5. Project Element 3 – Commercial SalvageYarding of felled commercial hazard trees will not directionally occur toward, into, or through streams but rather away from them. It will also not occur at all within 150 feet of perennial stream courses due to EEZs. Sedimentation which could be expressed by turbidity, suspended sediment, and changes in streambed substrate character could result to an insignificant or discountable extent from commercial hauling of felled hazard tree logs on unsurfaced roads. See the discussion about this under Project element 1. Project Element 4 – Temporary road ramps, landings, and water draftingUp to two miles of currently unauthorized roads could be used for access to landings and nearly one mile of temporary road newly constructed depending on the alternative. Landings may also be reused or created. This element will remove vegetation and compact soils during the implementation of the Project until maintenance activities are completed. See the discussion of this element in the Physical Sciences Report, Soils section (2016). The RPMs associated with this aspect of the Project element should reduce potential impacts of this element to insignificant and/or discountable levels to water temperature; suspended sediment and turbidity; stream substrate character; large woody debris; streambank condition; change in peak and base flows; and riparian reserves. Water drafting (Appendix D of the Project BE and MIS Report) will occur following the RPMs identified in Appendix B of that Report and described above as per the National Marine Fisheries Service 2001 Water Drafting Specifications. Project Element 5 – Legacy site treatments, stream crossing reconstruction, and road decommissioningThe eleven culvert replacement sites will occur where the road fill prism over the currently undersized culverts add up to nearly 30,000 cubic yards of mostly detrimental finer grained sediment materials. One or more of these existing culvert crossings may be replaced by a bridge or natural arch stream crossing, requiring permanent removal of much of the road bed fill material. Despite rigorous application of all Project BMPs and RPMs, excavating quantities this large of road fill sediment will almost certainly inject some fine-grained sediment into the adjacent affected stream courses in at least some of these crossings. For any flowing streams at the time of the pipe replacement, the water will need to be diverted into temporary pipes and may require temporary dams built up or downstream from the crossings. Additionally, there will be a repair to an existing unauthorized stream ford that may have flowing water in the stream at the time of the repair. Although a flow retaining structure may be built just downstream of the repair work, no doubt some turbidity will be released from the site working downstream. This work should not adversely affect any fish or fish habitats, however. Stream reaches will experience diluted turbidity and a return to clarity not far downstream from any point source sediment intrusions, even if such were to occur episodically. Project Element 6 – Fuels Reduction Maintenance This Project element would be less impacting than the initial entry of fuels reduction because less treatment will occur per year for maintenance than any of the seasons of initial entry. Effects Determination Summaries Implementation of these Project elements will create insignificantly adverse effects at most to streams and in turn Critical Habitat of ESA listed as threatened SONCC coho salmon, essential fish habitat for coho and Sensitive UKTR Chinook salmon, and aquatic habitats for Sensitive KMP steelhead and Pacific Lamprey, and MIS designated spring-run Chinook salmon and spring-run (summer) steelhead, both of South Fork Trinity River derivation, and MIS designated resident rainbow trout. The Project will have a minor affect to the fish listed above except for possible incidental direct harm or injury to MIS rainbow trout from the felling of hazard trees within 150 feet of live streams possessing trout for the creation of beneficial large woody debris. It is my determination that the Proposed Action -Alternative 1, as well as the four other action alternatives assuming that Project Element 5 will be implemented identically for all of them – may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect SONCC coho salmon and SONCC coho salmon Critical Habitat (see Project fish biological assessment, 2016). Implementation of the action alternatives will not adversely affect Essential Fish Habitat for SONCC coho salmon and UKT Chinook salmon by virtue of Project Element outcomes being immeasurable in EFH. A trend toward listing under the ESA is not anticipated and viability of Forest Service Sensitive Species is not at risk because implementation of any of the action alternatives meet Standards and Guidelines, will be implemented under exhaustive RPM and BMP stipulations, are subject to EEZs, and do not adversely modify fish and aquatic habitat in the long term. However, some USFS Sensitive status individuals may be adversely affected in the short term via the felling of hazard trees into stream channels for the otherwise beneficial creation of LWD. Impacts to the listed MIS species and their habitats may be measureable in the short term but less so in the long term, and could prove beneficial over allowance of sufficient time via implementation of any of the action alternatives. Geology ___________________________________ Within the project area, a high degree of mass wasting as shallow slope failures, rock fall, ravel, rock slides and debris flow activity has occurred in the past and will continue in the future. In addition, some dormant landslides are located in the project area which might be re-activated during future storms as a result of the 2015 fires. When evaluating geologic hazards and slope stability, the focus of this report is on identifying the geologic conditions and geomorphic processes that have helped shape the watersheds and landscapes, and assessing the suitability and safety of logging equipment (both wheeled and tracked types) on and off project roads. Using that understanding of rock types and characteristics, geomorphic processes, and distribution of geologic hazards, this report will also assess the risk that implementation of any of the proposed alternatives of the project may create or exacerbate the previously mentioned geologic hazards. Methodology The Shasta-Trinity National Forest’s Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) requires that unstable areas or areas that are suspected of instabilities be evaluated as part of project planning. Furthermore, it requires that areas with a high probability of mass wasting from ground disturbing activities be protected. For this project, the areas surveyed for potential geologic impact were limited to those adjacent to roads and within the proposed project buffers. In order to evaluate and protect unstable areas or suspected areas of instability, field data collected for this project was recorded from personal observations taken primarily adjacent to county and Forest Service roads using traditional field methods such as Forest Service and GIS maps, GPS, clinometer, and field book. A total of 20 days were spent in the field, and ten days were devoted to map and report creation. Notes and maps documenting field observations are in the project record. The Forest GIS coverages for bedrock and geomorphology were examined on-screen with fire perimeters, proposed treatments, and project roads superimposed to identify areas where unstable land was impacted by fire and where they might be impacted by project activities. Forest Service maps, GIS databases, and Google Earth images of the fire areas were examined to get a sense for the effects of the fires and to look for recent landslides which may have been missed by the Forest active landslide GIS coverage. A small number of un-mapped, pre-existing, but unmaintained non-system roads were surveyed to identify unstable areas. Rock types were observed to verify bedrock mapping available in the Forest’s GIS bedrock layer. Direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of the alternatives on slope stability were analyzed. An analysis of effects relevant to geology on National Forest lands within the project area for each activity was made. Affected Environment GeologyThe proposed project area lies within the Klamath Mountains Physiographic Province, and is underlain predominantly by Paleozoic and Mesozoic metavolcanic and metasedimentary rock, along with minor amounts of Cretaceous, Tertiary, and Quaternary sediments. Tectonic processes accreted numerous terranes to the western margin of North America and six of these occur within the project area: the Sawyers Bar, Western Hayfork, Rattlesnake Creek, Western Klamath, Pickett Peak, and Yolla Bolly Terranes (Table 3-63). These Terranes were intruded by granitic plutons, including the Wildwood Pluton and Ironside Mountain Batholith. Small outcrops of sedimentary rock, represented by the Great Valley Group, Weaverville Formation, and Pleistocene/Holocene colluvial deposits, occur primarily in the Hyampom and Hayfork Valleys along with scattered patches of topographically-high relict Pleistocene alluvial land surfaces. Figure 3-13 displays the regional distribution of terranes, with the location of the fire complexes indicated. The Sawyers Bar Terrane consists primarily of metasedimentary rock, including some small limestone bodies with known caves. It contains a scattering of dormant landslide deposits, primarily slump and earthflow complexes, amounting to about 10% of the area. One small post-fire debris flow has been documented within the Sawyer’s Bar Terrane, and this was on the north side of Natural Bridge Creek, a short distance north of Natural Bridge picnic area. The debris flow occurred around 2009, following a fire a few years prior. Table 3-63.

It includes the dioritic Ironside Mountain batholith as well as the Hayfork Bally meta-andesite and occupies the eastern half of the South Complex and western portion of the Fork Complex. A few dormant landslides are mapped in this Terrane, and five active east-west trending earthflows on the west-facing slope east of Allen Creek are identified within the fire perimeter. The Terrane also contains small bodies of limestone which could have caves. The Rattlesnake Creek Terrane is an accretionary mélange consisting mostly of highly dismembered ophiolite including slabs of serpentinite and peridotite, basaltic volcanic rocks, radiolarian chert, and limestone knockers. A significant proportion consists of diamictite, a weak metasedimentary rock which is prone to deep seated landslides. It contains a high density of dormant and active landslides in the western half of the South Complex (about 60% of the area within the fire perimeter is composed of this Terrane). Along the west central part of the fire complex, between the South Fork of Trinity River and Eltapom Creek to the east, a large area is mapped almost entirely as dormant landslide. Parts of this polygon do not express the hummocky bench/scarp topography typical of dormant landslides. There are, however, several active landslide areas mapped in the northwest, far west, and southernmost portions of the burn area. In general, the density of dormant and active landslide in the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane (within the fire complex) is much higher than in the Western Hayfork Terrane (<5%). Scattered bodies of serpentinite and peridotite diapirs occur within this Terrane, which could contain naturally occurring asbestos. The Rattlesnake Creek Terrane also contains small blebs99 of limestone which could have caves. The Western Klamath Terrane is an accreted allochthonous oceanic terrane consisting of dismembered upper ophiolite sequences, serpentinite and peridotite, mica schist, metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks, with interbedded shale, siltstone and chert. It includes the Galice Formation. The dismembered ophiolite sequences contain serpentinite and peridotite, which may contain naturally occurring asbestos (NOA). The southwestern portion of the South Complex and the northeastern part of the Route Complex lie within the Western Klamath Terrane. Numerous active and dormant landslides are mapped within this terrane, most notably within the South Fork Trinity River valley. The Pickett Peak Terrane is dominated by the South Fork Mountain Schist, which consists chiefly of fine-grained quartz-albite schist and sparse metachert. The knobby schist outcrops found on South Fork Mountain within the Route and Mad River Complexes may contain small caves suitable for bat habitat. South Fork Mountain also has several areas that are mapped and confirmed as having dormant and active deep-seated landslides as seen in the numerous scarps, slumps, and benches on the slopes. The Yolla Bolly Terrane is a narrow accretionary mélange terrane immediately to the west of the Picket Peak Terrane and is similar in age and geologic composition. This terrane occupies the far western portions of the Route and Mad River Complexes with predominantly west-facing slopes containing several dormant deep-seated rotated slumps and may also contain small caves suitable for bat habitat. The Cretaceous Great Valley Group that outcrops in the project area consists mainly of western outliers of remnant near-shore marine and shallow-shelf deposits of well-indurated siltstone, sandstone, turbidite sequences, and conglomerates. It is represented mostly as limited outcrops within the Fork Complex that are not prone to geologic instability. Plutons in the Klamath Mountains typically form sandy soils and can be particularly prone to shallow debris slides and debris flows in steeper watersheds after wildfire. The Ironside Mountain batholith in the River Complex and the Wildwood Pluton within the Fork Complex contain minor amounts of pyroxenite which could also possibly contain naturally occurring asbestos. Deposits of the mid-Tertiary Weaverville Formation crop out in the vicinity of Hyampom, Hayfork, and above the New River Valley. These consist of weakly consolidated fluvial and lacustrine rocks, thinly laminated, light-colored clay and tuff, alongside coaly deposits of late Oligocene and early Miocene age. Lying predominately near ridgetops, they have low slope gradients, are poorly exposed and should not pose a significant risk of erosion or sliding. 99 A bleb is a small bubble-like inclusion of one mineral within a larger mineral. It refers to a random, unconformable inclusion or pocket of limestone within other types of rock. Older alluvium (Pleistocene) deposits are composed of weakly consolidated non-marine silt, sand, and conglomerate associated with topographically high remnants of old land surfaces. Most of these deposits are at elevations of 3,000 to 4,000 feet, about 2,000 feet or more higher than that of the South Fork Trinity River. Deposits are generally less indurated than the Weaverville Formation, and therefore are more prone to erosion after wildfire. GeomorphologyMost of the geologic terranes of the Klamath Mountains are weak and prone to landslides. Rapid uplift, high precipitation, and seismic activity to the west have created a landscape with abundant deep seated landslides, many of which occupy several square miles. Most of these larger complexes are dormant under present climatic and seismic conditions, though some from tens to hundreds of acres in size are known to be active. Both the dormant and active landslides are very important parts of the landscape because they are often the source of debris slides during wet winters, and the debris slides in turn generate debris flows. Post-fire summer debris flows triggered by the rapid influx of sediment from rills and gullies typical of places like southern California and the Rockies are less common in this region, most likely because intense summer storms occur less frequently. Some of the large active slides near the South Fork Trinity River, and specifically the ones mapped just north of Hyampom, have experienced high to moderate burn severity. The largest area with high burn severity is the eastern slope of Underwood Mountain, and the adjacent areas on both sides of Buckhorn Creek in the northern part of the South Complex. This spot is situated within the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane (as described above), generally with slopes of less than 65% and a small number of dormant landslides located within it. The high burn severity coupled with the high probability of heavy winter rains (NOAA, Sep. 2015), suggests the possibility of reactivating these dormant slides or even the creation of new ones. Geologic Effects Analysis Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects The application of resource protection measures (RPMs) for Riparian Areas, Soils and Hydrology would protect unstable lands and minimize each alternative’s direct, indirect, and cumulative effects. Effects from mechanical off-road equipment (both wheeled and tracked types) on land-sliding would be negligibly increased and thus none of the alternatives would be expected to cause new landslides or reactivate existing ones. All known (mapped and field-verified) active landslides will be flagged and avoided as described in Appendix B of the Geology Report and per RPMs. Proposed Action/Action Alternative 1 (approximately 8,000 acres) Direct Effects Direct effects of fire-killed trees and understory vegetation include the physical disturbances to the soil associated with their removal. Only hazard trees would be felled within 50 feet of unstable and potentially unstable areas. As part of photosynthesis, trees pull moisture from the soil, which helps to regulate soil moisture and increase slope stability. The loss of these trees through fire removes this effect. Therefore, root support and evapotranspiration are not expected to be affected by salvage of fire-killed trees as their roots are dead and the trees no longer transpire. Potential direct effects of tractors and yarding with a ground-based system are potential reactivation of unknown existing dormant or unmapped landslides by: a) rerouting of surface runoff; or b) disturbance to subsurface hydrology affecting springs possibly by compaction or changes in surface and shallow subsurface flow paths. These changes in hydrology can increase subsurface water or cause water to infiltrate previously unsaturated areas making landslides more likely. Direct effects of cable yarding, if used, are less than those caused by tractor logging as ground disturbance would be less. Construction of a new temporary road (<1 mile for this alternative) and new landings would: 1) remove remaining live vegetation (live vegetation increases slope stability through root shear strength and evapotranspiration); 2) on steeper ground, alter and over-steepen slopes through cuts and fills thereby decreasing slope stability; and 3) potentially reroute surface runoff. Temporary roads and landings will be located on gentle slopes (<20%) to minimize earthwork, and will avoid unstable areas, steep slopes below landslide benches and slope positions where they could deliver sediment to streams. Cuts and fills would not exceed 5 feet in height, unless field reviewed and approved by an earth scientist beforehand per RPM 54. Indirect Effects Removal of fire-killed trees and understory vegetation is not expected to cause measurable changes in hillslope stability (see direct effects section concerning evapotranspiration). However, slash from salvage logging would enhance infiltration of water into soils and at the same time protect soils from rilling, gullying, and shallow landslides. Indirect effects of cable yarding include potential for felled logs to roll downhill in steep areas. This could result in additional ground disturbance which could cause changes to hillslope hydrology possibly increasing landslide potential. Decommissioning of temporary roads and landings as well as hydrologic stabilization practices would improve slope drainage and reduce landslide potential. Maintenance of existing roads would correct surface drainage problems, reduce concentration of water, and thereby reduce landslide potential and sedimentation of nearby drainages. RPMs to protect workers from exposure address the probability of naturally occurring asbestos in rock outcrops. Fuels treatments would help reduce future fire severity which would in turn cause a reduction in future landslide potential. The Proposed Action also includes reforestation which would enhance slope and soil stability through evapotranspiration and root shear strength resulting in a reduction in landslide potential. Cumulative Effects The 2015 Fires comprise the background and have overwhelmed previous activities within the burned area. All past and future foreseeable actions (as identified in the EIS) have been considered. The 2015 fires reduced forest and other vegetation cover, reducing transpiration and increasing the likelihood of landslides. The Proposed Action /Alternative 1 would not increase that impact because only dead trees and vegetation would be treated, but would slightly mitigate the effect of soil cover removed by the fire by increasing soil cover through slash production. Due to the limited area treated under the proposed action, any mitigating effects are small compared to the widespread damage created by the fires, resulting in insignificant changes in landslide potential. Overall, the cumulative effects of the Proposed Action/Action Alternative 1 would be a slight decrease in long term risk for land-sliding and mass wasting, due to reduced future fire severity and reforestation efforts. Action Alternative 2: Consistent Buffer and Fuelbreaks Alternative (approximately 9,500 acres) Direct Effects With additional acres under this alternative, there would be a similar disturbance from yarding of salvaged timber but slightly increased ground disturbances would occur when machine piling and logging activities occur due to the larger number of acres treated. Also, this alternative would remove some dying trees that are currently still green, resulting in additional losses of evapotranspiration with the associated increase in soil saturation and increased landslide potential. This effect is short-term since the trees are currently dying and would stop evapotranspiration within a few years even without treatment. The removal of these dying trees could result in a negligible increase in landslide potential. The creation of new temporary roads (<1 mile) and new landings would have a similar direct effect as stated in the Proposed Alternative. As with Alternative 1, RPMs to protect workers from exposure address the probability of naturally occurring asbestos in rock outcrops, but this alternative would treat more acres within areas that could potentially have naturally occurring asbestos in rock outcrops, which are scattered throughout the project area. Indirect Effects Similarly to Alternative 1, the fuels treatments associated with this alternative would reduce future fire intensity and its associated effects. In addition, this alternative would include fuel breaks which could further reduce fire intensity and fire spread which would more significantly reduce potential future fire impacts on landslide probability. This alternative also includes reforestation which would enhance slope and soil stability through evapotranspiration and root shear strength causing a reduction in landslide potential; however, more trees per acre would be planted under this alternative, reducing landslide potential compared to Alternative 1. Cumulative Effects Cumulative effects for Alternative 2 are similar to the Proposed Action; however, a comparatively small number of dying trees would be removed under this alternative, having the potential to reduce evapotranspiration further, resulting in a cumulative reduction in live vegetation-related evapotranspiration and the associated effects to slope stability. Action Alternative 3: Wider Buffer Alternative (approximately 15,200 acres) Direct Effects Direct effects of Alternative 3 would be similar to Alternative 2, except area of disturbance would increase due to an increase in the number of acres treated (nearly double those of the Proposed Action). Similarly to Alternative 2, Alternative 3 would also remove some dying trees on those treated acres, resulting in a greater reduction in evapotranspiration and root support than Alternative 1. This would result in a negligible increase in landslide potential. Indirect Effects With additional fuels reduction treatments there would be, compared to Alternative 1, a slight decreased risk of future fire severity and associated effects. Cumulative Effects Cumulative effects for Alternative 3 would be similar to Alternative 2, but the scale of project related effects would be larger due to the increased acreage, leading to a potential for larger cumulative effects on reduction of evapotranspiration than Alternative 2. The increased evapotranspiration (and resulting slope stability) due to the planting of trees would be similar to the Proposed Action. Action Alternative 4: Northern Spotted Owl Alternative (approximately 8,000 acres) Direct Effects Alternative 4 would be similar to the Proposed Action, with the same number of acres treated, but fewer salvage logging and fuels reduction treatments on those acres under this alternative. Fewer salvage logging and fuels reduction treatment acres means fewer acres of soil impacts and associated landslide potential. This alternative also only removes dead trees, leaving dying trees; therefore, no reduction in evapotranspiration would occur from this alternative. Indirect Effects Alternative 4 would have similar indirect effects as the Proposed Action. Where fuels reduction treatments are performed, there would be reduced severity for future fires and a potential decrease in landslide probability after future fires; however, this reduction is less than the Proposed Action because the areas identified as important habitat for Northern Spotted Owls would not have fuels reduction treatments. Cumulative Effects Cumulative effects for Alternative 4 would be similar to the Proposed Action given that the acres treated are the same. The increased evapotranspiration (and resulting slope stability) due to the planting of trees would be similar to the Proposed Action. Action Alternative 5: Minimum Impact Alternative (approximately 8,000 acres) Direct Effects Alternative 5 would have less soil disturbance with fewer acres of fuels reduction treatments and no salvage logging. Also, this alternative would only fell dead hazard trees. Dying trees would be left standing; therefore, this alternative would not result in a reduction of evapotranspiration. This alternative results in the least amount of direct effects due to the small number of acres treated. Indirect Effects Alternative 5 would have fewer positive indirect effects due to the fewer acres treated. Where fuels treatments are performed, there would be reduced severity in future fires and thus a potential decrease in landslide probability after future fires; however, the number of acres with fuels reduction treatments is the least under this alternative compared to other alternatives, resulting in the least amount of decrease in landslide potential after future fires. Where areas are left untreated, especially areas with higher fuel loading, the possibility of severity of future fire remains high with the associated increased risk of potential landslides. Cumulative Effects Cumulative effects for Alternative 5 would be similar to the Proposed Action, but would be slightly smaller due to the smaller area treated with fuels reduction and the lack of salvage logging. This alternative results in the least potential for mitigation of fire effects on slope stability through fuels reduction treatments. The increased evapotranspiration (and resulting slope stability) due to the planting of trees would be similar to the Proposed Action. Alternative 6: No Action No vegetation will be treated. Trees and vegetation impacted by the wildfires will continue to decay and fall without human influence. Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects A No-Action Alternative would result in no ground disturbance with no proposed treatments. However, because no timber salvage, hazard tree removal or fuels treatments are proposed in this alternative, there would be an increased likelihood of high severity fires and landslide probability after future fires. The 2015 fires resulted in increased landslide potential due to removal of soil cover and live vegetation, and associated changes in slope hydrology. Implementation of this project has the potential to mitigate some of those fire effects on a relatively small number of acres, but the no action alternative would not implement those treatments, leaving the existing condition of elevated landslide potential. Soils ______________________________________ Methodology The effects of each Alternative on the soil resources of the project area have been assessed using the Soil Quality Standards (SQS) in Appendix O of the Forest Plan. Soil quality standards provide threshold values to identify when changes in soil properties or conditions become detrimental, which would result in significant change or impairment of the productive capacity, hydrologic function or environmental health of the soil. Soil resources have been reviewed using soil survey data, data in GIS, and field reconnaissance (a total of 78 soil descriptions were examined and categorized in the field to verify soil mapping). Most of the treatment units have been field reviewed by the Forest soil scientist to verify mapping, identify areas where soil productivity may be affected by proposed actions, and examine current disturbance on site. Soil ResiliencySoil resiliency refers to the ability of a soil to resist or recover its healthy state in response to destabilizing influences. It is based on the Region 5 Soil Interpretations of 1999 (Miles, 1999). The soil resiliency index rates soils on their ability to resist degradation from disturbance. It is based on a soil’s susceptibility to erosion100, burning, compaction, displacement101, puddling102 and churning103– which are the common soil stressors from timber and fuel reduction operations. Soil resiliency determines what amount of disturbance forest soils can endure before they become less productive due to cumulative effects. The soil resiliency index combines all the soil stress ratings to give an overall resiliency rating to the soil. The soil disturbance rating values listed in Table 3-64 are a numerical range based on combined ratings for soil physical properties. The resiliency rating is for total resiliency of a soil to the combined effects of erosion, burning, compaction, displacement, puddling and churning. Table 3-64. Soil disturbance rating values and Total Resiliency Index. Rating  Erosion  Compaction  Displacement  Burning  Puddling  Resiliency  Low  <65  6-12  6-11  6-11  7-11  141-175  Moderate  66-75  13-19  12-16  12-17  12-16  98-140  High  >75  20-28  17-22  18-25  17-23  <98  Soil StabilityMany land use activities have the potential to cause erosion rates to exceed natural soil erosion or soil formation rates. In order to assess the potential risk of a given soil to erode, an erosion hazard rating (EHR) was developed (R-5 FSH 2509.22). Many interrelated factors are evaluated in an EHR system to determine whether land use activities would cause accelerated erosion. The EHR system is designed to assess the relative risk of accelerated sheet and rill erosion. This rating system is based on soil texture, depth, permeability of soil, amount of rock fragments, surface cover (vegetative and surface rocks), slopes, and climate. Risk ratings vary from low to very high with low ratings meaning low probability of surface erosion occurring. Moderate ratings mean that accelerated erosion is likely to occur in most years and water quality impacts may occur for the upper part of the moderate numerical range. High to very high EHR ratings mean that accelerated erosion is likely to occur in most years and that erosion control 100 Erosion is the detachment, transport, and deposition of soil particles by water, wind, or gravity. 101 Displacement is the removal of topsoil from heavy equipment. 102 Puddling is mixing soil into a watery slurry that removes soil structure. 103 Churning occurs when soil is turned so that topsoil is placed underneath subsoil. measures should be evaluated. These ratings assume varying amounts of vegetation cover depending on degree of fuel management. Vascular plants, soil biotic crusts, and litter cover are the greatest deterrent to surface soil erosion. Visual evidence of surface erosion may include rills, gullies, pedestalling, soil deposition, erosion pavement, or loss of the topsoil104. Erosion models are used to predict on-site and off-site soil loss (water erosion prediction project (WEPP) and/or the erosion hazard rating (EHR). Sufficient soil cover should be maintained to prevent accelerated soil erosion that exceeds the rate of soil formation. Erosion needs to be less than one ton/acre, which equates to an erosion hazard rating in the low range. For granitics, 90% or greater soil cover is necessary. For metasediments, 50 to 70% cover is necessary (Forest Plan, Appendix O). Soil HydrologyCompaction reduces infiltration, increases runoff, which increases erosion hazard ratings and decreases down site water quality. Compaction also decreases porosity, which decreases tree root elongation during critical growing period thus stressing the tree. With stressed trees the stand becomes more likely to develop disease and insect attacks. Soil porosity is the standard to measure compaction, and it puts change on a relative basis per soil type. Soil porosity is the area of the soil matrix that is occupied by voids (micro and macro-pores) that air and water circulate through. The standard for soil porosity is at least 90% of the porosity found under undisturbed or natural conditions. Soil porosity is measured between 4 and 8 inches below the soil surface. A 10 percent reduction in total soil porosity corresponds to a threshold soil bulk density that indicates possible detrimental soil compaction (depending on texture; Forest Plan, Appendix O). Nutrient CyclingNutrient cycling is assessed by evaluating the vegetative community composition, litter, duff, coarse woody material, and root distribution. These indicators are directly related to soil organic matter, which is essential in sustaining long-term soil productivity. Soil organic matter provides a carbon and energy source for soil microbes and provides nutrients needed for plant growth. Organic matter needs to be maintained in kinds and amounts sufficient to prevent significant nutrient cycle deficits, and to avoid detrimental physical and biological soil conditions: • Soil organic matter (dark topsoil layer) in the upper 12 inches of soil should be at least 85 percent of the total soil organic matter (SOM) found under undisturbed or natural conditions. • Fine organic matter should occur on at least 50 percent of the area; this includes duff, litter, and woody material less than three inches in diameter. Fine organic matter left after treatment (surface horizon depth after treatment) should generally be about four to eight tons/acre. • Large woody material, when occurring in the forested area, should be at least 5 logs per acre in contact with the soil surface, and should represent the total range of decomposition (preferably in decay class 3 and 4). The number of logs/acre should be adjusted to account for ecological type potential. • Excessive lateral movement of topsoil from its usual place in the profile should be avoided. Usually areas greater than 20 square meters (15 feet by 15 feet area) and greater than 2 inches of topsoil removed. 104 A rill is a shallow channel caused by erosion. A gully is a deeper channel usually deeper than 1 foot. Pedestalling is a feature left after erosion where rock fragments are left elevated. Soil deposition is sediment deposit below a rill or gully. Erosion pavement is rock fragment surface where fine soil is washed away leaving rock cover. Cumulative Effects To analyze the cumulative effects on soils, the unit of measure used to quantify the effects are the Forest Plan Soil Quality Standards (SQS) developed and adopted in 1995 (FSH 2509.18, R-5 Supplement 2509.18-95-1). These are the appropriate units of measure because they evaluate measurable changes in soil productivity that have been tested and peer reviewed. This cumulative effects analysis quantifies the impact effects as a sum of the direct and indirect impacts of the alternatives considered in addition to the past, present, and foreseeable future actions (which are independent of the alternatives considered). Future foreseeable actions of reforestation and fuel break maintenance are within the soil bounding area. These actions are minor and will not result in significant cumulative impacts to soils. Cumulative soil effects will be evaluated by looking at the effects of dead tree removal and treatment of remaining slash (pile and burn or masticate) along road corridors. The cumulative effects analysis for soils is bounded in space by the area treated in this project. Soil impacts occur to soils in a specific location. Impacts to soils outside of the areas treated for this project are not additive to soil impacts created by this project. The cumulative effects analysis for soils is bounded in time by the amount of time a particular soil is known to recover from disturbance. This time bounding varies depending on soil type; some more sensitive soils take longer to recover from disturbance than less sensitive soils. This bounding ranges from 15 to 30 years for sensitive soils to 5 to 10 years for more resilient soils. Affected Environment Soil Types and ResiliencyMajor soil groupings in the proposed project area include: • Shallow soils include – Chaix, Deadwood, Etsel, Goulding, and Dark Rocky. • Granitic soils include – Chaix, Chanwankee, Hohmann, and Parish. • Ultramafic soils105 include – Beaughton, Dubakella, and Weitchpec. • Fine-textured soils include – Dunsmuir, Forbes, Holland, Hugo, and Secca. • Metamorphic soils include– Neuns, Scree, and Schist Melange.

Shallow soils are susceptible to erosion and displacement. Granitic soils are susceptible to damage by erosion, displacement, and burning. Serpentine soils are susceptible to damage by compaction, puddling and churning. The shallow soils (Goulding, Granitic, Scree, and Shallow Rocky) have the lowest soil resiliency ratings making them very susceptible to disturbance. Soils that have the highest resiliency are Dunsmuir, Forbes, Holland, and Secca, making them less susceptible to disturbance. Refer to Table 4 in the Physical Sciences Report for Resiliency index ratings for major soil types. See Table 2 in the Physical Sciences Report for definition of index ratings. Figure 3-14 Soils map of the River Complex. Figure 3-15 Soils map of the South Complex. Figure 3-16 Soils map of the Saddle Fire. Figure 3-17 Soils map of the Route Complex. Figure 3-18 Soils map of the Fork Complex. Figure 3-19 Soils map of the Mad River Complex. Erosion Soil erosion susceptibility levels are listed by type in Table 5 of the Physical Sciences Report. Soil erosion susceptibility is based on the surface soil texture, how permeable the surface is, the depth to any restrictive layer that would cause ponding, surface rock fragments that could provide cover, the steepness of the slope, soil cover after any disturbance (natural or man-made) and the climate (rainfall or snow amounts). Soils with the highest erosion hazard ratings include Goulding, Granitic soils (Chaix and Chanwankee), Neuns steep, Scree, and Shallow Rocky, which are due to sandy loam textures on steep slopes (60 to 80% slopes). Flat loamy soils (Dunsmuir, Forbes, and Holland) have the lowest erosion hazard ratings due to strong textures and flatter slopes. Serpentine soils (Beaughton and Dubakella) have low to moderate erosion hazard due being moderately deep with cobbles and high clay content. All of the erosion hazard ratings assume a soil cover after disturbance (fuel treatments) of 30 to 50%. CompactionCompaction hazard ratings for the soils in the project area are shown by type in Table 6 of the Physical Sciences Report. Compaction susceptibility is based on surface soil texture, cobble and stones in the subsoil, organic matter in the topsoil and subsoil, depth of litter and duff, and soil structure. Fine-textured soils (Dunsmuir, Forbes, and Secca) have moderately high compaction hazard ratings due to textures (clay loam) and lack of rock fragments in the subsoil. Serpentine soils are cobbly clays with moderately high compaction hazard, moderate puddling hazard, and potential for naturally occurring asbestos (NOA).The rest of the soils (loamy-skeletal, steep rocky serpentines, and sandy soils) in the project area have low to moderate compaction hazard ratings due to soil textures and high rock content. Soil with rock fragments greater than 40%, compaction is only moderate but with rock fragments less than 40% compaction can be severe depending on texture. Studies have shown that rock fragments greater than 40% act as a matrix or skeleton that resists compressive forces (Powers and Alves, 1995; Gomez and Powers 2004; Liechty and others, 2002; Rust 2004). Soil compaction is not of great concern on most of the soils within the project area since most soils have rock content greater than 40%. DisplacementDisplacement susceptibility is based on soil texture and structure, surface organic matter, litter and duff thickness, bulk density, and cohesion ability. Most soils in this project have moderate displacement susceptibility, with the shallow soils having high displacement ratings due to being shallow and lacking soil strength (Table 7 – Physical Sciences Report). Since most roots are in the upper 1 to 2 feet of soil, it is very important to protect topsoil from displacement and puddling, especially for the Goulding, Granitic, Scree, and Shallow Rocky soils since they are the most sensitive soils within the project. BurningBurning susceptibility is based on topsoil organic matter, coarse fragments in the topsoil, texture and kind of weathered rock, and slope. Project area soils have a moderate to low risk of being degraded by fire, except for Dark Rocky, Granitic, Scree, and Shallow Rocky soils – which have a moderately high risk of damage from burning due to their coarse textures (Table 8-Physical Sciences Report). Across all fires, there was an average of 28% moderate to high soil burn severity and 72% low to very low soil burn severity. In areas where soils were burned at moderate to high intensity, soil structure was destroyed, soil cover was removed, and water repellency was common. Since the highly burned landscapes (where most of the salvage will occur) lack cover, returning as much cover as possible during implementation is desirable. This technique was used recently for the Stafford Fire Salvage Project of 2013 (Figure 3-20 and Figure 3-21below). Cover was maximized as much as possible in areas that burned hot and soil cover was marginal. Techniques of lop-and-scatter and mastication of dead un-merchantable material was utilized to return cover to the ground and slow erosion. Immediate cover was needed to protect severely burned soils from accelerated erosion and the loss of important nutrients that are held in the duff and organic matter in the surface horizons. Additionally, salvage breaks up water repellant surface layers and provides a surface roughness factor that reduces erosion (James, K. 2013). Dr. James found salvage logging that use ground-based tractors roughen the topsoil to break up water repellency and reduce erosion by loosening the topsoil layer and creating a roughness factor. Figure 3-20 Stafford Fire Salvage soil cover pre  Figure 3-21 Stafford Fire Salvage soil cover post- and post-harvest.  harvest.  Pre-harvest soil cover conditions – 20 to 35%  Post-harvest soil cover conditions – 35 to 60%  cover inadequate soil cover to prevent erosion  cover providing effective soil cover  With prescribed fire, most soil burning is low to moderate in a mosaic pattern, leaving greater than 50% duff and litter (less than 3 inches in diameter). Deadwood, Neuns, Goulding, Dunsmuir, Forbes, Holland, Secca, Serpentines, and Wetland have low soil burning damage susceptibility due to their finer textures that resist heat penetration; the rest of the soils are moderate with the exception of Dark Rocky and Shallow Rocky soils that rate as severe. PuddlingPuddling hazard is the susceptibility of the soil to puddling based on soil properties. Puddling is the destruction of soil aggregates by mechanical manipulation within a narrow range of moisture contents above and below field capacity, so that soil aggregates lose their structure, resulting in a homogeneous mass of soil particles. Puddling is shown by soil type in Table 9 of the Physical Sciences Report, which shows that most of the soils in the project area are have a low to moderate susceptibility to puddling. Soil FertilitySoil fertility in the project area is high to moderately low depending upon the parent material formation, soil texture, and available water holding capacity (Table 10-Physical Sciences Report), Loamy soils (Forbes, and Holland) have the highest soil fertility due to their depth and available water-holding capacities (AWC). Serpentine soils (Beaughton and Dubakella) have moderately low soil fertility due to their parent rock type (chemical imbalance) and moderate AWC. In general, most soils that are suitable for growing timber have low fertility, and most nutrients are recycled from decomposing roots and surface duff that gets incorporated into the soil. Desired Condition. The desired condition is to maintain or restore soils to their natural productivity. Recovery time varies for soil burn severity experienced. For moderate to high soil burn severity, soil recovery will take five to fifteen years. For low to very low soil burn severity, soil recovery will take three to five years. Maintaining soil productivity over the long term generally requires presence of soil organic material and fire effects characteristic of the natural fire regime. Effects Analysis The extent (geographic boundaries) of this soils analysis is the project bounding area of the Proposed Action and each of the alternatives. Soil Quality Standards only apply to the affected soils in regards to erosion, compaction, and fertility within the project area. The duration of the soils analysis is fifteen years from the time of implementation. Typical erosion recovery rates for soils with 50 to 70% cover is three to five years for areas of very low to low soil burn severity, and ten to fifteen years for areas of moderate to high soil burn severity (as determined from the Universal Soil Loss Equation). Alternative 1 (Proposed Action) Direct Effects Direct effects of the Proposed Action on the soil ecosystem are primarily soil disturbance, redistribution of organic matter, and changes in biological properties. Tree falling by hand or mechanical means along roads could cause minor compaction or soil displacement, depending on the soil type and slope. Compaction caused by tree removal will be minimal since most heavy mechanical equipment will be operating from the road. Soil cover will be improved by about 15 to 35% by lopping-and-scattering tree tops and limbs (Rust, 2015). Soil RPMs (see Chapter 2) will minimize impacts to the landscape. Compaction will be reduced by tilling and mulching landings, temporary roads, and main skid-trails up to 200 feet from landings. Hazard tree treatments plus mechanical harvesting plus fuel reduction treatments plus fuel maintenance in 10 to 15 years could have direct effects on some of the more sensitive soils. The soil RPMs will insure that their productivity will be protected and not compromised. Soil Cover/Erosion Current soil cover conditions are 10 to 50% (depending on soil burn severity), so increasing effective soil cover (masticating or lop and scatter) by 10 to 30% would have positive soil effects (Figure 3-20 and Figure 3-21, MacDonald, 2003). Additional soil cover would help curb the effects from future winter storms. Tree planting will also provide cover and reduce erosion. Soil Compaction Dunsmuir, Holland, and Forbes soils have high soil compaction hazard ratings (Table 6-Physical Sciences Report). These three soils occupy most of flatter, less rocky landscapes in the area (Figure 3-14 through Figure 3-19). Operations would primarily be on the road prism, so compaction will be insignificant since roads are already compacted and are not productive timberland but part of the infrastructure and exempt from the National Forest Management Act regulations. About 40% of the areas logged in the past have low to moderate level of soil disturbance, with compaction (4 to 7% decrease in porosity) and displacement well below the soil quality standards for extent and severity. With the RPMs, expected compaction from mechanical operations will only increase by an average of 2 to 4% on 40% of the unit, leaving about 60% undisturbed and well below SQS thresholds for compaction and extent of disturbance. Soil RPMs also include a dry operating season with only restricted wet weather operations to ensure soils are dry enough to reduce damage due to compaction from mechanical operations (see Chapter 2). Indirect Effects Indirect effects on the soil ecosystem are secondary reactions to direct effects. The most common secondary reactions are erosion caused by increased surface runoff due to compaction, reduced available water-holding capacity of the soil due to water repellency or compaction, reduction in fertility due to removal of cover, and reduced vegetative growth due to compaction. Additional soil cover will reduce erosion of critical topsoil and increase soil fertility by returning all available fine slash (less than 3 inch woody material) which contains a large proportion of recyclable nutrients that are beneficial to soil health and productivity (Rust, 2015; Busse and others, 2014). Increases in the amount of soil cover from lop and scatter and mastication treatments would reduce erosion. Hillside erosion calculations (untreated vs. treated) and road erosion calculations (before implementation, during implementation, and after implementation) indicate that the average erosion reduction for Alternative 1 vs. No Action, is 4 tons/acre for untreated and 2 tons/acre for treated (Tables 11 and 12 of the Physical Sciences Report). For roads, erosion increases from 7.5 tons/mile to 13.6 tons/mile during harvest, and after harvest it drops back to background levels of 7.5 tons/mile. Hillside sediment reduction is due to more cover after treatment. Tree removal by hand falling and skidding or mechanical treatments (machine-piling and mastication) could cause some soil disturbance which would result in erosion depending on the soil type and slopes. Erosion will be addressed by soil RPMs, (see Chapter 2) that retain as much available cover as possible, and can be increased where cover is lacking through lop and scatter of retained woody debris or mastication. Erosion will be minimized by keeping mechanical equipment on roads where possible, minimizing dragging of logs, and using existing skid-trails and landings. Tilling and mulching landings and main skid-trails up to 200 feet from landings will address compaction, erosion, and increase available soil moisture. Water-barring all skid-trails will reduce erosion. Soil Fertility The topsoil in the areas in this project that burned at high and moderate severity often sustained damage. For these reasons remaining topsoil is protected from displacement and compaction in the project RPMs. Minimizing displacement and puddling in shallow soils will protect topsoil. Dark Rocky soils have subsoil nutrient deficiencies. Total soil resiliency shows Dark Rocky, Goulding, Granitic, Scree, and Shallow Rocky soils as having the lowest resistance to damage from disturbance due to depth and textures (Table 4 – Physical Science Report and Figure 3-14 through Figure 3-19). These soils have RPMs to insure that their soil productivity will not be compromised. Burning Soils were damaged during the 2015 fires and soil cover was reduced. Recruitment of woody debris from available salvage slash or hazard tree falling and treating of fuels (branches and tree tops) by lop-andscatter or mastication would mitigate some of these fire effects. The increased soil cover should help to curb erosion and provide for soil nutrient return and retention of soil carbon. (Rust 2015, Uselman 2012). Conclusions Soil effects of salvage logging, lop-and-scatter, machine piling, hand pile & burn and mastication are listed in Table 3-66. Table 3-66. Project treatment effects on soil. Treatment  Effects on Soil  Salvage logging  Increased soil cover due to breakage of trees and braches along with fine slash. Also increased soil roughness to break up water repellency and increase soil infiltration along with reducing erosion.  Lop & scatter to 18 inches  3 to 10 inch diameter material provides soil cover, breaks down rapidly into fine litter and slow incorporation of nutrients.  Machine pile & burn  Possible topsoil displacement and compaction but if done when soils are dry and using a brush-rake, effects are minimized. Concentrations can burn hot if piles are large with large logs, but are typically only spotty and create mosaic burn patterns.  Hand pile & burn  Small concentrated piles, decompose more slowly, concentrations can burn hot if piles are large with large logs, but are typically only spotty and create mosaic burn patterns.  Jackpot burn  Concentrated areas of fuel consumed can be hot but are limited on the landscape, are mosaic, and do not increase overland erosion.  Mastication  Fuel rearrangement. Increased soil cover, temperature, moisture and microbe activity. Possible short-term Carbon/Nitrogen imbalance if too much material is incorporated into soil.  Treatment  Effects on Soil  Broadcast burn  In unburned areas it can be effective in reducing fuels by creating mosaic burns that leaves adequate soil cover while reducing fuel loads. This treatment would only be used initially in areas that have high soil cover and high levels of woody debris; available woody debris and soil cover will be retained in areas that burned at high severity.  With soil RPMs in place, there will be only minor impacts on soils within the soil resource bounding area (treatment units). Impacts to soils are within the Shasta-Trinity Land and Resource Management Plan Soil Quality Standards thresholds. This project will maintain soil productivity, and will adequately protect soils from erosion, compaction, burning and displacement. Cumulative Effects By focusing on the soil quality standards and considering past, present, proposed, and future activities, cumulative effects can be evaluated for each alternative within the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project treatment units. See Chapter 3 in the EIS for a complete list of all past, present, and future actions within Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project area. Because the resource analysis bounding for soils is the areas directly impacted by the project (the road buffers), there are minor foreseeable future actions in the soils analysis area (reforestation and fuel break maintenance but these actions are minor and are not significant cumulative impacts to soils); however, the fires had negative impacts on soils in the analysis area and have been included in this cumulative effects analysis. With mitigations and erosion control measures implemented with this project, cumulative erosion will be slightly elevated but will go to background levels after 5 to 10 years. This is shown with the WEPP erosion rates (Table 14-Physical Sciences Report), which shows calculated surface erosion rates (WEPP erosion model)108 for predevelopment conditions, severe wildfire, and post-harvest recovery rates. Erosion from severe wildfire for typical soils within the project area (Neuns – rocky soil, and Holland – fine-textured soil) are both very high. However, if the sites’ available slash component and the soil surface roughness coefficient are increased (similar to green tree removal treatments – GTR), then soil erosion is significantly reduced (30 to 40 tons/acre of erosion for untreated burned areas down to 2 to 6 tons/acre of erosion for treated areas). Untreated skid-trails have high erosion rates (25 to 40 tons/acre of erosion), but when water-barred and mulched, soil erosion is again significantly reduced (0.5 to 1 ton/acre). The same holds true for landings that are bare (1 ton/acre) vs. mulched (<0.5 tons/acre). Hillside erosion of salvage logging and thinning are generally minimal due to adequate logging slash. The main areas where erosion is of concern are roads and skid-trails. With proper erosion control, these effects can be mitigated and reduced to acceptable levels. The increased soil cover from treatments may slightly mitigate some of the fire impacts, but these effects would be minor compared to the large footprint of the fire that would not be treated. Alternative 2 Direct Effects Effects are similar to Alternative 1 except on a larger scale (~9,500 acres) and a set treatment distance (150 feet on either side) instead of a variable treatment width and strategic fuelbreaks on certain road segments (1200 feet total width, 600 on either side of the road). This alternative will utilize two miles of unauthorized roads as temporary roads, and create one mile of new temporary roads. Old unauthorized roads have had time to partially recover by trees growing on them, and soils being partially decompacted 108 The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) soil erosion model was developed by an interagency group of scientists including the USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Natural Resources Conservation Service, Forest Service, the Dept. of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management and US Geological Survey. Scientists from these agencies throughout the United States have been working since 1985 to develop this erosion prediction model to replace the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) for various land management activities (timber harvesting, roads, grazing, fuel reduction plans, prescribed fire and wildfire). over time by tree roots. Any recovery will be halted with additional displacement for newer larger equipment and increased compaction, resetting the recovery process. Also, new temporary roads will be created displacing and compacting soils. The larger fuelbreaks will create an additional 16 miles of possible mechanical thinning that could cause additional erosion, displacement, compaction and puddling off the main roads. The use of unauthorized roads and creation of new temporary roads is acceptable according to the Forest Plan as long as no more than 15% of the harvest unit is dedicated to non-productive purposes such as roads, skid-trails, and landings (Forest Plan, page 4-25). Soil RPMs of subsoiling and mulching temporary roads will address this issue along with other impacts to soils from mechanical thinning and burning similar to Alternative 1. With adherence to the soil RPMs, direct impacts will be minor and nonsignificant. Burned areas that will be treated are areas where trees are dead and most soil cover has been removed by the fire. In these areas, soil cover replacement would slow erosion and preserve the topsoil (Figure 3-20 and Figure 3-21). Unburned and lightly burned areas that will be treated by thinning (in the fuelbreaks) and mastication, machine piling or hand treatments, and burning; preservation of existing soil cover and topsoil will occur as part of the RPMs. Benefits of prescribed burning include return of nutrients to the soil while providing adequate cover due to low burn severity. Adhering to the soil RPMs will insure all available soil cover will be utilized to protect critical topsoil. Soils susceptible to compaction, displacement, puddling and burning will be protected by soil RPMs (see Appendix D of the Soils Section of the Physical Sciences Report for the Resource Protection Measures specific to soil resources). Indirect Effects The effects regarding erosion are similar to the Proposed Action due to the lack of cover from the fires and compaction from mechanical operations. Besides compaction creating more overland flow and erosion, less water penetrates the soil which reduces available water holding capacity. These effects will be minimized by adherence to the RPMs described in Chapter 2. Increases in the amount of soil cover from lop and scatter and mastication treatments would reduce erosion. The average amount of erosion reduction for this alternative vs. no action, is 4 tons/acre for untreated areas and 2 tons/acre for treated areas. For roads, it increases from 7.5 tons/mile to 13.6 tons/mile during harvest, and after harvest it drops back to background levels. Hillside sediment reduction due to more cover after treatment is 40% (Table 11-Physical Sciences Report). These positive soil effects would occur over a larger area than the Proposed Action due to the larger area treated under this alternative. Cumulative Effects Direct and indirect effects of this alternative are similar to Alternative 1 with the exception of increased temporary roads and additional fuel breaks. These additive direct and indirect effects are minor when combined with the effects of the fire. The increased soil cover from treatments may slightly mitigate some of the fire impacts, but these effects would be minor compared to the large footprint of the fire that would not be treated. There are minor foreseeable future actions in the soils analysis area (reforestation and fuel break maintenance) but these actions are minor and are not significant cumulative impacts to soils. In the long-term reforestation will provide additional soil stabilization benefits. Alternative 3 Direct Effects Direct effects of Alternative 3 will have the potential for greater impacts to soils over Alternatives 1 and 2. Soil effects will be similar to Alternative 1 except a larger footprint would be treated due to the larger roadside buffer. Hazard tree treatments plus mechanical harvesting plus fuel reduction treatments plus fuel maintenance in 10 to 15 years could have direct effects on some of the more sensitive soils (see Alternative 1 for a discussion of the sensitive soil types). These soils will have soil RPMs to insure that their productivity will be protected and not compromised Alternative 3 could cause more erosion, compaction, displacement, and puddling than Alternatives 1 and 2 due to the larger footprint for mechanical equipment operations off the main road, especially temporary roads. Additional displacement and compaction would occur, requiring sub-soiling and mulching as per the soil RPMs. This larger treatment area in severely burned landscapes that already lacks soil cover will be more prone to erosion than Alternatives 1 and 2. Indirect Effects This alternative could cause more compaction and overland flow due to the larger footprint of treatments, leading to more erosion and less water infiltration into the soil. More temporary roads will lead to more displacement of topsoil and reduced fertility of the soils. To minimize these effects, adherence to the soil RPMs will be required. Increases in the amount of soil cover from lop and scatter and mastication treatments would reduce erosion. The average amount of erosion reduction for this alternative vs. no action, is 4 tons/acre for untreated and 2 tons/acre for treated (Figure 3-20 and Figure 3-21). For roads it increases from 7.5 tons/mile to 13.6 tons/mile during harvest, and after harvest it drops back to background. Hillside sediment reduction due to more cover after treatment is 40% (Table 11-Physical Sciences Report). These positive soil effects would occur over a larger area than Alternatives 1 and 2 due to the larger area treated under this alternative. Cumulative Effects Direct and indirect effects of this alternative are similar to Alternative 1 with the exception of increased temporary roads and area treated. These additive direct and indirect effects are minor when combined with the effects of the fire. The increased soil cover from treatments may slightly mitigate some of the fire impacts, but these effects would be minor compared to the large footprint of the fire that would not be treated. There are minor foreseeable future actions in the soils analysis area (reforestation and fuel break maintenance) but these actions are minor and are not significant cumulative impacts to soils. In the longterm reforestation will provide additional soil stabilization benefits. Alternative 4 Direct Effects This alternative reduces direct impacts to soils compared to Alternatives 1-3 due to the reduced area of mechanical disturbance. Acres providing important habitat for the northern spotted owl would only have hazard trees felled and not removed. Along with providing soil cover, nutrients in the felled trees will be in direct contact with the soil hastening the return of nutrients to the soil. The project RPMs will ensure that these soils and their productivity will be protected and not compromised. Outside of sensitive NSO locations, treatments would be the same as Alternative 1 except on a smaller scale. In areas harvested, the combination of hazard tree treatments plus mechanical harvesting plus fuel reduction treatments plus fuel maintenance in 10 to 15 years could have direct effects on some of the more sensitive soils, but these impacts will be less than Alternatives 1-3 due to reductions in areas treated. Treatment effects will be minimized by adherence to the soil RPMs. Indirect Effects Areas treated with hazard tree felling only will be more prone to destructive wildfires in the future. This could negatively affect soils if they are burned at high intensity, further reducing their productivity. This would cause additional water-repellency, especially in granitic soils, which would lead to increased overland flows and erosion. These areas will be even more susceptible to high intensity fire over time due to brush growing between felled trees, further heightening high severity fire hazards. Increases in the amount of soil cover from lop and scatter, mastication, and hazard tree felling would reduce erosion (Figure 3-20 and Figure 3-21). The average amount of erosion reduction for this alternative vs. no action, is 4 tons/acre for untreated and 2 tons/acre for treated. For roads it increases from 7.5 tons/mile to 13.6 tons/mile during harvest, and after harvest it drops back to background. Hillside sediment reduction due to more cover after treatment is 40% (Table 11-Physical Sciences Report). Indirect effects of erosion due to displacement and compaction will be less than the Proposed Action due to fewer timber harvest acres and reduced fuel reduction treatments. Less displacement and compaction reduces impacts, but because these areas are already burned, increased soil cover from treatments is an important tool for reducing erosion. With fewer thinning and mastication acres, fewer acres of increased soil cover will be realized. The most sensitive soils (Dark Rocky, Goulding, Granitic, Scree, and Shallow Rocky soils) will be protected and not compromised by adhering to the RPMs, any indirect impacts will be minor and nonsignificant for this alternative. Cumulative Effects Direct and indirect effects of this alternative are similar to Alternative 1 with the exception of reduced timber harvest and fuels reduction treatments. These additive direct and indirect effects are minor when combined with the effects of the fire. The increased soil cover from treatments may slightly mitigate some of the fire impacts, but these effects would be minor compared to the large footprint of the fire that would not be treated. There are minor foreseeable future actions in the soils analysis area (reforestation and fuel break maintenance) but these actions are minor and are not significant cumulative impacts to soils. In the long-term reforestation will provide additional soil stabilization benefits. Alternative 5 Direct Effects With this alternative, there will be fewer direct impacts to soils than any of the other alternatives. This alternative includes no salvage and fuels reduction treatments would only occur outside of Riparian Reserves, Inventoried Roadless Areas, At-Risk Watersheds, and important NSO habitat. In areas with hazard tree felling only, along with providing soil cover, nutrients in the felled trees will be in direct contact with the soil hastening the return of nutrients to the soil. This alternative only treats hazard trees and fuels, so there will be very little impact to the soils except in fuel treatment zones. Fuel treatment options vary depending on the site, but the goal is to increase soil cover by using available woody material(Figure 3-20 and Figure 3-21). Direct impacts to soils include masticating,  hand-piling and pile burning, then later maintenance burning. With adherence to soil RPMs only minor impacts to soils will be realized. Minor direct and indirect effects from this alternative are well below SQS listed in the Forest Plan. Areas outside of the sensitive areas mentioned above will have fuel reduction treatments including mastication, hand-piling, chipping, or future broadcast burning. The direct effects of this alternative will be less than the effects of the other alternatives due to the lack of salvage and the smaller scale of fuels reduction treatments. Impacts of current treatments and future treatments (such as maintenance burning) will be minimized by application of the RPMs. Indirect Effects Areas with only hazard tree felling treatments will be more prone to high severity fires in the future. This could affect soils by burning them at high intensity and further reducing their productivity. This would cause additional water-repellency especially in granitic soils, which would lead to increased overland flows. Increases in the amount of soil cover from lop and scatter, mastication, and hazard tree felling would reduce erosion. The average amount of erosion reduction for this alternative vs. no action, is 4 tons/acre for untreated and 2 tons/acre for treated. For roads it increases from 7.5 tons/mile to 13.6 tons/mile during harvest, and after harvest it drops back to background. Hillside sediment reduction due to more cover after treatment is 40% (Table 11-Physical Sciences Report). Cumulative Effects Direct and indirect effects of this alternative are similar to Alternative 1 with the exception of no timber harvest related effects and fewer acres of fuels reduction treatments. These additive direct and indirect effects are minor when combined with the effects of the fire. The increased soil cover from treatments may slightly mitigate some of the fire impacts, but these effects would be minor compared to the large footprint of the fire that would not be treated. There are minor foreseeable future actions in the soils analysis area (reforestation and fuel break maintenance) but these actions are minor and are not significant cumulative impacts to soils. In the long-term reforestation will provide additional soil stabilization benefits. Alternative 6 (No Action) Direct and Indirect Effects Under the No Action Alternative, no fuel reduction or hazard tree treatments would be implemented to accomplish project goals. There would be no new disturbance resulting from forest management activities, and existing disturbance would persist. No new adverse effects would result from this action but in some locations productivity potential in the short term may not be as high under this alternative as compared to the action alternatives because past disturbance (fire and storm damage) would not be alleviated through increases in soil cover. Hydrologic function, such as soil drainage, would be maintained at existing rates. Under the No Action Alternative, the remaining forest canopy would not be altered and remaining organic material covering the soil would not be disturbed by management. Soil cover standards would continue to not be met and the litter/duff layer would very slowly increase over time. As a result, erosion hazards would likely remain high due to lack of effective cover on the ground. Coarse woody debris levels would increase over time as fire-killed trees fall. The probability of a high-severity fire within the project area during a given timeframe is unpredictable. However, when a fire breaks out, the chances for high-severity fire effects on soils can be much higher in areas with excessively heavy fuel loads compared to those that have been treated (Certini, 2005; Cram and others, 2006; Gorman, 2003; Keane and others, 2002). Monitoring of prescribed fire after the fires of 2008 showed the benefits of treating fuels with prescribed fire and their effects on soil vs. untreated fuels and wildfire effects on soil (Rust, 2010). Future high-intensity wildfire would increase the potential for additional impacts to soils and soil productivity in areas that were severely burned in 2015, especially since the risk of soil erosion increases proportionally with fire intensity (Megahan, 1990). Other effects would include the additional loss of organics, loss of nutrients, and reduced water infiltration (Wells et al. 1979). Fires that create very high soil surface temperatures, particularly when soil moisture content is low, almost completely destroy soil microbial populations, woody debris, and the protective duff and litter layer over mineral soil (Hungerford, 1991; Neary and others, 2005). Nutrients stored in the organic layer (such as potassium and nitrogen) can also be lost or reduced through volatilization and as fly ash (DeBano, 1991; Amaranthus and others, 1989). Fire-induced soil hydrophobicity is presumed to be a primary cause of the observed post-fire increases in runoff and erosion from forested watersheds (Huffman and others, 2001). Though hydrophobicity is a naturally occurring phenomenon that can be found on the mineral soil surface, it is greatly amplified by increased burn severity (Neary and others, 2005). The storms of 2012 in the Bagley fire caused extensive sheet and rill erosion six to twelve inches deep due to water repellency at that depth (Rust, 2013). Soil hydrophobicity usually returns to pre-burn conditions in no more than six years (DeBano, 1981). Dyrness (1976) and other studies have documented a much more rapid recovery of one to three years (Huffman and others, 2001). The persistence of a hydrophobic layer depends on the strength and extent of hydrophobic chemicals after burning and the many physical and biological factors that can aid in breakdown (DeBano, 1981). This variability means that post-fire impacts on watershed conditions are difficult to predict and to quantify. In the case of the fires that burned during 2015 in this project area, two to three years water repellency is expected due to the higher elevations in the burned area. In the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Salvage Project case, the areas to be treated are the areas that had moderate to severe vegetative burn severity. With this project, these burned areas would be beneficially impacted by increased soil cover to reduce erosion from foreseeable winter storms in the next two to five years; these beneficial effects would not be realized under this alternative. Cumulative Effects Because there are no direct or indirect effects of the No Action Alternative, there are no cumulative effects; however, increasing coarse woody debris over time from fire killed trees could result in additional high intensity wildfires which would cumulatively negatively impact soils that have already been damaged by fire. Soils and Climate ChangeClimate change is responsible for major ecological changes such as: 1) decreased snowpack; 2) increasing rains; 3) increasing temperatures; 4) vegetative shifts to higher elevations; 5) lower elevation vegetation taking over higher elevation ranges and extending its range. These shifts are causing changes in soil respiration due to different vegetation and microbial populations that are exacerbated by wildfires, urban sprawl, and management of fuel (thinning, clearcuts, mastication, and burning). All of these factors can cause a shift of soil carbon by shifting vegetation types that influence soil microbes with different carbon sequestrating rates and abilities. To say one fuels project does not contribute any significant amount of CO2 is like saying a car does not contribute any significant amount of CO2 gas to the atmosphere. But millions of cars are a different story. The same could be said with all of the fuel projects on the forest, the state, and across the nation, they add up cumulatively and do have an effect on the CO2 levels and the soil carbon pools.  Yes, we need to reduce the fuels to reduce catastrophic effects of wildfires. But we also need to do it in a controlled incremental way and we also need to acknowledge the small but cumulative effects of doing so. Soils are the largest pool of organic carbon, which is essential for mitigating and adapting to climate change. In an era of water scarcity, soils are fundamental for its appropriate storage and distribution. The soils of the world, with the biota they support, are major absorbers, depositories, and releasers of organic carbon. Soils altogether contain an estimated 1,700 Gt (billion metric tons) to a depth of 1 meter and as much as 2,400 Gt to a depth of 2 meters. An estimated additional 560 Gt is contained in terrestrial biota (plants and animals). In contrast, the carbon in the atmosphere is estimated to total 750 Gt. Thus, the amount of organic carbon in soils is more than four times the amount of carbon in terrestrial biota and three times that in the atmosphere. The content of organic carbon in soils in most cases constitutes less than 5% of the mass of soil material and is generally concentrated mainly in the upper 20 to 40 cm (the so-called topsoil). What processes release soil carbon from sequestration? Well, anything that disrupts soil structure such as tillage, compaction, and erosion are a disruption of soil structure. Increases in soil temperature can release soil carbon from sequestration. Soil degradation (resulting from burning of vegetative cover, tillage, erosion, leaching, pollution, compaction, salination, and/or other processes) diminishes the capacity of soils to fully recover their original state. The potential of soils to sequester carbon is intimately associated with the content and nature of their clay fraction. Sandy soils, which tend to be well aerated and have little adsorptive capacity, generally retain little organic matter. Clayey soils, on the other hand, form strong physicochemical bonds between the active surfaces of the clay particles and the organic macromolecules of humus, which thus become resistant to further decay. Moreover, clayey soils tend to form tight water-resistant aggregates, the interiors of which restrict aeration and further resist the decay of occluded organic matter. Whenever soil aggregates are disrupted by mechanical tillage, soil structure is prone to deteriorate and soil organic matter tends to decompose more rapidly. Granitic sandy soils occur in various plutonic bodies (around 20% of the area) in the project treatment units (see soils maps). The rest are loamy to clayey soils with high levels of soil organic matter (SOM). Soil resources protection measures will protect sensitive granitic soils from degradation and reduce the loss of SOM from the topsoil. Decayed downed large woody debris (LWD) provide little soil carbon but are hubs for mycorrhizal fungi since LWD that is decayed and rotten and has high moisture holding capacity due to brown rot (high in lignin that holds water) Busse, 1994, SSAJ. Spears et al 2003 CJFR, found decayed organic C and N leachates higher under decaying logs but soil C or N was not higher than control plots that lacked LWD and gross N mineralization was higher in open areas. Powers et al 1994 found mycorrhizal root tips in soil and brown rot in LWD was about twice the density but soil carbon and N levels in the soil below LWD was less than areas adjacent to LWD. They showed decayed LWD contributes little to soil carbon or nitrogen and most of it was used by the mycorrhizal fungi to grow. This does have an indirect benefit to adjacent trees since mycorrhizal fungi do help tree extend their ability to extract minerals from the soil for their growth. Microbial communities feed off the organic matter, duff, litter, and decaying roots that make carbon available for plant uptake and storage. Yes logging can raise soil temperatures by reducing canopy and in some cases (most notably in clearcuts) increase soil respiration. Clearcut units are limited in this project with most of the treatments as thinning so soil efflux rates (CO2 release) will be much less. During the winter so little respiration will happen and during the spring it will spike and decreases into the summer through the fall due to low soil moisture. So any significant contribution happens in spikes (bursts) due to warm moist soils (spring conditions). So overall contributions will be sporadic and very low for the whole project. In comparison to the areas that burned this project only represents a small contribution to soil efflux.  Climate change to soils within this project is not expected to change soil carbon pools significantly and is not an issue for the size of this project in comparison to the larger fire scars and the RPM’s being implemented. Botany ____________________________________ Background Categories of Botanical Species of Concern Current management direction requires conservation of several categories of plants on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Threatened and Endangered species are those listed and protected under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Forest Service Manual 2670 (eff. 9/23/2005) provides direction for conservation and recovery of threatened and endangered species. There are no federally listed threatened or endangered plant species on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Appendix A-1of the Botany Biological Evaluation provides the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife list of known or potential Threatened and Endangered botanical species from the proposed project area (04/27/2016 extract). Hoover’s spurge (Euphorbia hooveri syn. Chamaesyce hooveri), Mcdonald’s rock cress (Arabis mcdonaldiana) and slender orcutt grass (Orcuttia tenuis) are identified as having potential to be present within the project area, but there are no documented populations of any of the species and all grow in geographic regions that are not similar to those in Trinity County or in the project area. Sensitive species are those vascular plant, bryophyte, lichen, and fungi species, of whose viability is of concern. Field surveys to determine if populations are present in a proposed project area are encouraged, but not required by law, regulation, or policy. Direction for protection and management of Sensitive species is provided in Forest Service Manual 2670. Sensitive species will be protected from management actions to avoid a loss of viability and prevent a trend toward federal listing. The Region 5 Sensitive Plant List was updated and signed by the Regional Forester on July 3, 2013. Sensitive species known from the west side of the Forest are identified in Appendix A-2 of the Botany Biological Evaluation and analyzed in the Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences sections of this document. Appendix A-2 of the Botany Biological Evaluation assesses the potential for individual Sensitive species to be present within the project area based on a variety of factors, including habitat characteristics, geographic location, elevation, plant community composition, soil mineralogy and characteristics, and water. Forest Plan Endemic species are species confined wholly or mostly to the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. These species are not currently on the Regional Forester’s Sensitive species list, but are afforded the same protection as Sensitive species by direction in the Shasta-Trinity Land and Resource Management Plan (USDA, 1995). If present within a project area, these species are addressed in the Botany Evaluation in Appendix B-1, Botany Specialist Report, Forest Plan Endemic Species. Survey and Manage species are rare or uncommon species associated with late-seral conifer forest habitat and are designated on the 2001 Record of Decision and Standards and Guidelines for Amendments to the Survey and Manage, Protection Buffer, and other Mitigation Measures, Standards and Guidelines (USDA, 2001a). Most recently, the designated species list was updated to reflect results of Annual Species Reviews up to 2003. These species are to be managed to avoid significantly negative impacts to their habitat or persistence on individual sites and management requirements are somewhat different than those for Sensitive species. Survey and Manage species are addressed in the Botany Evaluation in Appendix B-2, Botany Specialist Report, Survey and Manage Species. Noxious Weeds are invasive, non-native plant species that threaten ecosystem integrity and the health of native plant communities. Forest Service Manual FSM 2080 and the 2001 Northern Province Noxious and Invasive Weeds Program Strategy (USDA, 2001b) provide direction for management of noxious weeds, including a risk assessment for all proposed actions. Noxious weeds are addressed in the Botany Evaluation in Appendix B-4, Botany Specialist Report, Noxious Weed Risk Assessment. Authorities: Direction and PolicySeveral laws, regulations, and policies describe requirements and recommendations for developing proposed action to insure they won’t harm protected botanical species enough to warrant listing them as threatened or endangered. These include direction for conducting environmental analysis and designing proposed actions to minimize harm to protected botanical species. Authorities related to botany are shown below. Forest Service Manual 2670 Threatened, Endangered, and Sensitive Plants and Animals (FSM 2670). FSM 2670.11. Section 5 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, directs the Secretary of Agriculture to "establish and implement a program to conserve fish, wildlife, and plants," including federally listed species. FSM 2670.12. Forest Service departmental regulation 9500-4directs the Forest Service to: 2.Conduct activities and programs "to assist in the identification and recovery of threatened and endangered plant and animal species." 3. Avoid actions "which may cause a species to become threatened or endangered." FSM 2670.22. Sensitive Species 1. Develop and implement management practices to ensure that species do not become threatened or endangered because of Forest Service actions. 2.Maintain viable populations of all native and desired nonnative wildlife, fish, and plant species in habitats distributed throughout their geographic range on National Forest System lands. 3.Develop and implement management objectives for populations and/or habitat of Sensitive species. FSM 2670.32 Sensitive Species 2. Review programs and activities as part of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 process through a biological evaluation, to determine their potential effect on Sensitive species. 3. Avoid or minimize impacts to species whose viability has been identified as a concern. 4. Analyze, if impacts cannot be avoided, the significance of potential adverse effects on the population or its habitat within the area of concern and on the species as a whole.

If monitoring results show a decline in species viability, alter management strategy. Summary of Management Area Direction Management Area 14-New River/North Fork/Canyon Creek.Canyon Creek stonecrop is identified as potentially being present. Currently, populations of five Sensitive species are known from Management Area 14. No specific management direction or supplemental management direction is provided for Sensitive plants. Management Area 15-Trinity River. No specific management direction or supplemental management direction is provided for Sensitive plants. At the time of Forest Plan publication no Sensitive plants were documented here, but currently populations of seven Sensitive species are documented within this management area. Management Area 16-Corral Bottom. The northern portion of the South Fire Complex falls within Management Area 16. No specific or supplemental management direction is provided for species that are currently on the Sensitive Species list, but Howell’s lewisia (Lewisia cotyledon howellii), a species removed from the Sensitive Species list before 1998, is mentioned. While Howell’s lewisia no longer requires additional protection measures to maintain species viability, it remains relatively unimpacted because of its natural habitat on rock outcrops.  Management actions rarely occur on rock outcrops because of the potential for equipment damage. Populations of four Sensitive species are documented here. Management Area 17-Hayfork Creek. No specific management direction is provided for any current Sensitive species, but the presence of Niles’ harmonia (Harmonia doris-nileseae) is noted. Howell’s lewisia (Lewisia cotyledon ssp. howellii) and Pale yellow stonecrop (Sedum laxum ssp. flavidum), are also mentioned, but both were removed from the Regional Forester’s Sensitive Species list before 1998. As in Management Area 16, while both species no longer require additional protection measures to maintain species viability, they remain relatively unimpacted because of its natural habitat on rock outcrops.  Management actions rarely occur on rock outcrops because of the potential for equipment damage. There is supplemental management direction to search suitable habitat for Niles’ harmonia. Populations of three Sensitive species are documented within this management area. Management Area 18-Hayfork. The Forest Plan indicates Tracy’s wooly-stars (Eriastrum tracyi) and Peanut sandwort (Minuartia rosei) as being present here and identifies the presence of habitat for Niles’ harmonia (Harmonia doris-nileseae). No specific management direction is given for Sensitive plants, but there is supplemental management direction to survey for additional Niles’ harmonia populations. Populations of six Sensitive and one Forest Plan Endemic plant species have been documented in this management area. There is supplemental direction to protect rock outcrops from excavation until surveys for pale yellow stonecrop can be completed. Management Area 19-Indian Valley/Rattlesnake. The Forest Plan indicates Peanut sandwort (Minuartia rosei) and Niles’ harmonia are present here and states the entire geographic range of Niles’s harmonia is contained in this management area (additional populations have since been found outside this management area in Management Area 21). This management area lies within the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane, a geologic area rich in serpentine plant species. No specific management direction is given for Sensitive plants, but there is supplemental management direction to survey for additional Niles’ harmonia populations, protect the type localities of Niles’ harmonia and pale yellow stonecrop (no longer a Regional Forester’s sensitive species, but still State-listed as a regional endemic) for their scientific value, and protect rock outcrops from excavation until they have been surveyed for pale yellow stonecrop.  Since publication of the Forest Plan populations of seven Sensitive and two Forest Plan Endemic plant species have been documented. Smoky Creek Research Natural Area is recommended for establishment. Maintain Dubakella Mountain in its present condition pending evaluation as a Special Interest Area. Management Area 20-South Fork Mountain.This management area contains some of the heaviest concentrations of late-successional forest communities on the Forest. Rough Gulch Research Natural Area is within this management area. The Forest Plan states that Umpqua green gentian (Frasera umpquaensis) and pale yellow stonecrop (Sedum laxum ssp. flavidum) have been identified in this management area; pale yellow stonecrop was removed from the Regional Forester’s Sensitive species list before 1998 though it retains California Rare Plant status as a regional endemic. The Forest Plan also notes great botanical diversity on the east side of South Fork Mountain, most notable in a series of springs and fens possibly emerging at South Fork or Bear Wallow fault lines (2010 California Dept. of Conservation Fault Activity Map). No specific management direction is given botanical species, but the presence of unique meadow habitats is acknowledged. There is supplemental management direction to evaluate the meadow areas on the east side to determine if cattle grazing is resulting in decreased biodiversity of plant communities, and implement mitigation efforts if necessary. Though not mentioned in the Forest Plan, an extensive infestation of diffuse knapweed is found in this management area; it is most concentrated on the South Fork Mountain ridgeline and has spread east as far as the South Fork of the Trinity River. Three Sensitive species have been documented here. Management Area 21-Wildwood.This management area lies within the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane and includes the Western Azalea Special Interest Area. The Forest Plan indicates that Management Area 21 includes the center of distribution for Peanut sandwort (Minuartia rosei) and Stebbins’ harmonia (Harmonia stebbinsii) is in this management area. No supplemental direction for botany is given. Populations of seven Sensitive plant species and two Forest Plan Endemic species have been documented in this management area. Sensitive Species This section will review the proposed Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project to determine whether the proposed action would result in a trend toward Federal listing of any Sensitive vascular plant, lichen, bryophyte or fungi species, as designated by the Region 5 Sensitive Species List (USDA, 2013) Forest Service Manual 2672.4 (FSM 2600, 2009) directs that biological evaluations and assessments analyze impacts to Endangered, Threatened, Proposed, or Sensitive species. There are no federally listed threatened or endangered plant species on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest Resource Protection Measures and Project Design Features to Protect Botanical Species of Concern Species Protections After identification of known Sensitive species population and assessment of the most appropriate management measures, all plant populations requiring protection from proposed treatments will be flagged on the ground, and some or all treatments may be excluded within those populations. These sites will be shown on project implementation maps as control areas. If individuals of protected species are discovered after project implementation begins, all off-road ground-disturbing operations will be stopped temporarily in the area of discovery until a Forest Service Botanist or qualified representative recommends appropriate protection measures. This measure will be incorporated into the project design through a contract provision or similar language in any service contracts. Western Waterfan Lichen Stream crossings, rocked or otherwise, will not be constructed on Collins Creek or any of its tributaries known to be occupied by Goward’s waterfan lichen to avoid potential damage to the species. Niles’ and Stebbins’ Harmonia When using heavy equipment with blades, ditches may be cleaned without restriction up to 24 inches in height above the ditch bottom in the area of known Niles’ and Stebbins harmonia populations or their mapped habitat. Above 24 inches, vegetation that obstructs vehicle line of sight will be manually cut and removed without disturbing the roadside. Pacific Fuzzwort Standard provisions for protection of residual trees will be included in all implementation contracts or agreements to avoid accidental scraping of potential Pacific fuzzwort mats at the base of host trees. Operations shall not unnecessarily damage young growth or other trees to be reserved. Umpqua Green Gentian Handline construction will not occur within known populations of Umpqua green gentian. Heavy equipment use will be excluded from grassy or gravelly openings within late-seral conifer forest. Canyon Creek Stonecrop Trees will be directionally felled away from rock outcrops or exposed bedrock greater than 10 feet in diameter. Habitat Protections The following protections are incorporated within the Project’s Resource Protection Measures and the resource prescriptions. Heavy Equipment Use Heavy equipment operations will be excluded from within known Sensitive botanical populations. Locations will be flagged on the ground and marked as control areas on operational maps. Machine piling will be restricted to landings and areas of pre-fire heavy soil disturbance, except where field surveys are conducted and absence of Sensitive botanical species is verified. When using tractors to remove felled trees, material will be skidded with one end suspended wherever possible to minimize soil gouging and potential damage to potential unidentified Sensitive botanical species. Soil Quality Protection Measures for Protection of Botanical Habitat Post-treatment total soil cover should be no less than 50% where it exists prior to treatments, averaged across individual treatment areas. This maintains organic matter on the soil to reduce soil drying and provide nutrients for plant growth. Mechanical skidding equipment is generally restricted to slopes less than 40 percent. On short steep pitches (less than 45% slope, and less than 100 ft in length), mechanical skidding equipment is restricted to slash covered primary skid trails using flexible track skidders with low ground pressure equipment. Wet weather logging is permitted on soils with compaction hazard rating of moderate or less with restrictions (see Field Guide to Soil Moisture Conditions for Operability of Logging Equipment (Rust 2015) and Shasta-Trinity Wet Weather Soil Compaction Hazard Rating (Rust 2008)). Ground-based mechanical equipment will only operate on fine-textured soils (identified as medium and heavy soils in the Field Guide to Soil Moisture Conditions for Operability of Logging Equipment (Rust 2015)) when the top 8 inches of soil are dry (identified as slightly moist soils in the Field Guide), as evaluated by Forest soil scientist or designee. Areas along roads proposed for treatments that have this soil type will be identified on a map for use by the Timber Sale Administrator. Burning Burning prescriptions will be developed to result in no more than 10% mortality of residual live trees 20 inches DBH or greater in late-seral habitats. Serpentine Habitats and Species In general, management and protection measures correspond to three broad serpentine habitat descriptions, Types 1, Type 2, and Type 3. Different types and mixes of serpentine habitats warrant different management requirements based on the quality and/or sensitivity of each site and these are described below. Hazard trees will be felled where found in all serpentine habitats, regardless of the type. Type 1 and Type 2 serpentine sites will be identified on project implementation maps as control areas. See the Botany Biological Evaluation for Type 1, 2, and 3 habitat characteristics. Affected Environment (Sensitive Species) Reference Materials and Methods Resources used to assess habitat for botanical species of concern were corporate GIS database information, documented population records, field surveys, botanical studies, taxonomic keys, and field visits in the project area. Plant community information is derived from CalVeg data109 and informal field visits in the area between 1999 and 2011. Field Surveys Because of the extensive area and urgency of the purpose and need, additional field surveys were not completed for this analysis. Some past field surveys have been completed within the fire areas, but these are not enough to make confident conclusions about presence or absence of Sensitive plant populations. Without complete field survey data, Sensitive botanical species are assumed to be present where suitable habitat is present. Project design features and resource protection measures are incorporated into the design of the action alternatives to reduce potential impacts in suitable habitat and minimize the chance of leading to a trend toward federal listing as a result of implementing the project. Project Area Habitat and Suitability for Sensitive Species Data are unavailable for areas other than National Forest System (NFS) lands therefore this analysis is for NFS lands only. Impact analysis is for the geographic extent of proposed treatments, although consideration is given to surrounding habitats. The six fire areas are spread out over two ecological sections, the Route and Mad River Complexes within the Northern California Coast Ranges Section and the Fork, River, Saddle, and South Complexes within the Klamath Mountains Section (USDA, 1997). Subtle differences in amount of annual precipitation and landslide incidence exist between the two sections, but in general they are very similar in ecological character and both are heavily influenced by a Mediterranean climate of winter precipitation and extended summer drought (Barbour, et al., 2007). Plant communities in the project area are dominated by conifer, hardwood, and mixed conifer/hardwood forest, intermixed with chaparral shrublands. Within conifer forest, all seral stages are represented within areas that burned at less than high fire intensity. The fires changed the distribution and quantity of early, mid, and late seral conifer forest. Where high severity fire occurred, mid and late-seral forest has 109 The CALVEG classification is a provisional system that meets the floristically based level of the National Vegetation Classification Standard hierarchy.

The South, Route, and a small portion of the Fork Complex are all located within the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane, a geologic area rich in serpentine soils. The Rattlesnake Creek Terrane provides habitat to several Sensitive and endemic plant species known only from this area. Wetland mapping on the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest is limited in scope. Wetlands are present in the fire areas, but not within any proposed treatment areas. Hundreds of miles of perennial streams exist within the fire complexes. Combined with shady forest canopy they provide habitat for selected Sensitive botanical species. Large rock outcrops are not usually mapped, but are known to be present and common throughout the Klamath and Northern California Coast Ranges. Special Area Designations Research Natural Areas, Special Interest Areas or Other Specially Designated Botanical Areas There are no established RNAs or botanical SIAs in the any of the fire complexes. Portions of all fires except the River Complex are found within the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane, a unique, 375,000 acre geologic area rich in serpentine soils and endemic plant species. The Rattlesnake Creek Terrane is under consideration for development of a Special Interest Area based on the high number of serpentine endemic species, including five Sensitive and two Forest Plan Endemic plant species. The Dubakella Special Interest Area was established by the Shasta-Trinity Forest Plan, but still requires evaluation for suitability as a Special Interest Area and boundary designation. Habitat Suitability within High and Moderate Severity Fire Areas All fires burned in a mosaic of high, medium, and low severity based on RAVG110 data (Table 3-67). Based on field observations and summarized Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) and RAVG imagery data, sites that burned with the highest severity no longer support suitable habitat for protected botanical species (plants or fungi). On these sites, fire generally and consistently consumed all above ground vegetation and dead woody debris. Fires that burn in late summer (such as seen in the 2015 fires) have much higher potential for killing underground roots and mycelial tissue (fungi) than during fires that start in the spring and early summer because there is less moisture in the soil to buffer fire impacts. As a result, the relationship between high severity fire and loss of suitable habitat for protected botanical species is strong. Areas that burned at moderate severity retained some live trees, but generally have a mix of immediate mortality and live but heavily burned trees and understory that has high likelihood of deforestation or large pockets of mortality due to fire-injury within the next 5-10 years. Because of the loss of suitable habitat in areas that burned with moderate to high severity fire, this analysis will only consider impacts to habitat and species populations within low/very low severity fire and areas not burned in the fires, with the exception of California globemallow that can be found on sites that burned within the past 5 years. 110Rapid Assessment of Vegetation condition after Wildfire (RAVG). RAVG assesses basal area loss after wildfires by comparing pre and post fire satellite imagery. Table 3-67.

All Sensitive species known to be present or thought to be present on the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, based on presence of suitable habitat and other factors, are shown in the Appendix A-2 of the Botany Biological Evaluation. Rationale is provided for species that are thought not to have suitable habitat in the project area. When the geographic area of proposed treatments under all alternatives are combined and overlapping areas removed, 15,990 acres are contained within the proposed treatment area footprint. Each alternative contains a unique combination of treatments; explaining why the footprint total exceeds those under the largest alternative, Alternative 3. Plant communities present within the fires that provide suitable habitat for protected botanical species are shown in Table 3-68, along with the species they support. Conifer Forest Early-Seral Conifer Forest About 55% of the project area, prior to the 2015 fires, was conifer forest (8,398 acres). 30% of that was early-seral (2,459 acres). Early-seral conifer habitat is characterized by tree seedlings or saplings or small trees. There is little or no overstory and shrubs, grasses, and forbs dominate in early-seral habitat. Early and mid-seral forest provides habitat for California globe mallow (Iliamna latibracteata). Mature to Late-Seral Forest, Including Uplands and Riparian Stream Channels 60% of the conifer forest in the project area is late seral (4,631 acres). Late-seral forest is characterized by multi-story stands with large-diameter trees, high species diversity above and below ground, presence of partially decomposed coarse woody debris, and occasional canopy gaps occupied by early seral species. It provides habitat for mountain and Brownie lady’s-slippers (Cypripedium montanum, C. fasciculatum), Umpqua green gentian (Frasera umpquaensis), Pacific fuzzwort (Ptilidium californicum), red-pored bolete (Boletus pulcherrimus), branched collybia (Dendrocollybia racemosa), olive phaeocollybia (Phaeocollybia olivacea), orange-peel fungus (Sowerbyella rhenana), bug-on-a-stick (Buxbaumia viridis), and western waterfan lichen (Peltigera gowardii) (last two in perennial streams). Closed Cone Pine Forest; Gravelly Flats and Benches in Chaparral Communities Knobcone pine forest is an acceptable representative of closed cone pine forest and chaparral communities on the Forest. 73 acres is present within proposed treatment units. The amount that would be present under each alternative varies from 43 to 73 acres. Knobcone pine forest is naturally sparse with few trees and somewhat low hazardous fuel levels. It provides quality suitable habitat for Tracy’s woolystars (Eriastrum tracyi). Riparian Habitats Perennial, shaded streams are habitat for bug-on-a-stick, western waterfan lichen, mountain lady’s-slipper, and Brownie lady’s-slipper. Bug-on-a-stick grows on moist, partially decomposed large-diameter logs in constant contact with a perennial water source. Brownie and mountain lady’s-slipper orchids can be found outside of riparian areas if there is a good shade layer and adequate surface litter and duff, but prefer to be near perennial streams where cooler, moister air is provided. Perennial stream length within proposed treatment areas varies from 8.9 miles (32 ac) under the Proposed Action and Alternatives 4 and 5, to 18.1 miles (66 ac) under Alternative 3. Riparian streams in late-seral forest provide habitat for bug-on-a-stick, mountain and Brownie lady’s-slipper, and western waterfan lichen. Serpentine Soils 39 acres of serpentine soils are present within the proposed treatment areas. Serpentine soils appear naturally lacking in vegetation but some have widely-spaced Jeffrey pine and incense cedar trees. The extent of serpentine soils within proposed treatment areas ranges from 27 acres under the Proposed Action and Alternatives 4 and 5 to 39 acres under Alternative 3. Serpentine soils provide habitat for Niles’ and Stebbins' harmonia (Harmonia doris-nilesiae, H. stebbinsii) and Peanut sandwort (Minuartia rosei). Roadcuts-Serpentine and Partial-Serpentine Roadcuts contain bare mineral soil needed to support Shasta chaenactis (Chaenactis suffrutescens). There are 233 miles of roadcuts in the project area, providing 452 acres of suitable habitat for that species. Within those miles, 9 miles bisect serpentine soils that provide habitat for Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia as well as Shasta chaenactis. Table 3-68.

It grows within crevices and on ledges in outcrops. Rock outcrops that support this species are typically greater than 10 feet in diameter and can be set horizontally on the ground or follow vertical slopes. Rock outcrops are represented by “barrens” in the CalVeg vegetation classification. 90 acres of barrens are found in treatment areas under Alternative 3; 83 acres are found in all other alternatives. Species Accounts Species accounts were compiled from a number of sources, including the California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB, 2016), UC Berkeley CalFlora Database (2016), NatureServe Explorer Database (NatureServe, 2015), California Native Plant Society Inventory of Rare and Endangered Plants (CNPS, 2016), the Jepson Manual (Baldwin et al, 2012), Forest Service Natural Resource Information System database (NRIS) and Shasta-Trinity National Forest species records and reference materials. Early-Seral Conifer Habitat California globemallow is a perennial herb found only in northern California and southern Oregon. No populations are known from any proposed treatment areas. Late-Seral Conifer Habitat (including riparian stream channel) Uplands Mountain lady’s-slipper is wide ranging but rare western North American orchid. It is found in 6 western states. Three populations are near or within proposed treatment areas. Brownie lady’s-slipper is another wide ranging but rare western North American orchid. It is found in 8 western states. Three populations are found within proposed treatment areas. Umpqua green gentian is a tall, long-lived perennial forb that is entirely restricted (endemic) to a localized geographic area south of Highway 36 on South Fork Mountain. All populations are within the Mad River Fire Complex near Pickett Peak; three populations (11 subpopulations) are within proposed treatment areas. Pacific fuzzwort has a North Pacific Rim distribution extending from Japan and the Russian Far East into southeastern Alaska, western British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. Pacific fuzzwort requires a live tree as a substrate and doesn’t persist long once a tree has died. No known populations are within or near any proposed treatment areas, but suitable habitat is present. Red-pored bolete is a solitary fungus that grows in association with roots of mixed conifers and tanoak in coastal forests in Washington, Oregon, and northern California. No known populations within any proposed treatment areas, but suitable habitat is present . Branched collybia is a fungi species that is widespread in the northern hemisphere but locally rare. No populations are in proposed treatment areas, but suitable habitat is present. Branched collybia is found in clumps on rotting or mummified remnants of gilled mushrooms or seldom in nutrient-rich leaf mulch in forests. Olive phaeocollybia is a gilled mushroom that grows in scatters or arcs in mixed forests containing oak or pine trees. It requires mature oak or pine species as host trees. The Forest Glen populations are very close to the edge of the Mad River Fire Complex, but not within it or any proposed treatment area. Suitable habitat is present. Riparian Stream Channels Bug-on-a-stick is a bryophyte that occurs throughout the world, and in 6 northern and western states. None are near any of the fire complexes or proposed treatment areas, although suitable habitat is present. Western waterfan lichen is an underwater lichen that anchors itself to rocks in cool mountain streams. There are 43 populations currently known from California with a cluster of sites on Collins Creek near Forest Glen. The species is considered to be an indicator of water quality. Suitable habitat is present in perennial streams other than the Collins Creek system. Closed Cone Forest, Gravelly Flats and Benches in Chaparral Tracy’s wooly-stars occurs on dry, gravelly soils on flats and benches in closed-cone pine forests or chaparral below 4400 feet. It is known only from California. No known populations are found in any proposed treatment areas, but suitable habitat is present. Serpentine Soils Outside of Roadcuts The Rattlesnake Creek Terrane is a unique geologic area rich in serpentine soils that support a suite of plant species specially adapted to tolerate harsh serpentine soils. It spans 375,000 acres mostly in Trinity County, and follows a northwest to southeast band roughly between the east slope of South Fork Mountain and the towns of Hayfork and Burnt Ranch. A number of species on the Sensitive Species List are found within the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane. The Shasta-Trinity National Forest is in the process of developing a conservation strategy for management of rare and endemic species found on the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane and the habitats they occupy. Serpentine soils outside of roadcuts are generally gently-sloped and vary in their mineral composition. These soils have high quantities of heavy metals (nickel, chromium, others) and very low amounts of calcium, making them inhospitable for most native, non-serpentine plants. As a result, serpentine soils on the Forest support only three tree species (Jeffrey pine, incense cedar, gray pine) and a limited number of forbs and shrubs adapted to serpentine minerology. They are also fairly easy to visually distinguish from non-serpentine soils and the plant communities they support. Niles’s harmonia, Stebbins’ harmonia and Peanut sandwort grow only on high quality serpentine soils containing only serpentinite and peridotite, and are restricted to the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane. Peanut sandwort is a low-growing perennial herb that occupies openings in serpentine soil with a high content of peridotite minerology. It is entirely restricted to the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane. One population is within a proposed treatment area in the Fork Fire Complex. Niles’ harmonia is an early season annual restricted to the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane that occupies openings in serpentine soil with a high serpentinite or peridotite mineral content. There is a single population within a proposed treatment area in the Fork Fire Complex. Stebbins’ harmonia is similar to Niles’ harmonia and occurs in similar habitats. It is an early season annual that occupies openings in serpentine soil with a high content of serpentinite or peridotite minerology. No known populations are within proposed treatment areas, but suitable habitat is present for both species. Serpentine Roadcuts Shasta chaenactis is endemic to the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. It is a low-growing perennial that occupies two seemingly different habitats, gravelly, stabilized streambeds of high order rivers/streams and rocky roadcuts that are primarily on serpentine soils or with serpentine inclusions. 38 populations are documented in Trinity and Siskiyou Counties, with 24 known from the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, but nearly half are historical sightings that haven’t been revisited in the last 30 years to determine if they still exist. Roadcuts on serpentine soils are present in the proposed treatment areas. Niles’ harmonia-see Serpentine Soils above. Stebbins’ harmonia-see Serpentine Soils above. Rock Outcrops and Barrens Canyon Creek stonecrop is geographically restricted to the southern Klamath Ranges from western Shasta to eastern Humboldt Counties. It is known only from California. There are no known populations in proposed treatment areas, but suitable habitat is present. Refer to the Botany Evaluation for conservation rankings and known threats for each species listed above. Environmental Consequences (Sensitive Species)For each of the six alternatives considered in detail, environmental impacts were analyzed and documented in detail, including identification of the resource protection measures incorporated into the project design, and the effectiveness of those measures to mitigate adverse impacts. Overall Impacts of Different Treatment Types (Direct and Indirect Impacts) Sixteen populations of eight Sensitive botanical species are known from the project area, but there is habitat for sixteen total species. Because comprehensive field surveys were not completed, it is assumed individuals of the 16 species could be present and potential impacts will be analyzed. These 16 species are: California globe mallow Mountain lady’s-slipper Brownie lady’s-slipper Umpqua green gentian Bug-on-a-stick Pacific fuzzwort Red-pored bolete Branched collybia Olive phaeocollybia Western waterfan lichen Tracy’s wooly-stars Shasta chaenactis Niles’ harmonia Stebbins harmonia Peanut sandwort Canyon Creek stonecrop The proposed treatments generally result in the same physical impacts to all species. Differences would be in the resilience to impacts based on individual plant size, sensitivity to disturbance, reproductive process, or placement above or belowground. Specific activities associated with treatments that were described above, are classified below in Table 3-69 by the severity of the disturbance on Sensitive plants and fungi; low, moderate, or heavy impacts. Table 3-69. Disturbance Classes of Proposed Treatments. Treatment Category  Low Impact Treatments  Moderate Impact Treatments  Heavy Impact Treatments  Road Buffer Treatments  Fall hazard trees  Remove hazard trees-cable  Remove hazard trees-tractor  Lopping  Mastication  Pile burning  Pruning  Jackpot burn  Machine piling  Hand piling  Broadcast burn  Chipping  Construct handlines around Treatment units  Road brushing/ditch cleaning  Rocking stream crossings  Salvage – Commercial Tree Removal  Fall trees outside treatment units for operational safety  Remove hazard trees-cable  Remove hazard trees-tractor  Tree planting  Re-use old landings  New landing construction  Borate application on cut stumps  Construct ramps up to 100 feet to access landings  Additional Fuelbreak Construction  Thin live and dead trees up to 10” DBH to 40% canopy up to 200ft from road  Construct up to 1 mile of new temporary road. Decommission after use  Thin live and dead trees up to 10” DBH to 60% canopy 200-400 feet from road  Decommission unauthorized roads after use  Thin live and dead trees up to 10” DBH to 80% canopy 400-600 feet from road  Use unauthorized roads as temporary access roads  Follow up Maintenance – 5-10 years into the future (Alt 2 only)  Fall new hazard trees  Prescribed burning  Handpile excess fuels  Hand fall small trees and brush  Road Maintenance, Reconstruction, Restoration, and Decommissioning (Connected Action)  Maintenance Actions: Grading, ditch cleaning, rolling dips, removing structures, rocking existing roads, install native material barriers  Applying riprap, pulling culverts, outsloping/returning roads to the natural slope within the existing road prism  Outsloping/returning roads to natural slope within terrain >25% slope, replacing/upsizing culverts in perennial streams where disturbance exceeds the existing footprint  Refer to the Botany Evaluation for a complete description of how botanical species are affected by the listed activity type within each impact category. As with salvage treatments, Table 3-70 shows the maximum extent of potential disturbance that could occur to late-seral habitat with temporary road construction, if all roads were placed only in that habitat. Final placement of temporary roads would occur after operations start and there is no way to know where that will be at this time. Temporary roads would be located throughout treatment areas and would be unlikely to be placed exclusively in late-seral habitat; the amount of potential disturbance is shown for disclosure purposes. Table 3-70. Tractor-Generated Disturbance in Late-Seral Habitat under each Action Alternative. Alternative  Salvage Treatments with Tractors  New Temporary Road Construction & Decommissioning, Unauthorized Route Decommissioning  Entire Treatment Area  Within Late-Seral Habitat  Entire Treatment Area  Within Late-Seral Habitat  Proposed Action  8000  193  0  0  2  9600  728  0  0  3  15200  326  3 miles/5 acres Up to 10-½ acre landings  3 miles/5 acres Up to 10-½ acre landings  4  8000  25  0  0  5  0  0  0  0  Connected Actions: Road Maintenance, Reconstruction, Restoration, and Decommissioning Road maintenance, reconstruction, restoration, and decommissioning treatments may occur on any NFS roads that are connected with implementation of the project to protect resources, safely and efficiently accommodate machine and worker access, and provide for removal of forest products; NFS roads within the fire footprint as well as those planned for utilization as haul routes for log removal outside the fire footprint, or approximately 247 miles of road. These types of treatments are generally intensive by nature because they require heavy soil disturbance to accomplish the objectives. But because they always occur within a road prism suitable habitat is no longer available except where selected roads have been untouched for decades or more and stabilization has begun. Treatments that extend beyond the road bed into cut/fill slopes or beyond the full road prism, such as outsloping and recontouring have potential to result in moderate or heavy ground disturbance up to about 20 feet from the edge of the road prism. Sensitive or other protected botanical species present within disturbed areas could be impacted. Spatial Boundary Spatial bounding for Niles’ harmonia, Stebbins’ harmonia, and Peanut sandwort would be the boundary of the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane, the 375,000 acre geologic area that bisects the project area and contains large areas of serpentine soils and endemic plant species. Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia and Peanut sandwort grow only within the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane and this is the only meaningful spatial area boundary for cumulative impacts. The spatial area for Umpqua green gentian is South Fork Mountain from Bennett Peak south to the Yolla Bolly Wilderness and from the ridgeline to approximately 1 mile east. This is approximately the extent of the soil types the species grows on (entisols, inceptisols). The spatial area for the other twelve species would be the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Wherever possible the spatial area is reduced to just the west side of the Forest, the Trinity River and South Fork Management Units. The entire range of these species extends beyond the Forest, but is capped at the west side to be a meaningful area of cumulative impacts analysis. Temporal Boundary Cumulative effects are bounded in time by the extent of documented ground-disturbing actions we are aware of in the past, 1900 and later, and planned actions that have been formally published into the future, 20 years or less. Actions considered are those that are thought to have an adverse impact on the Sensitive plant species in this analysis or habitat for those species. Those actions can occur on Shasta-Trinity National Forest lands and on adjacent lands under other ownership or management. Consideration of present and future actions is limited to those being implemented currently and those in planning stages that have been publicly scoped at the time of writing the Botany Evaluation. Threshold of Cumulative Impacts There are no specific thresholds required under law or by Forest Service regulations or policy for cumulative impacts to Sensitive botanical species, with the exception of Shasta-Trinity Land and Resource Management Plan direction to manage Sensitive species in a way that management actions will not lead to a trend toward federal listing. Sensitive species are rare by nature and generally have little or no scientific data on thresholds. Thresholds of species degradation will not be identified for this project, but the potential for cumulative impacts to occur as a result of implementing the proposed project will be addressed. Table 3-71.

Those individual plants could be lost if outsloping or recontouring treatments are applied where the individuals lie, but hundreds more individuals upslope of those would be unaffected. Bare mineral soil created through outsloping or recontouring would provide ideal habitat for recruitment and growth of the adjacent California globemallow population. The 2015 wildfires greatly expanded the amount of suitable habitat available for California globemallow by moving mid and late-seral conifer forest to early-seral forest. 227 acres of high and 4,604 acres of moderate intensity fire burned hot enough to currently provide 4,831 acres of early-seral plant communities. Some portion of these acres may not be conifer forest. Resource protection measures and Best Management Practices incorporated into the project design will reduce potential impact to California globe mallow. Known populations will be flagged and heavy equipment use and new temporary road and landing construction will be prohibited within known population boundaries. Table 3-72. Summary of Populations and Habitat of California Globemallow Early-seral conifer forest California globe mallow  Proposed Action  Alt 2  Alt 3  Alt 4  Alt 5  Treatment Acres  8000  9600  15,200  8000  8000  Number of Populations Present  0  0  0  0  0  Suitable Habitat Acres Present  1527  1945  2864  1527  1537  Direct and Indirect Impacts Proposed Action (Alternative 1) 1,527 acres of early-conifer forest was present within proposed treatments just prior to the 2015 fires under the Proposed Action. Additional suitable habitat is present now in areas of moderate and high intensity fire, but some of that occurred where early-seral conifer forest was already present. Previous early-seral habitat would not have trees large enough to be considered hazard trees after the 2015 fires, therefore wouldn’t require either hazard tree felling or commercial salvage treatments. Tree planting and fuels reduction treatments (hand or mastication treatments) of small trees and shrubs could be expected to occur in California globemallow habitat, but any adverse impacts from these treatments would be negligible if at all. Prescribed burning treatments would stimulate germination of seed in the soil, resulting in a beneficial impact of increased seedling recruitment. Other low impact treatments would be expected to have little or no impact on California globe mallow. Heavy equipment use associated with removing hazard trees, fuelbreak treatments, and temporary road construction and decommissioning could cause damage to currently unidentified California globemallow populations. Although large plants, they don’t contain woody tissue and would easily crush if driven over. Resprouting would likely occur if the woody caudex at the base is not highly disturbed; younger plants with smaller caudices could possibly die, but older plants have larger caudices and more tissue from which to regenerate. The degree of impacts to the species will also depend on how deep heavy equipment goes into the soil in the area of populations. Alternative 2 1,945 acres of suitable habitat are present within proposed treatments under Alternative 2. Potential treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-72, are the same as described for the Proposed Action. Alternative 3 2,864 acres of suitable habitat are present within proposed treatments under Alternative 3. Alternative 3 also includes development/decommissioning of up to 3 miles of existing unauthorized routes for temporary road use. Potential treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-72, are the same as described for the Proposed Action. Alternative 4 1,527 acres of suitable habitat are present within proposed treatments under Alternative 4. Potential treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-72, are the same as described for the Proposed Action. Alternative 5 1,537 acres of suitable habitat are present within proposed treatments under Alternative 5. Potential treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-72, are the same as described for the Proposed Action. Alternative 6-No Action No impacts would occur if the proposed action or any alternatives are not implemented. Assuming any new wildfires occur far enough into the future for existing populations to replenish the seedbank, they would perpetuate early-seral habitat needed to maintain California globemallow populations. Cumulative Impacts Six populations of California globe mallow are known from the Forest, none within or near any proposed treatment areas. The proposed treatments would result in increased habitat for California globe mallow. In combination with past, present, and foreseeable future actions, there are expected to be no cumulative impacts from the proposed project under any alternative. Determination There is no significant difference between the five action alternatives. There is no difference in number of known population between alternatives. Less than 20% of the treatment acres in each alternative contain suitable habitat for California globemallow. The Trinity Post-Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project may affect individuals, but is not likely to result in a trend toward Federal listing or loss of viability for California globemallow. Late-Seral Conifer Forest -Upland Associated Species: Brownie Lady’s-slipper, Mountain Lady’s-slipper, Red-Pored Bolete, Branched Collybia, Olive Phaeocollybia, Pacific fuzzwort, and Umpqua Green Gentian The amount of suitable habitat (mature to late-seral conifer forest) for Brownie and mountain lady’sslipper orchids, red-pored bolete, branched collybia, olive phaeocollybia, Pacific fuzzwort, and Umpqua green gentian ranges from 2,380 acres under the Proposed Action and Alternative 4 and 5, to 4,631 acres under Alternative 3. Three populations of Brownie lady’s-slipper are known to occur within proposed treatment areas: two in the South Fire within the Alternative 3 road buffer treatments on FS 4N30 (Pattison Peak area); and one in the Fork Fire within proposed treatment areas under all alternatives on FS 30N31 (Natural Bridge area). Three populations of mountain lady’s-slipper are known to occur within proposed treatment areas: one in the River Fire within proposed treatment areas under all alternatives on FS5N13 (Salt Log Spring); one within the riparian zone next to FS31N20 within proposed treatment areas in all alternatives (Natural Bridge); and a third within proposed treatments under all alternatives (Philpot Campground). There is an additional population of mountain lady’-slipper outside of but directly adjacent to an Alternative 3 road buffer treatment; the population will be flagged to avoid any potential impacts from treatments within the proposed road buffer. Table 3-73.

There is a cluster of five populations of olive phaeocollybia near Collins Creek just outside proposed treatment areas in the Mad River Fire, but there would be no impacts to these populations. Chapter 3 Eleven documented populations of Umpqua green gentian within proposed treatment areas are clustered within 1.25 miles of Pickett Peak in the Mad River Fire Complex. No populations of Pacific fuzzwort have been documented within proposed treatment areas under any alternative. Direct and Indirect Impacts Proposed Action – Alternative 1 There are 2,380 acres of suitable late-seral conifer uplalnd habitat in treatment areas under the Proposed Action. Impacts to above ground stems of mountain and Brownie lady’s-slipper orchids, Umpqua green gentian, and Pacific fuzzwort from tree falling, mastication, and hauling felled trees include stem breakage and crushing. Physical impacts from falling hazard trees for safety or for commercial salvage and yarding trees with cables could cause stem breakage, but plants would be expected to recover by the next growing season from rootstock. No impacts are expected for Pacific fuzzwort because the species grows on the boles of live trees only. Trees falling on individual lady’s-slipper plants could encourage plants to go dormant for a prolonged length of time. If few hazard trees are dispersed over a large area, falling impacts would be mild. Concentrations of hazard trees in a smaller area could lead to greater impacts, but concentrations are an indicator of more severe wildfire and resulting degradation of habitat. Lopping, pruning, hand piling, tree planting, hand falling small trees and brush would have little short term and no long-term impacts. Accumulations of biomass from mastication and chipping could cause temporary smothering of lady’s-slipper orchids and Umpqua green gentian plants, but accumulations should decrease to a fraction of their original depth by the following growing season. Impacts are not expected to result in death of any individuals. Heavy equipment travel through treatment areas has potential to penetrate further into the soil and cause damage to underground roots, corms, and mycelium of all seven species. Tractors have the potential to come in contact with Pacific fuzzwort mats on tree boles, although this would be a rare event. Pieces of mats left near tree boles could potentially expand from the ground to the adjacent live tree (possible but not likely), but most broken pieces wouldn’t survive. A provision will be placed in all implementation contracts or agreements that will protect residual trees from unnecessary damage trees from operations. Hazard tree falling would be restricted to dead trees. No live or healthy trees will be cut with the exception of a very small number of live trees that pose a risk to operational safety. Handline construction around treatment areas could excavate isolated individual plants that fall in the path of a handline. All of the populations intersect with handlines could intersect individual plants if not restricted. Prescribed burning could consume aboveground rosettes of Umpqua green gentian, but would be unlikely to kill rootstock or entire plants. Pile burning could generate heat impacts deeper into the soil if soil is dry at the time of ignition. Burning when soil is moist buffers most heat impacts, restricting them to no more than the top inch and reducing or eliminating potential for mortality. Short stretches of temporary road construction (access ramps) and subsequent decommissioning has potential to greatly impact one or more populations (or subpopulations) of all seven species because these roads are intentionally highly compacted and vegetation is scraped off at the surface with roots excavated where necessary. All populations will be flagged and mapped as control areas that exclude temporary road construction, eliminating impacts from that activity. Tractors used to yard trees for salvage utilization (salvage/fuelwood/biomass) have the potential to cause damage to underground orchid corms and mycelial networks when multiple passes are made or if tires excavate deeper into the soil such as can be seen at turning points. Best Management Practices require trees to be endlined wherever possible and tractors to travel over forest debris to reduce soil disturbance from tires. Tree trunks will be limbed prior to yarding to the landing, reducing yarding impacts, but there is still potential for endlined trunks to gouge the soil and break up the mycelial network with yarding. Resource protection measures for soil call for retaining at least 50-70% soil cover across treatment units with at least 50% of that in fine organic materials, helping to reduce contact between heavy equipment and loose soil. Spreading lopped branches over tractor paths will reduce soil compaction and vegetation crushing and increase the potential for individual plant recovery after operations are completed. Without protection measures, tractor blades or forks that are invasive into the soil could easily unearth corms and break the mycelial network; species would recover well from excavation. Most populations are very restricted in size, increasing the probability of death of an entire population. Machine piling will be restricted to previously heavily disturbed areas, where these species are not likely to occur. Known populations would be flagged and avoided and impacts from machine piling are unlikely to occur. Mastication will not adversely impact any of the seven species because blades are kept at least 6 inches above the ground. Northern spotted owl limited operating periods will prohibit mechanical operations until at least July, restricting operation until most lady’s-slipper orchid populations have gone into dormancy for the season. Biomass produced from mastication and chipping treatments will benefit all five species by speeding up the process of decomposition and organic matter production, a key component of quality habitat. Jackpot and broadcast burning would have little adverse impact on the species, despite underground corms and fungal mycelium being shallowly buried. Both types of burning are designed to burn lightly with only minor heat penetration into the soil, with the goal of less than 50% consumption of surface organic matter. Low intensity fire has been shown to benefit lady’s-slipper orchids. Hand pile burning has greater potential for adverse heat penetration into the soil with some potential for death of roots and soil organisms. Other proposed treatments (tree planting and borate application) will have no impact on lady’s-slipper orchid or fungi populations. Tree planting would only occur where stands are understocked, in stands that lack enough canopy cover to expect any of the species to be present. Alternative 2 2,898 acres of suitable habitat are present within proposed treatments under Alternative 2. Potential treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-73, are the same as described for the Proposed Action. Under Alternative 2, reduction of canopy to as low as 40% in the first 200 feet from the road in graduated shaded fuelbreak construction treatment could reduce canopy cover in late-seral habitats enough to degrade habitat for the species. Approximately 730 acres of the fuelbreak are in late-seral habitat. Approximately 96 acres of this late seral habitat were burned during the 2015 fires at moderate or high severity and may no longer provide suitable habitat for these species. A minimum of 50% canopy cover is recommended for management of Sensitive fungi and lady’s-slipper orchid habitat, which will be met in the 200’-400’ and 400’-600’ bands of the graduated fuelbreak. Increased sunlight speeds up soil moisture loss in the summer, which leads to slower organic matter decomposition that is necessary for lady’sslipper orchid and fungi species to thrive. Umpqua green gentian occupies open to partially open sites in conifer forest. Increased sunlight from graduated shaded fuelbreak construction will not negatively impact the species. Hand falling dead trees/vegetation and live trees under 10 inches DBH under Alternative 2 could result in some physical damage to Umpqua green gentian plants that could be present in the area. Alternative 3 4,631 acres of suitable habitat are present within proposed treatments under Alternative 3. Potential treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-73, are the same as described for the Alternative 2. Alternative 4 2,380 acres of suitable habitat are present within proposed treatments under Alternative 4. Potential treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-73, are the same as described for the Proposed Action. Alternative 5 2,380 acres of suitable habitat are present within proposed treatments under Alternative 5. Potential treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-73, are the same as described for the Proposed Action. Alternative 6-No Action No impacts would occur if the proposed action or any alternatives are not implemented. Any unidentified populations of the seven species would continue to persist until habitat or environmental conditions change and suitable habitat is no longer available. Canopy shade could take slightly longer to develop without tree planting, extending the time required for recovery of late-seral habitat characteristics. Lady’s-slipper orchids are thought to require periodic light burning. The absence of burning treatments would be somewhat less beneficial for the species, but would allow for greater litter, duff, and organic matter accumulation that benefits orchids and fungi species. Exclusion of tree falling and removal treatments, as well as new temporary road and landing construction and decommissioning would eliminate physical impacts to the species. Not implementing the action alternatives would avoid the small potential for Pacific fuzzwort to be damaged or killed by scraping caused by tractor movement through a treatment area. It would also eliminate any potential injury or mortality from prescribed burning treatments. There would be little effective difference between the action and no action alternatives for the above treatments as well as hazard tree falling treatments because the species doesn’t grow on dead trees. Trees with less than 25% live canopy or enough damage/disease to warrant hazard status are expected to die within a few years. There is no effective difference between the action and no action alternatives for low impact treatments (tree planting, hand piling, lopping, pruning, and borate stump application) because these activities would have no impact on Pacific fuzzwort even when implemented. Resource Protections Resource protection measures and Best Management Practices incorporated into the project design will reduce potential impact to Brownie and Mountain Lady’s-Slipper Orchids, Red-Pored Bolete, Branched Collybia, Olive Phaeocollybia, Pacific fuzzwort, and Umpqua green gentian. Known populations of all species will be flagged and all proposed treatments that cause adverse impacts excluded. Treatments that provide beneficial impacts or no impact at all would be permitted within populations. Cumulative Impacts Table70 lists the past, present, and future actions that have happened within the cumulative impacts analysis area. Actions that could create cumulative impacts to Brownie and Mountain Lady’s-Slipper Orchids, Red-Pored Bolete, Branched Collybia, Olive Phaeocollybia, Pacific fuzzwort, and Umpqua green gentian are those that would take place in late-seral conifer forest habitat. 38,481 acres of timber harvest on Federal lands have been implemented on the west side of the Forest since 1950. 4,931 acres of harvest has occurred on neighboring private timberlands. Projects currently being planned and including a component of late-seral forest include a Most of the timber harvest projects were clearcuts and over 50% of the fuel reduction treatments were implemented using heavy equipment. Timber harvest within late-seral forest habitat on neighboring private timberlands has likely degraded some habitat since the 1950’s or earlier as well. There is a high likelihood that most or all of that harvest activity used overstory removal systems. Response to timber harvest actions, including associated heavy equipment use to yard logs, temporary road, skid trail, and landing construction would vary from temporary damage to habitat and populations to permanent loss of any of the seven species. About 23,000 miles of roads were built on the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest since the 1950’s. New road construction was at its peak in the 1970’s and 1980’s to access mining operations and facilitate timber harvest. It has dropped off significantly since the mid-1990’s and no new roads have been built on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest since 2003. Some or all roads built for timber harvest would have been built through late-seral conifer forest. Lady’s-slipper orchids and their habitat can’t recover from this type of action. Over 100,000 acres of fuel reduction treatments have also been implemented since about the mid-1950’s, either for the primary purpose of reducing flammable vegetation and wood or to reduce post-harvest fuels. Post-harvest fuel reduction treatments may have taken place in late-seral forest habitats, but the majority of work focusses on vegetative ingrowth over the last 70 years due to fire exclusion. In these cases, adequate canopy closure is often left, but associated disturbances to soil and surface organic matter from heavy equipment operations may have degraded habitat. 4,831 acres within the footprint of the proposed treatments burned at moderate or high severity in 2015. Of these, 1096 acres burned within that were late-seral forest communities before the fires of 2015, where suitable habitat for the seven species was present. 984,523 acres have burned at various fire severities within the cumulative impacts analysis area. High and sometimes moderate severity fires that sterilize the upper surface of the soil resulted in death of populations and/or long-term habitat degradation of the seven species, but this is not always the case. Low and moderate severity fires would have had little adverse impact or may have benefited habitat and populations. Mountain and Brownie Lady’s-slippers, Pacific Fuzzwort, and Umpqua Green Gentian An overwhelming majority of the known populations of both these orchids have been discovered by predisturbance botanical surveys where timber harvest units or roads are being planned in the immediate vicinity; on both public and private lands. Botanical surveys and mitigation for these species have been implemented on the Shasta-Trinity and other California national forests since the mid-1980’s; since then timber harvest projects have mitigated effects to this species through ‘flag and avoid’ protection. With implementation of the Northwest Forest Plan, both of these orchids were afforded extra surveys and protections through the Survey and Manage standard. No specific information is available on population effects before 1985; it is likely that during the several decades of intensive harvest of old-growth timber on public and private forest lands following World War II, lady’s slipper populations were destroyed or fragmented. Several small lady’s slipper populations have been found on the Shasta-Trinity at culvert outlets, on ground that was certainly heavily disturbed during road construction. This indicates that the orchids are capable of colonizing previously disturbed ground after the disturbance is stabilized, and if other habitat requirements for shade, water, and mycorrhizal partners are met. One small population of mountain lady’s slipper, previously known from Philpot Campground, was apparently killed by hot wildfire in 1987. Many new lady’s slipper populations of both species have been discovered after the year 2000, in the area between Weaverville and Trinity Lake. Two populations of Pacific fuzzwort are within proposed treatment units. It isn’t known if the host trees supporting individuals in these populations are still alive, but RAVG mapping of fire severity indicates one population was within moderate and high severity fire and the other was within an area that didn’t burn in 2015. In all likelihood, only one population is still alive. Past actions that would have had the greatest impact on Pacific fuzzwort populations and habitat are timber harvest and past wildfire that killed host trees. Red-Pored Bolete, Branched Collybia, and Olive Phaeocollybia Currently there are 2 known populations of red-pored bolete, 3 populations of branched collybia, and 21 populations of olive phaeocollybia on the Forest, but not within the planned treatment areas. Planned treatments combined with resource protection measures will maintain necessary habitat components for red-pored bolete, branched collybia, and olive phaeocollybia. The new treatments will result in no more than minor impacts to red-pored bolete, branched collybia, and olive phaeocollybia, and in combination with past, present, and future actions will result in no cumulative impacts to the three species. Determination Suitable habitat is present and field surveys have not been completed in all areas and undiscovered populations of the seven species may be present. Past timber harvest and fuel reduction actions affected over a million acres of heavy impacts to the seven species. Suitable habitat and populations have probably been lost because of those actions. Resource protection measures will be incorporated into the proposed treatments to minimize impacts of treatments and in some cases eliminate potential impacts. The proposed project may affect individuals but will not result in a trend toward federal listing for mountain lady’s-slipper, Brownie lady’s-slipper, Umpqua green gentian, Pacific fuzzwort, red-pored bolete, branched collybia, or olive phaeocollybia. Comparison of Alternatives As shown in Table 3-73, Alternatives 2, 4, 5, and the Proposed Action may affect equal numbers of populations of each of the seven Sensitive species, but Alternative 2 treats about 500 acres more and Alternative 3 treats almost twice as many acres in late-seral forest. Regardless, with incorporation of resource protection measures to eliminate the most impactful treatments, no alternative will result in more impacts to any species than any other. In the end, with resource protection measures there is no effective difference between alternatives. Late-Seral Conifer Forest -Riparian Stream Channel Associated Species: Bug-on-astick and western waterfan lichen Bug-on-a-stick and western waterfan lichen are only found directly in perennial stream channels in lateseral conifer forest. Bug-on-a-stick grows on decayed logs in flowing streams. No populations of western bug-on-a-stick are within any proposed treatment areas. Table 3-74. Summary of Populations and Habitat of Bug-on-a-stick and Western Waterfan Lichen. Late-seral conifer habitat-Riparian Bug-on-a-stick Western waterfan lichen  Proposed Action  Alt 2  Alt 3  Alt 4  Alt 5  Treatment Acres  8000  9600  15,200  8000  8000  Suitable Habitat Acres Present  8.9 mi 32.4 ac  9.7 m 35.3 ac  18.1 mi 65.8 ac  8.9 mi 32.4 ac  8.9 m 32.4 ac  Number of Known Populations Present  Bug-on-a-stick  0  0  0  0  0  Western waterfan lichen  0  0  0  0  0  No populations of western waterfan lichen are within any proposed treatment areas, but there is a cluster of subpopulations in the Collins Creek drainage, a perennial riparian area at the south end of the Mad River Fire. These are found along Collins Creek between FS1S04 and FS1S26. Surveys haven’t been completed, but additional plants are expected upstream of this site within a proposed treatment area surrounding FS1S04. Direct and Indirect Impacts Proposed Action – Alternative 1 There are 8.9 miles (32.4 acres) of perennial stream habitat for bug-on-a-stick and western waterfan lichen in treatments under the Proposed Action. Protection measures for Riparian Reserves and perennial stream channels eliminate most impacts to either species from most proposed treatments. Because bug-on-a-stick is found only on large wood in perennial streams and western waterfan lichen is found only under water in perennial streams, no impacts would be expected to occur to either species as a result of implementing treatments. Spot rocking for stream crossings has the potential to disturb western waterfan lichen thalli as rocks are placed in streams. Rock for this purpose is usually at least 1 inch or larger, which could tear lichen thalli or remove them from the rocks they grown on. To prevent loss of any unidentified populations, spot rocking and stream crossings will be prohibited on Collins Creek and its tributaries. Alternative 2 There are 9.7 miles (35.3 acres) of suitable habitat in treatment areas under Alternative 2. As with the Proposed Action, no impacts would occur because of Riparian Reserve protection measures. Alternative 3 There are 18.1 miles (65.8 acres) of suitable stream habitat present within proposed treatment areas under Alternative 3. As with the Proposed Action, no impacts would occur because of Riparian Reserve protection measures. Alternative 4 There are 8.9 miles (32.4 acres) of suitable stream habitat in treatment areas under Alternative 4. As with the Proposed Action, no impacts would occur because of Riparian Reserve protection measures. Alternative 5 There are 8.9 miles (32.4 acres) of suitable stream habitat for bug-on-a-stick in treatments under Alternative 5. As with the Proposed Action, no impacts would occur because of Riparian Reserve protection measures. Alternative 6-No Action No impacts to bug-on-a-stick or western waterfan lichen would occur if the proposed action or any alternatives are not implemented. There is effectively no difference between the action and no action alternatives. Resource Protection Measures Best management practices and resource protection measures for Riparian Reserves will protect both species from any impacts caused by the proposed treatments. Incorporation of these protection measures will exclude treatments in bug-on-a-stick and western waterfan lichen habitat, resulting in no effect to these species or their habitat from the proposed treatments. Cumulative Impacts Management of lichens and bryophytes began only after implementation of Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines in 1998. Population records for either didn’t exist on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest before that. Populations discovered since that time have been associated with field surveys for proposed management actions or programmatic or strategic surveys to meet the requirements of the 2001 Survey and Manage Record of Decision. All known populations have been protected from impacts through exclusion from treatments or protection of necessary habitat characteristics. Best management practices for riparian areas were first published in the early 1990’s. Prior to that few, if any, timber practices were prohibited in stream courses. With over 1.1 million acres of timber harvest on the west side Shasta-Trinity National Forest and neighboring private timberlands, there is a high likelihood that historic populations of bug-on-a-stick and wester waterfan lichen were lost between 1950 and the 1990’s. 23,000 miles of roads were constructed on the west side of the Forest between 1970 and 2000. Design standards for National Forest System roads were first published in the 1970’s in an effort to reduce soil erosion, mass wasting, and sediment delivery into streams. Prior to that time western waterfan lichen populations may have been lost when stream sediment accumulations degraded water quality and lichen habitat quality. Wildfires on about 985,000 acres on the west side of the Forest have contributed to sediment deposition in perennial streams, especially where fires have burned at high intensity and on steep slopes. Wildfires in the past have contributed to poor water quality and potential loss of western waterfan lichen populations. The Beegum Watershed Restoration Project will implement road maintenance, road improvements, and road decommissioning on 247 miles in the Beegum watershed in the near future. Restoration work under this project will repair and decommission roads that are contributing sediment into streams and degrading water quality and quality of habitat for western waterfan lichen. Past management actions and wildfires, lack of road design standards, and lack of riparian stream protection standards have contributed to probably losses of bug-on-a-stick and western waterfan lichen populations on the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Best management practices, road design standards, Riparian Reserve protection measures, and State water quality standards have dramatically reduced impacts from actions within some stream habitats and reversed water quality trends in other. With resource protection measures applied, there will be little or no impact to any populations of western waterfan lichen or bug-on-a-stick from the proposed treatments, regardless of the action alternative. The proposed treatments under each alternative are negligible in comparison to past actions. Impacts from the proposed treatments in addition to past disturbance will not result in a cumulative impact to either species. Determination The proposed project may affect individuals but will not result in a trend toward federal listing for western waterfan lichen or bug-on-a-stick. Comparison of Alternatives No populations of either species will be subjected to impacts under any action alternative. Suitable habitat is greatest under Alternative 3, but all Riparian Reserves and perennial streams are protected from treatment impacts, leading to no effective difference in impacts between alternatives. Closed Cone Forest/Gravelly Flat and Chaparral Bench Associated Species: Tracy’s Wooly-Stars Seven populations of Tracy’s wooly-stars are known from the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, but none are within any proposed treatment areas. There is a small population about ½ mile from Goods Gulch and proposed treatments on FS31N42. The species is found in open gravelly habitats, usually outside of forest communities and in chaparral, sometimes in association with gray pine. Suitable habitat in the project area ranges from 43 acres under the Proposed Action and Alternatives 2, 4, and 5 to 73 acres under Alternative 3. Table 3-75. Summary of Populations and Habitat of Tracy’s wooly stars. Closed cone forest; gravelly flats and benches in chaparral Tracy’s wooly-stars  Proposed Action  Alt 2  Alt 3  Alt 4  Alt 5  Treatment Acres  8000  9600  15,200  8000  8000  Suitable Habitat Acres Present  43  43  73  43  43  Number of Populations Present  Tracy’s wooly-stars  0  0  0  0  0  Direct and Indirect Impacts Proposed Action – Alternative 1 There are 43 acres of suitable habitat for Tracy’s wooly-stars in treatments under the Proposed Action. There is a slight possibility that Tracy’s wooly-stars occupies old landings or unauthorized roads that are proposed for use. If so, any individuals present would not survive the heavy disturbance associated with these. Decommissioning after use will help to loosen soil and speed up soil recovery, as well as potential recruitment of individuals from populations that may be located close to treatment areas. Prescribed burning is unlikely to occur in suitable habitat for Tracy’s wooly-stars because of the lack of fuel to carry fire. If it does occur within habitat, burning at low to moderate intensity would consume some aboveground vegetation, including Tracy’s wooly-stars. All prescribed burning treatments, including pile burning, would occur from fall to spring after seed have dispersed and there is more soil moisture to buffer heat penetration. No data is available to confirm if fire stimulates Tracy’s wooly-stars seed germination, but it likely plays a part. Mastication blades are unlikely to come in contact with individual plants because of their small size, but the residue generated from this and chipping could smother plants temporarily, possibly inhibiting seed germination. Mastication residue subsides greatly by the following year, eliminating any smothering impacts. Tree planting would not occur in Tracy’s wooly-stars habitat, so there is no potential for impacts from that treatment. Other low impact treatments, hand piling, lopping, pruning, and borate stump application will have no direct or indirect impact on Tracy’s wooly-stars because there are few trees to apply these treatments to in chaparral communities. Alternative 2 There are 43 acres of suitable habitat for Tracy’s wooly-stars in treatments under the Alternative 2. Potential treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-75, are the same as described for the Proposed Action. Alternative 3 There are 73 acres of suitable habitat for Tracy’s wooly-stars in treatments under Alternative 3. Potential treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-75, are the same as described for the Proposed Action. Alternative 4 There are 43 acres of suitable habitat for Tracy’s wooly-stars in treatments under the Alternative 4. Potential treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-75, are the same as described for the Proposed Action. Alternative 5 There are 43 acres of suitable habitat for Tracy’s wooly-stars in treatments under Alternative 5. Potential impacts, as described in Section B-Overall Impacts of Different Treatment Types, are the same as described for the Proposed Action. Alternative 6-No Action No impacts would occur if the proposed action or any alternatives are not implemented. With incorporation of resource protection measures, there would be little effective difference between the action alternatives and the No Action alternative for this species. Resource Protections There are no known populations of Tracy’s wooly-stars in the treatment areas, but should any be discovered before or during operations, they would be flagged and all treatments excluded. Cumulative Impacts The locations of existing and historical records suggest that this species has been affected primarily by development, road construction, use and maintenance, competition from invasive plants, and possibly fire suppression. The species appears to tolerate or benefit from infrequent disturbance and wildfire, but is subject to negative effects from the weeds that invade following disturbance, and from frequent disturbance, including being driven and parked on. Tracy’s wooly-stars habitat is considered unproductive for commercial forest development and has been largely ignored for this purpose. Historic fuels management may have affected some sites because habitat appears to provide easy to construct fuelbreak areas with little need for vegetation maintenance. Some portion of the 114, 908 acres of fuel management work on the west side of the Forest has likely impacted suitable habitat and possibly caused population losses. Portions of the 984,523 acres of wildfire on the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest have occurred within suitable habitat for Tracy’s wooly-stars. Direct impacts of fire in this habitat are more positive than negative (i.e. reduction of decadent woody shrubs). Wildfires have become hotter and more frequent in the past 20 years, encouraging the introduction and spread of non-native invasive species that discourage native species recovery. Although the majority of the habitat for the species is off of the National Forest, habitat is found within the Ironside/Big Bar, Price Creek, Sailor Bar, Post Creek Salt Creek, and New Tedoc grazing allotments. Trampling effects may have caused damage to some individuals since 1907 when livestock grazing was first integrated into natural resource management on the Forest. Disruption of the soil crust in Tracy’s wooly-stars habitat from livestock trampling has encouraged an increase in invasive non-natives that speed up soil erosion and degrade habitat for the species. Ironside/Big Bar, Price Creek, and Sailor Bar allotments have been vacant since 2013, but impacts may still be occurring from grazing in the Post Creek, Salt Creek, and New Tedoc allotments. About 23,000 miles of roads were built on the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest since the 1950’s. New road construction was at its peak in the 1970’s and 1980’s to access mining operations and facilitate timber harvest. It has dropped off significantly since the mid-1990’s and no new roads have been built on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest since 2003. Roads built to access mining may have been built in suitable habitat, resulting in potential loss of populations. The Beegum Watershed Restoration Project will implement road maintenance, road improvements, and road decommissioning on 247 miles in the Beegum watershed in the near future. This watershed is located where Tracy’s wooly-stars habitat and known sites are concentrated. Road restoration actions in this area may facilitate recovery of habitat lost to past road building and potential expansion of existing sites. The geographic range and numbers of this species on the Shasta-Trinity NF are not likely to change in the next two decades, although local extirpations and new recruits may happen after infrequent disturbances to its habitat, including human-created habitat along roadsides and on fuelbreaks. Habitat for Tracy’s wooly-stars contains very few trees and shrubs are usually stunted and dispersed. Proposed treatments won’t be needed in most or all treatment areas because few hazard trees were created and there is only low natural fuel accumulation. Standard best management practices are incorporated into the project design, further reducing the potential for adverse impacts to the species. With resource protection measures applied, few impacts from the proposed treatments are expected to occur. With resource protection measures applied, there will be little or no impact to any populations of Tracy’s wooly-stars. The proposed treatments under each alternative are negligible in comparison to impacts from past actions. Impacts from the proposed treatments in addition to past, present, and future disturbance will not result in a cumulative impact to either species. Determination Suitable habitat is present and field surveys have not been completed in all areas and undiscovered populations of Tracy’s wooly-stars may be present. Resource protection measures will be applied to reduce impacts from the few proposed treatments where they may occur; other treatments are light with no expected potential for heavy disturbance to known populations. It is my determination that the proposed project may affect individuals but will not result in a trend toward federal listing for Tracy’s wooly-stars. Comparison of Alternatives Resource protection measures will exclude treatments within known populations of Tracy’s wooly-stars, but a natural lack of hazardous fuels and hazard trees will eliminate most or all impacts from the proposed action. Because of the lack of hazard and fuel reduction needs, there is effectively no difference between any of the six alternatives. Roadcut Associated Species -Serpentine and Non-Serpentine: Shasta chaenactis, Niles’ harmonia, Stebbins’ harmonia 24 populations of Shasta chaenactis are known from the Shasta-Trinity NF. Five of these are on the west side of the Forest, all of them on roadcuts or ridgelines with exposed bedrock. No populations of Shasta chaenactis are found within any proposed treatment areas. 27 populations of Niles’ harmonia and 13 populations of Stebbins’ harmonia are documented on the Shasta-Trinity NF, all within the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane. Both species grow on serpentine soils of primarily serpentinite or peridotite minerology. Habitat is open with few or no conifer trees and sparse, often unvegetated understories with little fuel to carry fire. One population of Niles’ harmonia is found within proposed treatment areas under all action alternatives. No populations of Stebbins’ harmonia are found within any proposed treatment area. Direct and Indirect Impacts There are no known populations of Shasta chaenactis within the proposed treatment areas, Habitat can be found with bare soil and exposed bedrock on cut and fill slopes (roadcuts) that are made up wholly of serpentine soils, or soils that have serpentine inclusions. Suitable habitat in the project areas is along all 224 miles of roads where cut and fill slopes are greater than six feet long. There is no difference in the amount of suitable habitat between alternatives. Assuming a mathematical average of 8 feet of roadcut on both sides of the road, there would be 434 acres of suitable habitat under each of the five action alternatives. There is a single population of Niles’s harmonia in the Fork Fire within proposed treatments along the Bramlet Road (Forest Road 29). There are no known populations of Stebbins’ harmonia within any proposed treatment areas. The two species grow almost exclusively within and are endemic to the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane, which runs north/south through the overall project area. Within the 224 miles of roads in the proposed project, 9 miles of roadcuts have serpentine soils, equivalent to 18 acres. As with Shasta chaenactis, there is no difference in amount of suitable habitat between alternatives. Table 3-76.

There are 434 acres of suitable habitat along 224 miles of roads receiving hazard tree removal, road buffer, and fuelbreak construction treatments. No impacts are expected to occur to Shasta chaenactis from proposed action treatments or connected actions. The species grows firmly rooted in bedrock and rock outcrops, but of which would be avoided during operations because of potential breakage to trees, logs, and equipment. Regardless of the action alternative, potential impacts could occur to Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia from connected action road maintenance associated with implementing the proposed treatments. These activities include cleaning ditches of woody debris that spills over from upslope road buffer, salvage, and fuelbreak treatments and brushing roads to remove vegetation that obstructs vehicle line-of-sight. Potential impacts include tearing or crushing foliage and dislodging individual plants. Shasta chaenactis is a perennial species that lodges in exposed bedrock, so there is low potential for being dislodged or uprooted. Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia are small annuals that could easily be pulled out of the loose soil they grow in, so there is more potential from unintentional road maintenance impacts. In the process of removing felled trees from sites, one end of some trees may be dragged over cut slopes where Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia populations may be present. Some damage to the species may occur, but this is expected to be minimal. Alternative 6-No Action No impacts would occur if the proposed action or any alternatives are not implemented. Resource Protections Each of the three species will be protected from impacts by a resource protection measure that restricts ditch cleaning and brushing with heavy equipment to the lowest 24 inches of slopes. Above 24 inches brushing will be done manually with hand tools or chainsaws and removed from the site by hand. These species are occasionally found at the bottom of roadcuts and when this occurs there is good potential those populations will be excavated from the site. But most often they occur higher on the roadcut and the majority of currently unidentified populations will not be impacted by road maintenance activities. A resource protection measure that prohibits use of blades to clean ditches above 24 inches from the base of roadcuts will be incorporated into the project design. This will greatly minimize or even eliminate the primary source of impacts to the three species. A resource protection measure to directionally fell hazard trees away from rock outcrops will prevent impacts to Canyon Creek stonecrop during operations. While not on a roadside, the known population of Niles’ harmonia will be flagged and all treatments excluded from the population. Cumulative Impacts Seismic activity and metamorphic soils are both common to northwest California have triggered numerous small landslide on roads throughout the project area. Some populations of Niles’ and Stebbins harmonia on roadcuts where serpentine soils are present in slides. Routine scheduled road maintenance may have contributed to loss of individuals located at the bottom of slopes in combination with ditch cleaning. Road construction was heavy in the 1970’s and 80’s to access timber sales and mining. Many miles of roads were built directly through serpentine habitats and parts or whole populations of Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia were lost. Awareness of naturally-occurring asbestos in serpentine soils has all but eliminated plans to build roads in serpentine soils. No future actions focused entirely on road maintenance are on the planning horizon, but routine road maintenance activities such as ditch cleaning and road brushing continue to be done throughout the Forest to insure the safety of Forest road travelers and avoid buildup of debris that could damage roads in storm events. Some loss of individual plants could occur. Road grading, dust abatement, and ditch cleaning will be required during operations as connected actions, with no difference among alternatives. Road construction through serpentine soils was heavy in the past but almost less than 15 miles of new road have been built since 2000 and none of that has been through serpentine soils. Routine road maintenance to protect the integrity of Forest System roads will continue into the future as funding allows. Resource protection measures will be applied that will result in very few or no impacts from the proposed treatments. Relative to natural impacts and impacts from heavy road construction in the past, impacts from the proposed treatments are negligible in comparison. The combination of past, present, and future actions in combination with the proposed treatments is not expected to result in cumulative impacts. Determination With resource protection measures applied, there will be little or no impact to any populations of three species from the proposed treatments, regardless of the action alternative. The proposed project may affect individuals but will not result in a trend toward federal listing for Shasta chaenactis, Niles’ harmonia, or Stebbins’ harmonia. Comparison of Alternatives All action alternative treat the same roads and roadside area doesn’t change between alternatives, 9 miles of roadsides containing serpentine soils (Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia) and 224 miles of roadsides containing non-serpentine soils (Shasta chaenactis). All alternative contain 1 population of Niles’ harmonia and no populations of the other two species. There is no difference between the five action alternatives. Serpentine Soil Associated Species: Niles’ Harmonia, Stebbins’ Harmonia, Peanut Sandwort Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia grow on uplands as well as roadcuts, the common tie is bare soil free of competing vegetation and surface litter and duff. They only grow on serpentine soils. No populations of either species are known from any proposed treatment areas under any alternatives, but treatments being implemented in the Fork Fire are within the southern half of the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane where multiple populations of both species and abundant serpentine habitat can be found. There is a single population of Peanut sandwort between East Tule Creek and Plummer Creek. Acres of suitable habitat within proposed treatment areas range from 27 under the Proposed Action and Alternatives 4 and 5, to 39 under Alternative 3. Direct and Indirect Impacts Proposed Action – Alternative 1 There are 27 acres of suitable habitat for Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia and Peanut sandwort in the proposed treatment areas. The three species occupy serpentine openings either within Jeffrey pine, incense cedar, and gray pine woodlands or in non-forested open areas sometimes called barrens. Serpentine habitats carry very sparse vegetation on the ground and don’t accumulate fuels that carry fire or require hazardous fuel reduction. There is a low likelihood that suitable habitat for Niles and Stebbins harmonia and Peanut sandwort will include many hazard trees that need to be felled. Where isolated hazard trees may exist, a small number of individuals of the three species could be crushed or uprooted. High quality serpentine soils (described below) that provide habitat for Niles’ and Stebbins harmonia and Peanut sandwort will be flagged and all treatments other than felling hazard trees will be excluded. Excluded treatments include removing felled tree, lopping, pruning, hand piling, chipping, all prescribed burning treatments, mastication, handline construction, landing construction, reuse of existing unauthorized roads, and removal of trees felled for operational safety. Flagged areas will be marked on implementation maps. Aside from physical impacts of falling hazard trees, there will be no other impacts from proposed treatments under any alternative. Table 3-77.

Treatments under this alternative are the same as under the Proposed Action, but Alternative 3 includes development/decommissioning of up to 3 miles of existing unauthorized routes for temporary road use. Individual planned treatments that are appropriate in habitat for the three species and their potential impacts, are described in Table 3-77, are the same as described for the Proposed Action, there will be no other impacts from proposed treatments under Alternative 3. Alternative 4 There are 27 acres of suitable habitat for Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia and Peanut sandwort in the proposed treatment areas. Treatments under this alternative are the same as under the Proposed Action, but salvage removal will be excluded in selected habitats for northern spotted owls. Northern spotted owl habitat is very different than habitat for serpentine species, and there would be no additional benefit to the three species from the excluded treatments. Potential treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-77, are the same as described for the Proposed Action there will be no other impacts from proposed treatments under Alternative 4. Alternative 5 There are 27 acres of suitable habitat for Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia and Peanut sandwort in the proposed treatment areas. There are no additional unique planned treatments under this alternative, but salvage removal will be excluded in selected habitats for northern spotted owls, Riparian Reserves, Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRA), and At-Risk watersheds. A little over an acre of serpentine habitat is at the far east edge of Salt Gulch IRA near Natural Bridge, but Northern spotted owl habitat is very different than that for Niles’ and Stebbins harmonia and Peanut sandwort and there would be no additional benefit to the three species from the excluded treatments in those habitats. Suitable habitat is outside of Riparian Reserves and any At-Risk watersheds. Alternative 6-No Action No impacts from the proposed treatments would occur if the proposed action or any alternatives are not implemented. Any unidentified Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia and Peanut sandwort populations would continue to persist until habitat or environmental conditions change and suitable habitat is no longer available. With incorporation of resource protection measures, there would be little effective difference between the action alternatives and the No Action alternative for these species. Serpentine habitats are naturally free of trees and other hazardous woody fuels to carry fire. Fuel reduction treatments are rarely, if ever needed and the sites don’t produce trees that could fall if they die. Resource Protections Resource protection measures to protect Nile’s and Stebbins’ harmonia, and Peanut sandwort, are incorporated into the project design. Known sites within proposed treatment areas will be flagged on the ground and shown on implementation maps. 43-73 acres of high quality serpentine habitats are present within planned treatment areas, depending on the alternative. These are unique habitats with a high biodiversity value and they will be protected from impacts along with identified Nile’s and Stebbins’ harmonia, and Peanut sandwort populations. These habitats and their resource protection measures are described below. In general, management and protection measures correspond to two broad serpentine habitat descriptions, Types 1 and Type 2. Different types and mixes of serpentine habitats warrant different management requirements based on the quality and/or sensitivity of each site and these are described below. Hazard trees will be felled where found in all Type 1 and Type 2 serpentine habitats. Type 1 and Type 2 serpentine sites will be identified on project implementation maps as control areas. Serpentine Habitat Type #1. Open areas with a high content of serpentinite and peridotite minerology, sparsely vegetated with occasional shrubs and few or no conifers: • Exclude heavy equipment from these sites. No machinery off of well-established tracks, routes or roads; No vehicle or equipment staging, log decking, skid trail, landing or road construction through these sites. Previously constructed sites that are heavily disturbed may be used after botanist approval. • No pile burning. • Hazard trees will be left in place after falling. • No landing construction or use, unless approved by a botanist. Serpentine Habitat Type #2. Forest or shrubland habitats with widely spaced trees (30 trees per acre or less). There may be scattered large conifers, as well as distinct clumps of small to large shrubs; all of which may have burned in concentrations producing hazard trees. Forest or shrubland habitats with a moderate or high number of openings between trees. There may be scattered clumps of large mature trees [Jeffrey pine, incense cedar, hardwoods], as well as distinct clumps of small to large shrubs; all of which may have burned in concentrations producing hazard trees. • Exclude heavy equipment from these sites. No machinery off of well-established tracks, routes or roads; No vehicle or equipment staging, log decking, skid trail, landing or road construction through these sites. Previously constructed sites that are heavily disturbed may be used after botanist approval. • No pile burning. • Felled hazard trees will be left in place unless they can be removed from the site by full suspension or endlined by equipment that remains on well-established existing roads. • No landing construction or use, unless approved by a botanist. Cumulative Impacts Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia, Peanut sandwort inhabit serpentine openings in or adjacent to forests, and often on ridgetops. These sites are ideal for roads, landings, parking, skid trails, and off-highway vehicle recreation. Until the latter part of the 20th century there was little awareness of the sensitivity of these serpentine habitats and the slow recovery rates after disturbance. Approximately 23,000 miles of roads have been built on the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National forest since the 1950’s to access timber sales and mining. Road building was especially heavy in the 1970’s and 80’s and a large part of that was through serpentine habitats on the South Fork Management Unit (SFMU). Many populations of the three species were disturbed or lost during that time. Serpentine soils were commonly mined for asbestos until asbestos was banned from use in manufacturing in the 1980’s because of health concerns. Mining for other heavy metals such as chromium and nickel has been done in the same area. Numerous mine sites for asbestos, heavy metals, and road base material are present on serpentine sites on the SFMU; populations of the three species have been lost at mine sites. Off-road vehicle use was relatively unmanaged until cross-country vehicle travel was prohibited in 2005 (USDA, 2010). Before then hundreds of miles of unauthorized routes were created on the SFMU, many of them through serpentine habitats because of their lack of surface vegetation and gentle slopes. Many populations of the three species were disturbed with this activity, where repeated travel occurred on individual routes, populations have more likely been lost. Climate change may have a more immediate effect on Nile’s and Stebbins’ harmonia, Peanut sandwort than on other rare species due to the very restricted geographic ranges and pronounced fidelity to ultramafic substrates. Increasing temperatures could affect the species negatively, as could changes in amount and type of precipitation; specific effects are not known. These plants grow in openings, barrens, and rock outcrops in mid-elevation Jeffrey pine/incense-cedar forests or isolated barrens. If temperatures increase, there is limited additional higher ground with suitable substrate. With incorporation of resource protection measures serpentine habitats and known sites of Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia, and Peanut sandwort, will be only minimally impacted from proposed treatments. Past actions of mining, roadbuilding, cross-country off-road vehicle use have resulted in loss of populations of the three species. Continued illegal off-road vehicle use and climate change impacts in the future will contribute to negative impacts and habitat degradation as well. Relative to past, present, and future non-project-related actions, impacts of the proposed treatments with resource protection measures will be minor to the point that together there will be no cumulative impacts. Determination With resource protection measures applied, there will be little or no impact to populations or habitat of Niles’ or Stebbins’ harmonia, or Peanut sandwort from the proposed treatments, regardless of the action alternative. The proposed project may affect individuals but will not result in a trend toward federal listing for Niles’ or Stebbins’ harmonia, or Peanut sandwort. Comparison of Alternatives With incorporation of resource protection measures, there will be no difference in amount or severity of impacts to the three species. There is no difference in number of known sites among the 5 action alternatives. If resource protection measures were not applied, Alternative 3 holds 30 more acres of suitable habitat that could be impacted by proposed treatments than the other 4 action alternatives and could therefore be considered the most impactful alternative, but these impacts will be avoided by implementation of the resource protection measures. Table 3-78. Summary of Populations and Habitat of Canyon Creek stonecrop. Serpentine Soils Barrens and Rock outcrops; Canyon Creek stonecrop  Proposed Action  Alt 2  Alt 3  Alt 4  Alt 5  Treatment Acres  8000  9600  15,200  8000  8000  Suitable Habitat Acres Present  83  83  90  83  83  Number of Populations Present  Canyon Creek stonecrop  0  0  0  0  0  Barrens and Rock Outcrop Associated Species: Canyon Creek Stonecrop Rock outcrops provide habitat for Canyon Creek stonecrop. Outcrops that are suitable for stonecrop growth are usually at least 10 feet in diameter. They can be lower to the ground and appear as exposed bedrock or they can extend up along vertical slopes. There are 83 acres of rock outcrops within the Proposed Action and Alternatives 2, 4, and 5. There are 90 acres of barrens under Alternative 3. There are no known populations of Canyon Creek stonecrop within the project area. Direct and Indirect Impacts All Alternatives No impacts would occur to the species under the Proposed Action. A resource protection measure to require directional felling away from rock outcrops will avoid any impacts from felled trees. All of the proposed treatments under the action alternatives would intentionally avoid working on or near rock outcrops because of the potential for damage or additional costs to operate. No impacts will occur from tree felling or removal, lopping, pruning, hand piling, chipping, any prescribed burning treatments, mastication, handline construction, landing and temp road construction, or reuse of existing unauthorized roads. Canyon Creek stonecrop accepts shade or sunlight, so any changes in canopy cover from fuelbreak construction treatments would have no impact. Alternative 6-No Action No impacts would occur if the action alternatives are not implemented. Resource Protections Because of the Resource Protection Measure to directionally fall trees away from rock outcrops and because no other treatments would take place on them, there would be no effective difference between the No Action and action alternatives and no direct or indirect impacts to Canyon Creek stonecrop from the proposed treatments. Cumulative Impacts Twenty-six populations of Canyon Creek stonecrop are known for the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Approximately half of those are within the geographic area of the proposed treatments, but none are in proposed treatment areas. Because of the unique habitat Canyon Creek stonecrop occupies, there are few known threats to the species, natural or human-generated. Trees are directionally felled away from rock outcrops to avoid loss of value from breakage. Lack of surface fuels prevents most wildfire impacts. Lack of vegetation that can grow on the harsh environment eliminates the need for manual or mechanical fuel reduction treatments. High cost discourages excavation of rock outcrops for road construction. For all the same reasons, there are no past, present, or future planned activities that have potential to impact Canyon Creek stonecrop. With few or no impacts from past, present, and future planned actions and a resource protection measure to avoid impacts to the species, the proposed treatments are not expected to result in any cumulative impacts. Determination There will be no impacts to Canyon Creek stonecrop under any action alternative. The proposed project will have no effect on Canyon Creek stonecrop. Comparison of Alternatives Incorporation of the resource protection measure for falling away from large outcrops will result in no difference in effects among action alternatives, regardless of the number of acres treated or acres of suitable habitat for Canyon Creek stonecrop. Forest Plan Endemic Species Endemic species are rare species that are confined mostly or wholly to a localized geographic area. Forest Plan Endemics are rare endemic species confined wholly or mostly to the Shasta-Trinity National Forest and management direction is described for them in the LRMP. Forest Plan Endemics are afforded the same conservation and protection measures as Sensitive species. The following Forest Plan Species are identified for the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest: Veiny arnica (Arnica venosa). Grows in open, disturbed sites, often in old roadbeds, in eastern Trinity County. The Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project area is outside of the geographic range of this species. Dubakella buckwheat (Eriogonum libertini). Grows on serpentine soils within the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane. This species will be addressed in this report. Serpentine goldenbush (Ericameria ophitidis). Grows on serpentine soils within the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane. This species will be addressed in this report. Impact Analysis Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush grow only in high quality serpentine habitats containing exclusively serpentinite or peridotite minerology within the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane. No populations of either species are known from within any proposed treatment areas under any alternatives, but habitat is present, especially within the Fork Fire area. Acres of suitable habitat within proposed treatment areas range from 27 under the Proposed Action and Alternatives 4 and 5, to 39 under Alternative 3. Direct and Indirect Impacts Dubakella Buckwheat and Serpentine Goldenbush Table 3-79.

The two species occupy serpentine openings either within Jeffrey pine, incense cedar, and gray pine woodlands or in non-treed open areas sometimes called barrens. Woodlands always have widely spaced trees and both types have very little vegetation on the ground. Felled hazard trees may land on individual plants and injure or kill them, but this is expected to be rare. Serpentine habitats are naturally bare and don’t accumulate fuels that either carry fire or require hazardous fuel reduction. Because habitat is substantially free of trees and other vegetation, there will be little incentive for fuels reduction treatments or their connected actions. High quality serpentine soils (described below) that provide habitat for serpentine goldenbush and Dubakella buckwheat will be flagged and all treatments other than felling hazard trees will be excluded. Flagged areas will be marked on implementation maps. Aside from physical impacts of falling isolated hazard trees, there will be no other impacts from proposed treatments under the Proposed Action. Alternative 2 There are 29 acres of suitable habitat for Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush in the proposed treatment areas under Alternative 2. Additional fuelbreak treatments, including a graduated, shaded fuelbreak on selected roads and temporary road construction and decommissioning, are included under Alternative 2. As described under the Proposed Action, serpentine habitats that support the two species are not appropriate for fuelbreak treatments because there are very few trees, if any, growing on these sites. Without fuelbreak construction or the need to remove felled hazard trees or reduce fuels, new temporary roads and landings aren’t needed and won’t be constructed in these areas. High quality serpentine soils (described below) that support the two species don’t warrant fuelbreak treatments because there are very few trees, if any, growing on these sites. There will be no impacts from the additional graduated shaded fuelbreak treatments and connected actions under Alternative 2. Flagged areas will be marked on implementation maps. Aside from physical impacts of falling isolated hazard trees, there will be no other impacts from proposed treatments under Alternative 2. Alternative 3 There are 39 acres of suitable habitat for Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush in the proposed treatment areas under Alternative 3. Alternative 3 also includes an additional treatment of development/decommissioning of up to 3 miles of existing unauthorized routes for temporary road use. Because habitat is substantially free of trees and other vegetation, there will be little incentive for fuelbreak construction, its connected actions, or other fuel reduction treatments. Felled hazard trees may land on individual plants and injure or kill them, but this is expected to rare. High quality serpentine soils (described below) that provide habitat for serpentine goldenbush and Dubakella buckwheat will be flagged and all treatments other than felling hazard trees will be excluded. Flagged areas will be marked on implementation maps. Aside from physical impacts of falling isolated hazard trees, there will be no other impacts from proposed treatments under Alternative 3. Alternative 4 There are 27 acres of suitable habitat for Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush in the proposed treatment areas. Treatments under this alternative are the same as under the Proposed Action, but salvage removal and other fuels treatments (and their connected actions) will be excluded in selected habitats for northern spotted owls. Individual planned treatments that are appropriate in habitat for the two species, and their potential impacts, as described in Section B-Overall Impacts of Different Treatment Types, are the same as described for the Proposed Action. Alternative 5 There are 27 acres of suitable habitat for Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush in the proposed treatment areas. There are no additional unique planned treatments under this alternative, but salvage removal will be excluded in selected habitats for northern spotted owls, Riparian Reserves, Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRA), and At-Risk watersheds. A little over an acre of serpentine habitat is at the far east edge of Salt Gulch IRA near Natural Bridge, but Northern spotted owl habitat is very different than that for Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush and there would be no additional benefit to the three species from the excluded treatments in those habitats. Suitable habitat is outside of Riparian Reserves and any At-Risk watersheds. Flagged areas will be marked on implementation maps. Aside from physical impacts of falling hazard trees, there will be no other impacts from proposed treatments under Alternative 5. Alternative 6-No Action No impacts would occur if the proposed action or any alternatives are not implemented. Any unidentified Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush populations would continue to persist until habitat or environmental conditions change and suitable habitat is no longer available. With incorporation of resource protection measures, there would be little effective difference between the action alternatives and the No Action alternative for these species. Serpentine habitats are naturally free of trees and other hazardous woody fuels to carry fire. Fuel reduction treatments are rarely, if ever needed and the sites don’t produce trees that could fall if they die. Resource Protection Resource protection measures to protect Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush, are incorporated into the project design. Known sites within proposed treatment areas will be flagged on the ground and shown on implementation maps. 43-73 acres of high quality serpentine habitats are present within planned treatment areas, depending on the alternative. These are unique habitats with a high biodiversity value and they will be protected from impacts along with identified Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush populations. These habitats and their resource protection measures are described in the following. In general, management and protection measures correspond to three broad serpentine habitat descriptions, Types 1, Type 2, and Type 3. Different types and mixes of serpentine habitats warrant different management requirements based on the quality and/or sensitivity of each site and these are described below. Hazard trees will be felled where found in all serpentine habitats, regardless of the type. Serpentine habitats requiring additional protections will be identified on project implementation maps as control areas. Serpentine Habitat Type #1. Open areas with a high content of serpentinite and peridotite minerology, sparsely vegetated with occasional shrubs and very few or no conifers: • Exclude heavy equipment from these sites. No machinery off of well-established tracks, routes or roads; No vehicle or equipment staging, log decking, skid trail, landing or road construction through these sites. Previously constructed sites that are heavily disturbed may be used after botanist approval. • No pile burning. • Hazard trees will be left in place after falling. • No landing construction or use, unless approved by a botanist Serpentine Habitat Type #2. Forest or shrubland habitats with widely spaced trees (10 trees per acre or less), as well as individual small to large shrubs. There is a small potential for wildfire to have entered these sites and generated fire-killed hazard trees. • Exclude heavy equipment from these sites. No machinery off of well-established tracks, routes or roads; No vehicle or equipment staging, log decking, skid trail, landing or road construction through these sites. Previously constructed sites that are heavily disturbed may be used after botanist approval. • No pile burning. • Felled hazard trees will be left in place unless they can be removed from the site by full suspension or endlined by equipment that remains on well-established existing roads. • No landing construction or use, unless approved by a botanist Serpentine Habitat Type #3. Soils contain serpentine fragments, but a full diversity of trees, shrubs, and forbs is present. No restrictions on any operations unless other protection measures apply. Cumulative Impacts The spatial and temporal boundaries are the same as those defined under the biological evaluation for Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia; the geographic area of the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane and the time extent of available records, about the 1950’s. Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush occupy the same habitat as Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia and Peanut sandwort. Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush inhabit serpentine openings in or adjacent to forests, and often on ridgetops. These sites are ideal for roads, landings, parking, skid trails, and off-highway vehicle recreation. Until the latter part of the 20th century there was little awareness of the sensitivity of these habitats and the slow recovery rates for serpentine habitats. 23,000 miles of roads have been built on the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National forest since the 1950’s to access timber sales and mining. Road building was especially heavy in the 1970’s and 80’s and a large part of that was through serpentine habitats on the South Fork Management Unit (SFMU).

Mining for other heavy metals such as chromium and nickel has been done in the same area. Numerous mine sites for asbestos, heavy metals, and road base material are present on serpentine sites on the SFMU; populations of the three species have been lost at mine sites. Off-road vehicle use was relatively unmanaged until cross-country vehicle travel was prohibited in 2005 (USDA, 2010). Before then hundreds of miles of unauthorized routes were created on the SFMU, many of them through serpentine habitats because of their lack of surface vegetation and gentle slopes. Many populations of the three species were disturbed with this activity, where repeated travel occurred on individual routes, populations have more likely been lost. Climate change may have a more immediate effect on Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush than on other rare species of the very restricted geographic ranges and pronounced fidelity to ultramafic substrates. Increasing temperatures could affect the species negatively, as could changes in amount and type of precipitation; specific effects are not known. These plants grow in openings, barrens, and rock outcrops in mid-elevation Jeffrey pine/incense-cedar forests or isolated barrens. If temperatures increase, there is limited additional higher ground with suitable substrate. With incorporation of resource protection measures, serpentine habitats and known sites of Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush, will be only minimally impacted from proposed treatments. Past actions of mining, roadbuilding, cross-country off-road vehicle use have resulted in loss of populations of the three species. Continued illegal off-road vehicle use and climate change impacts in the future will contribute to negative impacts and habitat degradation as well. Relative to past, present, and future non-project-related actions, the proposed treatments with resource protection measures will be minor and together there will be no cumulative impacts. Determination With resource protection measures applied, there will be little or no impact to any populations of Dubakella buckwheat or serpentine goldenbush from the proposed treatments, regardless of the action alternative. Field surveys have not been completed and suitable habitat is present for Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush. It is my determination that the proposed project may affect individuals but will not result in a trend toward federal listing for Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush. Comparison of Alternatives With incorporation of resource protection measures, there will be no difference in amount or severity of impacts to the two species. There is no difference in number of known sites among the 5 action alternatives. If resource protection measures were not applied, Alternative 3 holds 30 more acres of suitable habitat that could be impacted by proposed treatments than the other 4 action alternatives and could therefore be considered the most impactful alternative. Survey & Manage Vascular Plant, Bryophyte, Lichen, and Fungi Species Guidance under the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) and the Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) requires the Forest Service to analyze proposed actions for potential impacts to Survey and Manage species, using direction provided in the 2001 Record of Decision and Standards and Guidelines for Amendments to the Survey and Manage, Protection Buffer, and other Mitigation Measures, Standards and Guidelines (”2001 ROD”) (USDA, 2001a), as amended by annual species reviews to 2003. The amended 2001 ROD identifies twelve physiographic provinces within the range of the northern spotted owl, including three in California; California Klamath, California coast Range, and California Cascades and provides a list of old-growth forest dependent species subject to that direction. Each species on the list is assigned to one of six categories (A-F), depending on rarity and practicality of identification without extensive lab testing. The Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project is within the California Klamath Province. Management Direction Four requirements of Survey and Manage direction must be addressed for all proposed management actions that have potential to cause ground disturbance in old-growth forest habitat. 1. Category A and C species. Perform field surveys prior to habitat disturbing activities. Field surveys are not required if the proposed action is not likely to result in a significant negative impact on a species’ habitat or persistence of the species at the site. 2. Category B species. Complete strategic surveys for the province that encompass the project area, or perform equivalent-area surveys in old-growth habitat to be disturbed. 3. Category A, B, and C species-Manage all known sites. 4. Category D and E, manage high priority known sites. Pre-disturbance surveys are not required if delay in implementation of a proposed action to perform surveys would result in an unacceptable environmental risk or the proposed action is designed to maintain late-succession habitat characteristics required to allow those species to persist on the site. Currently, nine Category A and C species have suitable habitat within the California Klamath Province. All fungi species (other than Bridgeoporus nobilissimus) were moved to Categories B or D before 2003 through the Annual Species Review process. Pre-disturbance field surveys are no longer required because the Category B strategic survey requirement has been completed, but known sites of species in Categories A, B, C, D, and E are required to be managed. Category A&C Species-Perform Field Surveys Prior to Disturbance Field surveys must be performed prior to habitat disturbing activities within old growth forest. Field surveys are not required if the proposed action is not likely to result in a significant negative impact on a species’ habitat or persistence of the species at the site. Category A and C species that could be present in the California Klamath Province are shown in Table 3-80. Table 3-80.

To date, neither species is known from the Shasta-Trinity National Forest; current professional thought is that suitable habitat doesn’t exist for them within the California Klamath Province. There will be no impacts to these species from the proposed action and field surveys are not required. Eucephalis vialis is a rare perennial aster that is known to occupy habitat primarily between 500 and 1500 feet, in primarily coastal habitats in California. In 2004 it was considered restricted to Oregon (primarily Willamette Valley), but a herbarium specimen from 1919 expanded the range of the species to California. Five populations are currently known from California in strongly coastal plant communities. There is no coastal habitat, therefore no suitable habitat for Eucephalis vialis, in the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage project planning area. There will be no impacts to this species from the proposed action and field surveys are not required. Suitable habitat is present in the project area for four of the 9 species, and without mitigations, some proposed treatments have potential to negatively affect the species’ habitat or persistence of the species on the site. Impacts to Pacific fuzzwort (Ptilidium californicum), Brownie lady’s-slipper (Cypripedium fasciculatum), mountain lady’s-slipper (Cypripedium montanum), and bug-on-a-stick (Buxbaumia viridis) were discussed in detail in the biological evaluation. A summary of conclusions follows. Pacific fuzzwort, Brownie and Mountain lady’s-slipper, Bug-on-a-stick Suitable habitat is present and field surveys have not been completed in all areas and undiscovered populations of the four species may be present. Past actions were intensive over a large area that includes all known populations and in areas that contain suitable habitat and likely eliminated populations of the species. Resource protection measures are incorporated into the design of the proposed project to eliminate impacts from heavy equipment use and other treatments are light. Resource protection measures include: • Retention of course, woody, debris in advanced states of decay (snag and log decay classes 3-5) for protection and maintenance of protected wildlife and anadromous fish habitat. • Hazard trees cut within the first 150 foot equipment exclusion zone (EEZ) within perennial Riparian Reserves. • No green trees will be cut or removed in EEZs up to the high water mark; hand treatments will be allowed to fell hazard trees but will be left, unless there is heavy fuel loading in excess of 20 tons/acre. • Hand piling and pile burning will not occur within EEZs. • No new landings will be constructed will be constructed within Riparian Reserves (RPM #36. • Roads, landings, and main skid trails will be located outside of Aquatic Management Zones to the extent practicable (BMP Veg-3). • Heavy equipment will not be allowed to operate within 150’ of perennial streams. Within Riparian Reserves tree felling will be restricted to hazard trees only and left on site. If individuals of protected species are discovered after project implementation begins, all off-road ground-disturbing operations will be stopped temporarily in the area of discovery until a Forest Service Botanist or representative recommends appropriate protection measures. With incorporation of resource protection measures, the proposed project is not expected to cause a significant negative effect on either species habitat or the persistence of those species at the site. Category A through E Species-Manage high-priority known sites. There are three known sites each of Brownie and mountain lady’s-slipper orchids within the proposed project area. All six sites will be flagged and only low intensity treatments will be allowed to occur within flagged populations. These treatments include hazard tree felling (no removal), lop and scatter slash, pruning, hand piling, chipping, tree planting, borate application to stumps, and hand felling of trees and brush that have grown since fuelbreaks were created (future fuelbreak maintenance, Alternative 2 only). In addition, jackpot and broadcast burning will be allowed because low intensity fire benefits Cypripedium species. Resource protection measures described in the section above will minimize potential impacts to known Brownie and mountain lady’s-slipper orchid populations within proposed treatment areas under all alternatives. With incorporation of resource protection measures, the proposed project is not expected to cause a significant negative effect on either species habitat or the persistence of those species at the site. Conclusion The proposed action complies with the 2001 Record of Decision and Standards and Guidelines for Amendments to the Survey and Manage, Protection Buffer, and other Mitigation Measures Standards and Guidelines, as amended by annual species reviews to 2003. Climate Change Impacts California is currently (2012-2014) experiencing the hottest and driest period in its recorded climate history (since 1895 (Butz et al, 2015) (Mann and Gleick 2015). The Northwestern California ecoregion, which includes the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, shows an increase in mean (0.32° F, 0.18° C) and minimum (0.85° F, 0.47° C) temperature and a decrease in maximum (-0.41° F, -0.23° C) temperature over this same time period (Rapacciuolo et al. 2014). Loarie et al. (2008) projected that 2/3 of California’s native flora will experience >80% reduction in range size by 2100. Endemic plant species that specialize in uncommon or sparsely distributed habitat (e.g. serpentine soils, montane meadows) will have difficulty responding to changing climatic conditions by migrating (Conlisk et al. 2013). Such narrowly distributed species are also at high risk due to disturbances like fires or floods that may extirpate entire populations. Conversely, areas resistant to change, such as north facing slopes or areas with deep, well-watered soils, may provide potential refugia (Olson et al. 2012, van Mantgem and Sarr 2015). In the Klamath region, if warming climatic trends are accompanied by drying during the growing season, mesic topographic microclimates are likely to become increasingly important microrefugia (Dobrowski 2010, Copeland and Harrison, 2015). Other studies indicate the current climate is within the historic range of variability for temperatures and precipitation. One study found that During the Medieval Warm Period (1,100-650 YBP), temperatures were higher (up to 3.2°C) and drier than current conditions (Estes, 2013; Axelrod 1977). Introduction of non-native invasive species since historic periods, many of which are highly flammable, has made comparison of historic and current climate conditions more difficult. Mediterranean climate regions like California exhibit high levels of plant richness and endemism and are also among those most sensitive to climate and land-use change (Butz et al, 2015) (Underwood et al. 2009). Where it is able, the distribution of vegetation in California is expected to move upslope and north in response to climate change (Hayhoe et al. 2004, Loarie et al. 2008). Fire exclusion has resulted in increased tree densities and a reduction in shade intolerant species (Parsons and DeBenedetti 1979; North et al. 2007), although the ecological significance of these changes is more important in drier, historically pine-dominated forests than in moister, fir-dominated forests. The most recent Climate Change Vulnerability Index for California State-listed plants (CDFW, 2010) indicates most State-listed species are considered moderately vulnerable to predicted climate change impacts, meaning the abundance and/or range extent within the assessed geographic area is likely to decrease by 2050. It also indicates a decrease in climate suitability for most of the 156 plant species assessed to date (Anaker et al, 2011). Species that occupy naturally hotter and drier habitats were more often rated as not vulnerable and likely to have increased habitat in the same timeframe. Throughout all proposed treatment areas under all alternatives, elevation ranges between 1200 and 5760 feet. Under the premise that suitable habitat for naturally rare species will decrease and species will move up in elevation and northward from their current geographic distribution, six of the sixteen species being addressed in this analysis are adapted to hot, dry habitats and likely less vulnerable to hotter, drier climate predicted under the California Department of Fish and Wildlife Climate Change Vulnerability model (Canyon Creek stonecrop, Niles’ harmonia, Stebbins’ harmonia, Peanut sandwort, Shasta chaenactis, and Tracy’s wooly-stars). The remaining 10 species (California globe mallow, mountain lady’s-slipper, Brownie lady’s-slipper, Umpqua green gentian, bug-on-a-stick, Pacific fuzzwort, red-pored bolete, branched collybia, olive phaeocollybia and western waterfan lichen) requiring mesic conifer forest habitat are considered more vulnerable to climate change impacts. The range of these species could be expected to move up in elevation as well as farther north in latitude. Western waterfan lichen that grows completely inundated in forested, perennial streams would be additionally impacted by potential changes in flow regime from perennial to intermittent as climatic precipitation decreases. Because this species cannot adapt to intermittent stream flow, the likelihood of losing existing populations is high. The elevation range is the same among the five action alternatives, 1280 to 5760 feet. Therefore, there will be no difference between action alternatives in the degree or magnitude of shift upward or northward in response to climate change into the future. Noxious Weed Risk Assessment Introduction Non-native invasive plants, also referred to as noxious weeds, have the ability to disrupt local ecological communities by quickly changing the species diversity and structure of habitats that wildlife and other organisms have adapted to and depended on over thousands of years. Noxious weeds can reproduce very quickly on disturbed sites, often more quickly than native species. They can change a local community from one that had many different plant species in different sizes and shapes that supported many different animals, insects, and other biological organisms who in turn assisted and benefited those native species, to broad areas with only a few species (or even just one) in just a few sizes and shapes. Noxious weeds are the thugs of local ecosystems; without weed management native species can’t compete with weeds and will often just stop growing there. Most plant communities in the western U.S. have at least a seed source of noxious weeds, but healthy native plant communities have the ability to keep weeds from dominating because most weeds must have bare soil and full sun to germinate and grow. Many things contribute to noxious weed infestations, but most basically they have to be brought onto a site (introduction) and have bare soil and lots of sunlight to germinate and grow (establishment). Over time, many noxious weeds have developed techniques to keep native species from growing in the same area once they become established, such as sending chemicals into surrounding soil that native plants can’t tolerate or taking up a large amount of physical space and shading out natives. Techniques like this allow weed populations to expand over time. Noxious weeds move to new locations (spread) when weed seeds or pieces that regrow on their own come into contact with something that can move them (animal fir, automobile tires). Noxious weeds, like other plant species, produce seeds that can remain dormant for years or decades to germinate later when the right environmental conditions for germination present themselves. Noxious weeds do their best work when they are free of challenges to access bare soil and full sunlight. Once the ground starts to get shaded or covered with organic matter or roots of native plants, existing weeds can continue to grow, but new introductions usually have trouble germinating or getting established. Noxious weeds affect many resources that contribute to an ecosystem functioning well, such as soil productivity, wildlife habitat, native plant diversity, and water quality and availability (Bossard & Randall 2007); so it is important to analyze and understand the effects of this project on weed occurrences. Changes to vegetation structure, soil disturbance, and dispersal factors can each contribute to the introduction, spread and establishment of noxious weeds. Wildfires increase weed risk in several ways (Table 3-81). Table 3-81. Wildfire effects on native species and weeds. Wildfire Impact  Effects related to native species and weeds  Loss of canopy cover with moderate and high severity burns  Increased sunlight dries out the soil quicker and increases the soil temperatures. Native species accustomed to moist soil and shade can’t survive.  Blackened soils  Stores heat from increased sunlight longer than soil with organic matter cover. Winter snow melts quicker and doesn’t get absorbed for native plant growth.  Loss of litter, duff, and other organic matter on the ground  Organic matter acts as a buffer and additional layer of moisture storage over the soil. It releases it slowly into the growing season and allows soil to provide moisture to native plants longer into the summer. If litter and duff burn off, soil moisture evaporates much earlier in the growing season because it doesn’t have a top layer of organic matter to hold it in. Water can run off bare soil faster and remove top soil that provides nutrients to native plants. Many weeds have learned to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, but many native plants have not.  Authorities and Guidelines Direction relevant to the proposed action in regards to the management and prevention of weeds includes the following: FSM 2903.4 requiring a determination of the risk of introducing, establishing, or spreading invasive species associated with any proposed action, as an integral component of project planning and analysis, and where necessary provide for alternatives or mitigation measures to reduce or eliminate that risk prior to project approval. FSM 2903.5 requiring that all Forest Service management activities are designed to minimize or eliminate the possibility of establishment or spread of invasive species on the National Forest System, or to adjacent areas. Executive Order 13112 of February 3, 1999, directs Federal agencies to prevent the introduction of invasive species; detect and respond rapidly to, and control, such species; not authorize, fund, or carry out actions that the agency believes are to cause or promote the introduction or spread of invasive species unless the agency has determined and made public its determination that the benefits of such actions clearly outweigh the potential harm caused by invasive species; and that all feasible and prudent measures to minimize risk of harm will be taken in conjunction with these actions. Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan for Forest Pests (4-18): a) When conducting watershed/ecosystem analysis, consider the possible effects that the Forest pest may have on management objectives and desired future conditions. b) Implement an integrated pest management (IPM) program to maintain or reduce forest pest impacts to acceptable levels and to maintain or enhance forest health and vigor. Any decision to use pesticides will require site specific analysis. The proposed action and all alternatives would be compliant with all of the above authorities. Data Sources Data used for this analysis comes from the California Invasive Plant Council (CalIPC) Invasive Plant Inventory (2016), USDA Forest Service Natural Resource Information System (NRIS) database, USDA Forest Service Forest Service Activity Tracking System (FACTS), Shasta-Trinity GIS noxious weed database, and field visits to the planning area. CalIPC is a statewide invasive plant research, education, and policy development organization that focuses on management of wildland weeds, including all National Forest lands in California. Species and weed management reference information is taken from DiTomaso and Kyser (2013) and CalIPC. Noxious Weed Management Criteria Funding for noxious weed management is never limitless and resource management agencies usually have to prioritize which species are treated and to what degree. Research and experience have identified several strategies for prioritizing noxious weed treatment. Prevention is the most effective way to control weeds. It is usually easier to prevent weeds from entering an area than to control or eradicate weeds once they are present. When prevention isn’t an option because populations have already been introduced, focus efforts on populations that meet these criteria: 1. Small populations; geographically restricted to no more than ¼ acre. Treatments have a high potential for removing all aboveground stems and future individuals germinating from the seedbank. 2. Populations that are a threat to high value resources, such as wilderness areas and known locations of Sensitive or other protected botanical species. 3. Highly invasive species that have the ability to grow and expand significantly in a short time. Where herbicides are not an option for treatment, an additional criteria for management is to focus treatments on species that can effectively be managed with manual removal. Species that resprout when cut, pulled, or dug up will rarely be controlled even if removed repeatedly over many years. Populations of noxious weeds that can effectively be managed by manual methods will diminish in size until the seedbank is exhausted and will require decreasing amounts of monitoring over time if removal efforts were regular and complete. Herbicides are not currently an option for treatment of noxious weeds on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest because environmental analysis has not been completed. No herbicides will be used for weed management in the proposed project. Most weed management prioritization strategies discourage spending valuable time and funding on populations with widespread distributions. Limitless funding would still not reduce population levels enough to allow prevention measures to effectively keep future spread and establishment at the same low levels. Invasive weed species that meet one or more of the above criteria and are effectively managed with manual treatments are considered high-priority weed species. Management of high priority weed species are the best use of limited funding and resources. Affected Environment The footprint of the project area encompasses 15,990 when alternatives are combined and overlap between alternatives is removed (alternatives overlap in some areas, but some alternatives may have unique treatment sites). Species that are high priority for treatment on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest based on the criteria described above are shown in Table 3-82. Spotted knapweed, diffuse knapweed, and Dyer’s woad are all found in proposed treatment areas or within ¼ mile of them, and are the greatest concern for introduction and spread. Like most invasive weed species, all three established first along roads. Individual populations extend varying distances from the road edge, typically up to the edge of adjacent forest canopy. Table 3-82. High priority invasive weed species on the Shasta-Trinity NF and their presence within the project area. Species that pose a threat within or near proposed treatment areas are bolded. Common Name  Scientific Name  In or Directly Adjacent to Proposed Treatments  CalIPC Weed List111  Italian thistle  Carduus pycnocephalus  No  moderate  Spotted knapweed  Centaurea stoebe ssp. micranthos  In-Wildwood Road  high  Dyer’s woad  Isatis tinctoria  Adjacent-Wildwood Road  moderate  Diffuse knapweed  Centaurea diffusa  In-Route, Mad River, and Fork complexes; South Fork Mountain Road.  moderate  Brooms-French, Spanish, and Scotch  Genista monspessulama, Spartium junceum, Cytisus scoparius  No  high  Fennel  Foeniculum vulgare  Adjacent-Wildwood Road-historic site  high  Rush skeletonweed  Chondrilla juncea  no  moderate  Nodding plumeless thistle  Carduus nutans  No  high  Maltese star thistle  Centaurea melitensis  No  moderate  Scotch thistle  Onopordum acanthium  No  high  Direct and Indirect Impacts Invasive weeds are stronger competitors than native plant species most of the time and easily germinate, root, and spread in the presence of disturbed soil. Treatments that are moderately to heavily ground disturbing have the highest potential to provide suitable habitat for weed introduction and spread. There must also be a source of recruitment nearby, either an introduction vector or an established recruitment source nearby. The extent and intensity of ground disturbance associated with an individual treatment will determine the amount of suitable habitat for weeds. Over time, areas that have been allowed to stabilize 111 CalIPC weed ratings: High: Species that have severe ecological impact on ecosystems Moderate: Species that have substantial and apparent, but not severe ecological impact on ecosystems Limited: Species that are invasive but their ecological impacts are minor on a statewide basis with ground cover for many years after an initial disturbance gradually hold less suitable habitat for weeds. Treatments that use heavy equipment have the greatest potential to cause ground disturbance because they expose bare soil and degrade structure at the soil surface. Treatments that use heavy equipment are commercial salvage, skid trail and landing development, and temporary road construction and decommissioning (new and re-use of unauthorized routes). Machine piling, which has the potential to cause heavy soil disturbance, will be restricted to landings and areas that are already heavily disturbed, greatly reducing new soil disturbance and potential for weed spread. All other treatments proposed in the project area have some potential to create suitable habitat, but to a much lesser degree than those employing heavy equipment. Acres of heavy-equipment use proposed under each action alternative are shown in Table 3-83. Table 3-83. Treatments Using Heavy Equipment under the Action Alternatives Alternative  Alternative Footprint (acres)  Salvage Treatments with Tractors  Temporary Road Construction/ReUse/Decommissioning, Skid Trails, Landings1  Total Heavy Equipment Use  Acres of Potential Disturbance  Proposed Action  7,969  4,072  0 miles Up to 20 new ¼ acre landings/5 acres Up to 60 re-used ¼ acre landings/15 acres  4,092  2  9,522  9,522  3 miles/4.4 acres Up to 20 new ¼ acre landings/5 acres Up to 60 re-used ¼ landings/15 acres  9,546  3  15,166  7,684  3 miles/4.4 acres Up to 20 new ¼ acre landings/5 acres Up to 60 re-used ¼ landings/15 acres  7,708  4  7,969  782  0 miles Up to 20 new ¼ acre landings/5 acres Up to 60 re-used ¼ landings/15 acres  802  5  7969  0  0  0  1Temp roads and landings may be placed outside of treatment areas, resulting in acreage estimates that exceed alternative footprint acres. Alternative 2, which includes the full range of proposed roadside treatments plus fuelbreak construction within a consistent 300 foot buffer (150 feet on each side), has the potential to create the most soil disturbance and therefore contribute to the most potential suitable habitat for invasive weeds. Although Alternative 3 covers a much larger footprint than Alternative 2, commercial salvage treatments would be implemented on only about half of the area, rather than everywhere within the 9,522 acre footprint under Alternative 2. The proposed action implements commercial salvage treatments on even fewer acres. Alternatives 4 and 5 include areas that will be excluded from salvage treatments for protection of northern spotted owls and other resources, greatly reducing the potential invasive weed habitat as a result of implementing the project. No heavy machinery will be used under Alternative 5. Cumulative Impacts The proposed project area extends over a very large geographic area, but unlike most other proposed management actions is subdivided into smaller inclusions (5 individual fire complexes + an individual fire) within that larger geographic area. Cumulative impacts analysis areas for invasive weeds are best delineated by the roads that provide access into a project area because transportation routes are considered the primary vector for invasive species movement from place to place. Spatial Boundary Overall, the spatial boundary for invasive species analysis would span from north of the River Complex to south of the Mad River and Fork Complexes, but contiguous geographic areas are a less meaningful delineation of cumulative impacts analysis for weeds than transportation routes. The transportation routes that provide major access to the treatment areas are shown in Table 3-84. Treatment areas are accessed using the same roads under each alternative and there are no access routes that are unique to an individual alternative. Table 3-84.

Roads were originally constructed on the Forest to facilitate timber sales, mining, and other planned management activities, but vehicles are driven on those same roads today for multiple other purposes, including accessing recreation sites, managing natural resources, and fire suppression. Road building has been a part of Forest management since the early part of the 20th century. While it would be appropriate to include past actions since the 1920’s (90 years) as contributing to the existing map of noxious weed populations, it may be more meaningful to look at past actions as far back as the time it would take for a disturbed community to recover and once again be a part of a self-sustaining native plant community. This would probably be somewhere between 30 and 40 years, assuming low levels or no disturbance; longer with periodic disturbances (the more likely scenario. Past, Present, and Future Actions Road construction since the 1920s to access timber sales, recreational sites, and mining claims has been responsible for noxious weeds that are present in the planning area today. Wildfire, timber harvest, fuel reduction activities, and road construction have had the greatest influence on the amount of disturbed ground for introduction and establishment of invasive weeds. Table 3-85 summarizes most of the past, present, and future planned activities in the cumulative impacts analysis area. Timber harvest within the cumulative impacts analysis area occurred regularly from the 1950’s through 1990’s. A large percentage of timber harvest prescriptions before the 1990’s were for clearcuts and overstory removal, dramatically increasing sunlight to the forest floor and stimulating weed germination and growth. Timber harvest required landings, skid trails, and temporary roads to be operational, most of which were new construction. Road construction ramped up considerably in the 1970s and 1980 to accommodate timber harvest and mining needs, but few roads have been built since timber harvest activity decreased significantly with implementation of the Northwest Forest Plan in the mid-1990’s. Fuel reduction activities have increased in the past 20 years in an attempt to reduce fuels that have accumulated as a result of fire suppression and reduced timber yields after implementation of the Northwest Forest Plan and a desire to reduce wildfire threats to communities. Wildfires have always been present, but the size and number of fires annually has increased dramatically since the 1987. When combined with the increase in road construction in the 1970’s and 80’s, significantly more habitat for invasive weed introduction and spread is present today than before the 1970’s. Table 3-85.

Because invasive species have developed sophisticated strategies to outcompete most native plants and persist under adverse environmental conditions, they have the ability to modify their surroundings physically and chemically to facilitate weed growth and discourage growth of native species. Almost always, once invasive weeds are established the only way to reduce their impacts is through regular management over many years. The proposed action alternatives would be implemented entirely along roads. In combination with treatments concentrated where fires burned in 2015, the presence of weeds in multiple sites throughout the project area is a given. There are no laws or regulations to prevent weeds from being introduced into the project area by non-operational vehicles because roads will remain open to the public. Several prevention measures are incorporated into the project design to prevent introduction and spread of weeds within the project area. Alternative 5 treatments exclude salvage treatments and temporary roads. Alternative 4 includes some salvage treatments, but less than 20% of the acres under the Proposed Action alternative would be salvaged. Overall, in comparison to past, present, and planned future activities, the proposed action will create far fewer acres of ground disturbance and is not expected to result in cumulative impacts to the rate of invasive weed spread. Invasive Species Mitigations No herbicides will be used to treat or manage any invasive plant species. Prevention measures are designed to reduce the chance of introducing weeds, but no measures can completely eliminate this threat. Weeds can be introduced on anything that enters an area including motor vehicles and equipment, foot traffic, and animals. Measures are usually the same regardless of how individual species establish and spread once introduced (seed germination vs. regeneration from broken plant parts). To discourage introduction or establishment of noxious weeds into the project area a provision requiring equipment cleaning will be included in all service contracts or agreements used to implement the project. This provision requires all equipment or vehicles working off of established roads to be free of invasive species of concern and to present equipment for inspection by the Forest Service. Operational equipment will clean equipment to remove seeds, soil, vegetative matter, and other debris that could contain or hold seeds before moving off-road equipment into the project area. This provision also applies to equipment departure departing from project areas already infested with invasive weeds. Old landings and unauthorized roads will be used for salvage operations whenever possible, reducing the amount of new ground disturbance. All heavy equipment operating off roads will be cleaned and inspected before entering the treatment area to be sure they are free of debris that could contain weed propagules. Prior to implementation of mechanical operations each season, some sites containing high priority invasive weeds may be managed to reduce the potential for weed spread. High priority weed sites are those that contain invasive species that are known to be very invasive, limited in geographic extent within the project area, and/or are within close proximity to high value natural resources such as Sensitive plant populations. Management options include but are not limited to scheduling treatments before seed has set, avoiding infested sites with designated control areas, hand pulling weed sites before operations begin, prohibiting parking on roadsides known to be heavily infested with high priority weeds, and covering infested sites. Strategic scheduling of operations will occur between infested and non-infested areas. Managed sites will be identified on a map. Invasive species that respond positively to removal will be physically removed and disposed of off-site (if necessary to avoid leaving plant parts that can regrow); removed plants with no propagative parts will be left on site. High priority invasive species sites that cannot be treated effectively with manual removal treatments (i.e. hand pulling stimulates resprouting) will be flagged and vehicles and equipment will be excluded from those sites to reduce chance of weed spread. Weed removal in high priority weed sites will occur no more than 30 days before timber operations begin. To discourage establishment of invasive weeds in selected disturbed areas within the project area, native grass and forb seed and/or non-persistent cereal grains may be spread where there is heavy soil disturbance. These areas include but are not limited to temporary roads, landings, and main skid trails. Cereal grains will be restricted to annual “recleaned” varieties (have been processed to reduce weed seeds and other debris) that are expected to disappear from sites within 3-5 years. Grass and forb seed will be species that are known from the Klamath Ranges, preferably species found on similar habitats on the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Only seed that has been tested and meets California State standards for noxious weed content and seed quality will be used. Species selection will ultimately depend on seed availability, but under no circumstances will non-native perennial species be used. All seeded areas will be mulched with weed-free straw or on-site organic materials. Post-Implementation Seeding and Mulching Recommendations Where sites are heavily disturbed after project implementation, 2011 Best Management Practices (BMPFSH 2509.22) (USDA b, 2011) will be followed for erosion control and to discourage establishment of noxious weeds. BMPs to be followed include: 1.15 Revegetation of Areas Disturbed by Harvest Activities 1.16 Log Landing Erosion Control 2.3 Road Construction and Reconstruction 5.4 Revegetation of Surface-disturbed Areas Each of these BMPs recommend revegetation with locally-appropriate seed or vegetative material and application of and organic mulching material over exposed soil surfaces to stabilize soil, control runoff, and/or meet wildlife needs. Disturbed sites that are determined to need revegetation will be seeded with a total of 10#/acre of seed that includes at least 1 pound but no more than 3 pounds of re-cleaned wheat and 1 pound of either of the following species: • Spanish clover (Lotus purshianus) • Annual or miniature lupine (Lupinus bicolor) The remaining mix will include one or more of the following species, using a seed source as geographically close as possible to the proposed project area: • Blue wildrye (Elymus glaucus) • Mountain or California brome (Bromus carinatus) • Beardless wildrye (Leymus triticoides) • Squirreltail (Elymus elymoides) • California melic grass (Melica californica) Seed will have a genetic origin from within California, preferably north of Sacramento. Documentation of the seed source showing genetic origin shall accompany all seed and will be provided to the Sale Administrator upon request. Any changes from the list must be approved by the Forest Service botanist in advance. Mulching material may include weed-free straw, wood chips, pine straw, or any other organic material. On-site organic materials are preferable when adequate sources exist to reduce importation of invasive weeds and reduce transportation costs and energy consumption. Noxious weed introduction and spread will be reduced or avoided through the current standard contract provision for equipment cleaning, or its equivalent if a stewardship or other federal agreement is used to implement the project. This provision requires the operator to insure his equipment is free of weed seeds or propagules prior to entering the project area. Equipment will be inspected by Forest Service Sale Administration staff to be sure equipment has been cleaned. Air Quality _________________________________ Analysis Framework: Statute, Regulation, Forest Plan and Other Direction The Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage project area is located in Trinity County, California. The analysis area for the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of project activities on air quality is the North Coast Unified Air Quality Management District (AQMD). The Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) identifies the Standards and Guidelines that specifically apply to Air Quality for this project. The air quality standard on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest is very high. Forest activities which contribute to air quality degradation are: burning of forest vegetation, exhaust from vehicle and machinery use, and dust generation from logging equipment and other vehicular use of unpaved roads. The project area is located within the North Coast Air Basin. There are no major heavy industrial areas in either of these air basins. Logging is the primary industrial activity that takes place on National Forest and private lands. Logging, transportation vehicles, burning of logging slash, and burning for fuels reduction and wildlife habitat improvement account for a large percentage of the pollutants emitted into the air. The Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel Wilderness has been designated as a Class I air quality area. Because of this, management of the air quality in this area requires identification of air quality related values (AQRVs) by measuring sensitive indicators of those values. The AQRVs are inventoried and monitored in cooperation with the Mendocino National Forest. The Forests are in compliance with all national ambient air quality standards. However, like most air basins in the State, those within the Forests exceed the California ambient air quality standard for PM-10 (particulates less than 10 microns in size). Primary sources for PM-10 are burning and dust generating activities. Since no major industries are planned, other dominant pollutants would not be a problem (Forest Plan 3-5). The Forest Plan contains the following direction concerning air quality: • Maintain air quality to meet or exceed applicable standards and regulations (Forest Plan 4-4). • Protect air quality while achieving land and resource management goals and objectives. Base line levels will be established, and available technology will be used to predict and monitor changes. Activities such as burning, which are under the Forest’s control, will be coordinated with affected landowners and control agencies (Forest Plan 4-13). • Identify, assess, and monitor significant air quality related values (AQRV) and sensitive indicators of those values in the Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel Wilderness in cooperation with the Mendocino National Forest (Forest Plan 4-13). • Establish and maintain close coordination with Federal, State, and local officials in the research and application of new air quality standards particularly in relation to smoke and dust management (Forest Plan 4-13). • Incorporate smoke management controls into the development of prescribed burn plans, and coordinate with local authorities (Forest Plan 4-14). • Yolly Bolly-Middle Wilderness is located in a Class I Federal airshed, subject to Section I 69A of the Clean Air Act. It is governed by EPA regulations to assure progress toward the Congressionally declared goal of; ..." the prevention of any future, and the remedying of any existing, impairment of visibility in mandatory Class I Federal areas in which impairment results from manmade air pollution." Working together, personnel of the Mendocino and Shasta-Trinity National Forests continue to gather baseline data on air quality to monitor the achievement of Class I standards for this Wilderness (Forest Plan 4-97). • Protect air quality of this Class I area in accordance with the Clean Air Act. Determine sensitive indicators for monitoring (Forest Plan 4-97). Table 3-86.

Prescribed fires are regulated and authorized by the local Air Pollution Control District (APCD) and the California Air Resources Board under the process established by the California Smoke Management Program (Title 17). The legal basis of the program is found in the Smoke Management Guidelines for Agricultural and Prescribed Burning adopted by the California Air Resources Board (ARB) on March 23, 2001 (CARB 2001). The Guidelines provide the framework for State and local air district regulators to conduct the program. Elements of the program include: • Registering and Permitting of Agricultural and Prescribed Burns; • Meteorological and Smoke Management Forecasting; • Daily Burn Authorization; and • Enforcement. The 1990 Clean Air Act (CAA) amendments and the 1998 EPA Interim Policy on Wildland and Prescribed Fire form the federal requirements and guidance behind the California program (Ahuja et al. 2006). Burn days are allocated by the responsible air quality regulatory agency when dispersion conditions are most likely to prevent exposure to unhealthy smoke concentrations. Allocations are considered on a cumulative potential for the air basin by regulatory review of a unified reporting system, the Prescribed Fire Information Reporting System (PFIRS), maintained by the California Air Resources Board (CARB 2012). The reporting system and a daily conference call between regulatory meteorologists, resource agency meteorologists, and resource agency fire managers allow for a daily discussion of ongoing events, smoke dispersion, allocations, and burn approval outlook. The objective of this system is to facilitate fuel treatment and minimize smoke exposure to the public. Effects Analysis MethodologyEmissions were calculated for machine pile burning, jackpot burning, and for wildfires using the EPA’s Technology Transfer Network Clearinghouse for Inventories & Emissions Factors. Using the EPA’s Technology Transfer Network Clearinghouse for Inventories & Emissions Factors the emissions for biomass removed for wood products was also estimated. To estimate biomass removed for wood products tons per acre of non-merchantable timber were calculated from post fire plot sampling. These data were then used, along with treatment acres, to derive the average biomass emissions for each alternative. Greenhouse gasses (GHG) are released in smoke emissions. GHG are important to track because they trap solar radiation which increases global warming. The GHG’s found in smoke emissions are carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane. Calculation of Emissions from Prescribed Fires The emissions from prescribed fire were calculated using the following formula: Ei (tons) equals (A multiplied by FL multiplied by percent C multiplied by EF) all divided by 2000 to convert pounds to tons. A∗FL∗%C∗EF = Ei 2000 Where: Ei equals Emissions in tons for each emission type (e.g. PM2.5 or NOx or CH4) A equals Area in acres FL equals Fuel Loading in tons per acre %C equals Percent fuel consumed EF equals Emission factor for ith type (in pounds per ton of dry fuel consumed) Assumptions used in calculations: • Average Fuel loading assumed under different treatments is 20 tons per acre (per field surveys) per desired fuel loadings listed in the fuels section of this chapter as well as the fuels report. • Percent combustion under pile burning is 100 percent. • Percent combustion under jackpot burning is 50 percent. • Jackpot burns are similar to broadcast or under burns. • EFs for pile and jackpot burns were derived from Hardy et al. 2001: PM10 equals (12.4, 20.5), PM2.5 equals (10.8, 18.8), CH4 equals (11.4, 12.8), NMHC equals (8, 9.8), CO equals (153, 201), CO2 equals (3271, 3165), NOx equals(6, 6), SOx equals (2.4, .2.4). • GWP (Global Warming Potential) factors for greenhouse gas conversion to CO2 equivalent metric tons from the 2007 synthesis report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2007) assuming a 20-year time horizon. • Wildfire emissions were based on a wildfire burning under 90th percentile weather conditions at year 20 for all scenarios. • Road construction, reconstruction, logging, and haul traffic, would have a minor effect on air quality due to the project’s management requirements and implementation of standard dust abatement requirements within all Forest Service timber sale contracts. Therefore, these emissions are not calculated. Air Quality IndicatorsThe Clean Air Act lists 189 hazardous air pollutants to be regulated. Some components of smoke, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are known to be carcinogenic. Probably the most carcinogenic component is benzo(a)pyrene (BaP). Other components, such as aldehydes, are acute irritants. In 1994 and 1997, 18 air toxins were assessed relative to the exposure of humans to smoke from prescribed and wildfires. The following seven pollutants are most commonly found in smoke from fire: • Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10 a criteria pollutant): Particulates are the most prevalent air pollutant from fires and are of the most concern to regulators. Research indicates a correlation between hospitalizations for respiratory problems and high concentrations of fine particulates. PM2.5 are fine particles that are 2.5 microns in diameter or less in size. PM10 are fine particles that are between 10 and 2.5 microns in diameter or less in size. Particulates can include carcinogens and other toxic compounds. Overexposure to particulates can cause irritation of mucous membranes, decreased lung capacity and impaired lung function. • Methane (CH4): Methane is an odorless, colorless flammable gas. Short-term exposure to methane may result in feeling tired, dizziness and headache. No long-term health effects are currently associated with exposure to methane. Methane is a greenhouse gas (GHG) and contributes to global climate warming (IPCC 2007). • Carbon Monoxide (CO a criteria pollutant): Carbon monoxide reduces the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood, a reversible effect. Low exposures can cause loss of time awareness, motor skills and mental acuity. Also, exposure can lead to heart attacks, especially for persons with heart disease. High exposures can lead to death due to lack of oxygen. • Carbon Dioxide (CO2): Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless and non-poisonous gas formed by combustion of carbon and in the respiration of living organisms. Carbon dioxide is the primary GHG emitted through human activities. Greenhouse gases act like a blanket around the Earth, trapping energy in the atmosphere and causing it to warm. The buildup of GHGs can change the Earth's climate and result in dangerous effects to human health and welfare and to ecosystems (IPCC 2007). • Nitrogen Oxide (NO2 a precursor to O3): Nitrous oxide gives rise to nitric oxide (NO) on reaction with oxygen atoms, and this NO in turn reacts with ozone. As a result, it is the main naturally-occurring regulator of stratospheric ozone. It is also a major greenhouse gas and air pollutant. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2 a criteria pollutant) is a reddish-brown gas. Small levels can cause nausea, irritated eyes and/or nose, fluid forming in lungs and shortness of breath. Breathing in high levels can lead to rapid, burning spasms, swelling of throat, reduced oxygen intake, a larger buildup of fluids in lungs and/or death. N2O is a GHG and contributes to global warming. • Ozone (O3 a criteria pollutant) is the most widespread air quality problem in the state according to the CARB (2010). It is not emitted directly but is formed from reactions of hydrocarbons and NOx in the presence of sunlight. It can cause reduced lung function and irritated eyes, nose and throat. It is known to cause damage to some vegetation, including ponderosa pine and Jeffrey pine trees (Procter et al. 2003). • Sulfur Oxides (SOx a criteria pollutant): Short-term exposure to high enough levels of sulfur dioxide (SO2) can be life threatening. Generally, exposures to SO2 cause a burning sensation in the nose and throat. SO2 exposure can cause difficulty breathing, including changes in the body’s ability to take a breath or breathe deeply, or take in as much air per breath. Long-term exposure to sulfur dioxide can cause changes in lung function and aggravate existing heart disease. Asthmatics may be sensitive to changes in respiratory effects due to SO2 exposure at low concentrations. Sulfur dioxide is not classified as a human carcinogen (it has not been shown to cause cancer in humans). SO2 is not an issue in the state and has not been analyzed. Affected Environment Existing Conditions According to the EPA Green Book, updated November 17, 2015, Trinity County is Designated a Non-Attainment Area for PM10; the project area falls within this county. The Yolla-Bolly-Middle-Eel Wilderness Area is a Federal Class 1 area adjacent to the project area. There are 42 communities in Trinity County. The population of Trinity County according to the 2010 Census is just under 14,000 people. The Forest Service follows the guidelines assigned by the CARB [ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP), visibility SIPs, and Title 17] to limit state-wide exposure on a cumulative basis, in compliance with the Clean Air Act (CARB 2001; 2008). Air quality from the Fork Complex, South Complex, Mad River Complex, Route Complex, River Complex, and Saddle Fires through the majority of the summer reached unhealthy levels according to multiple alerts from AQMD. People were advised to avoid strenuous outdoor activity or to remain indoors because fine particles in smoke can irritate the eyes and respiratory system and aggravate chronic heart and lung disease. Figure 3-22 shows the smoke from the Fork and River Complex Fires Figure 3-22 Smoke from the Fork and River Complex Fires billows over Trinity County and Environmental Consequences Effects Common to all Alternatives Emissions for all the Alternatives including Alternative 6 (the no action alternative serves as the control) are shown in Table 3-87 through Table 3-93. The tables are grouped by treatments: Prescribed Fires: Table 3-87 to Table 3-89; Wildfires: Table 3-90; Green House Gases are under Prescribed Fires, Table 3-91 to Table 3-93. Direct and Indirect Effects Prescribed Fires Table 3-87 displays emissions under pile burning, Table 3-89 shows emissions under jackpot burning, and Table 3-89 displays the expected combined emissions for all alternatives under machine pile and jackpot burning. Burning would be completed under approved burn and smoke management plans. Given the ability to control ignition times to favor good smoke dispersion, it is not anticipated that prescribed burning would impact the local communities. Smoke would be transported to the northeast by typically southwest winds during the day. At night, some smoke from smoldering burns in the project area may move down drainages. Piles would be burned under weather conditions that would allow efficient combustion. Table 3-87.

The total treatment acres and emissions displayed have value as a relative comparison of alternatives but not as an assessment of public exposure since the fuel treatments will take place over multiple years and multiple times during each year. Public exposure of smoke emissions will be mitigated by the daily burn day permission and allocation from the California Air Resources Board and the local air pollution control districts. The objective of this program is to mitigate public exposure below health risk thresholds. Most likely the total emissions occurring on any particular burn day may not be allowed to exceed 100 to 200 tons of PM2.5 irrespective of the action alternative. Wildfires Emissions from wildfires within the project area after treatments were modeled. Table 3-90 is based on the First Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM 6.0), the 90th percentile weather for the project area and the estimated fuel loading under each Alternative at year 20 (Boucher 2016). For Alternative 6, the 7,968 acres identified in Alternative 1, 4, and 5 was used for the smoke emission analysis. Alternative 6 generates the maximum emissions compared to all other alternatives. This demonstrates the emissions savings that can be generated from fuels treatments as opposed to wildfire scenarios. Table 3-90.

Table 3-92 shows the GHGs produced from jackpot burning. Table 3-93 sums up the number under those two treatments.

The USFS projects include The Trinity Alps Wilderness Prescribed Fire, Sims Fire Restoration, Mud Springs, Westside Plantation Thin, and South Fuelbreak. Private timberlands burn biomass piles for prepping their land for planting and to remove non-merchantable material on landings. California’s Smoke Management Program (Title 17) is designed to prevent cumulative effects from prescribed fire operations. The program provides allocations of emissions based on the airshed capacity and forecasted dispersal characteristics. The allocation process considers all burn requests, meteorological conditions, forecasted air pollution levels (similar to the BSMPs described by the NRCS 2011) and uncontrollable events like wildfire. Wildfire emissions can overwhelm air basins and most prescribed burn requests are denied during wildfire events. As a result of the California Smoke Management Program and agency oversight, none of the action alternatives are expected to contribute toward significant air quality effects. Alternative 1 (Proposed Action) Direct and Indirect Effects The wildfire emissions for PM2.5 and other pollutants are lower under Alternative 1 as compared to Alternative 2 and 3, but higher than Alternative 4 and 5. The more biomass removed, the less available to burn in a wildfire. The number of acres treated for biomass removal under Alternative 1 are lower (4,072 acres) compared to Alternatives 3 and 2 (7,684 acres and 5,340 acres respectively). Alternative 1 removes more biomass than alternative 4 and 5. The more biomass that can be removed without burning equates to less GHGs being released into the atmosphere. The total GHGs produced are 184,597 CO2 equivalent metric tons from prescribed fire treatments. Cumulative Effects Cumulative Effects would be similar as described under Effects Common to all Alternatives. Alternative 2 Direct and Indirect Effects The wildfire emissions for PM2.5 and other pollutants are lower under Alternative 2 as compared to Alternative 3, but higher than Alternative 1, 4 and 5. The number of acres treated for biomass removal under Alternative 2 are 5,340 acres as compared to 4,072 acres, 7,684, and 782 acres for Alternatives 1, 3 and 4 respectively. Alternative 2 removes more biomass than alternatives 1, 4 and 5. The total GHGs produced are 218,620 CO2 equivalent metric tons from prescribed fire treatments. Cumulative Effects Cumulative Effects would be similar as described under Effects Common to all Alternatives. Alternative 3 Direct and Indirect Effects The highest number of acres being treated for prescribed burning are under Alternative 3 and it produces the highest emissions followed by Alternatives 2 and 1 respectively. The highest benefit in emission reduction compared to a wildfire event would occur under Alternative 3 because maximum biomass would be removed (7,684 acres). The total GHGs produced are 352,127 CO2 equivalent metric tons from prescribed fire treatments. This alternative has the greatest amount of CO2 output because it has the greatest amount of prescribed fire treatments. Cumulative Effects Cumulative effects would be similar as described under Effects Common to all Alternative 4 Direct and Indirect Effects The number of acres treated for biomass removal under Alternative 4 are the lowest (782 acres) compared to 4,072, 5,340 acres and 7,684 acres for Alternatives1, 2, and 3 respectively but higher than alternative 5 which is not removing biomass. The total GHGs produced are 127,456 CO2 equivalent metric tons from prescribed fire treatments. Cumulative Effects Cumulative Effects would be similar as described under Effects Common to all. Alternative 5 Direct and Indirect Effects There are no acres being treated for biomass removal. Pile burning and jackpot burning will occur on 2,769 acres. This alternative treats the smallest amount of acres compared to all other action alternatives. The total GHGs produced are 88,618 CO2 equivalent metric tons from prescribed fire treatments. This alternative has the lowest amount of CO2 output from prescribed fire compared to the other action alternatives, because it has the least amount of fuel reduction treatments; however, wildfires that burn in the future would have the greatest amount of CO2 output compared to the other alternatives, because of the small amount of fuel reduction in this alternative. Cumulative Effects Cumulative Effects would be similar as described under Effects Common to all. Summary of Effects Analysis across All Alternatives Table 3-89 displays total emissions for understory and jackpot burning for each alternative. Total emissions from wildfires were generated using the 90th percentile weather, fuel loading at year 20 and multiplied by the number of acres treated for each alternative except Alternative 6. For Alternative 6, the 7,970 acres identified in Alternatives 1, 4, and 5 were used for the smoke emission analysis. Areas outside treatment units would experience similar fire behavior, which would result in similar emissions. The project is located in an area designated as non-attainment for PM10. PM10 is known to impact human respiratory function and the health and vigor of vegetation and ecosystem health (Grantz et al, 2003). The burn treatments under Alternatives 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 will be conducted under an EPA approved California Smoke Management Program (SMP). Under the revised Conformity Rules the EPA has included a Presumption of Conformity for prescribed fires that are conducted in compliance with a SMP; therefore, the federal actions will be presumed to conform and no separate conformity determination will be made. The California Smoke Management Program provides for the allocation of emissions from biomass burning with respect to cumulative effects. Biomass burning projects are regulated and coordinated by air quality regulatory jurisdictions and all entities submitting burns for approval. In making those decisions, air quality regulators consider forecasts, dispersion conditions, locations of proposed projects and background air quality by air basin. These considerations have historical success in preventing cumulative effects of smoke. Equipment Emissions Estimated logging truck emissions were based upon the assumptions that logging trucks average 1.7 km per liter of fuel (EIA 2009, Mason et al. 2008), and that combustion emissions total 10.52 kg of Carbon/liter of diesel112. Schwaiger and Zimmer (2001) reported a range of payload capacities among European nations; the simulations reported here used an average capacity of 27.2 metric tonnes per logging truck, following survey results from Washington state presented by Mason et al.(2008). It was assumed that one m3 of roundwood weighs 0.9 tonnes (following Schwaiger and Zimmer 2001; similar to the rate of 0.87 t/m3used by Lindholm and Berg 2005), although variation in specific gravity certainly occurs among species. Accordingly, a factor of 0.0143 kg C/m3/km was used to identify fossil carbon emissions related to timber transport. A factor of 150% was added (Lindholm and Berg 2005) to account for empty return trips and loading activities. Thus, the final carbon emission factor used in the simulations below was 0.0214 kg C/m3/km. All transport was assumed to occur via logging trucks. Table 3-94.

The analyses is intended to help interested parties understand the economics between alternatives. In terms of economics, the “best” investment will refer to the purpose and need of capturing economic value through salvage (net present value) and supporting local communities (jobs and wages). Wildfires that kill a large number of trees create an array of economic effects. If the damage is large enough and expands across multiple land ownership, then sale of fire-killed timber can have effects on all market participants (Prestemon et al. 2006). For example, salvage may increase supply so prices fall and 112https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/emission-factors_nov_2015_v2.pdf, accessed  September, 2016. producers of undamaged timber suffer the losses. At the same time, however, the depressed timber prices may benefit consumers of wood products. This economics segment will look at how decaying wood (i.e. deterioration) progressively affects revenue, private sector employment and total annual wages. Net Present Value will be used to determine the best investment in the context of its local community and the benefits of the Forest offering wood products within that community. In addition, this report will also quantify jobs and wages provided by implementing fuels treatment activities outside of salvage units. Past Trends and Existing Conditions Active California primary wood products facilities have decreased from 216 sawmills in 1968 to 28 sawmills in 2016. Concurrently, revenue from lumber sales have decreased (inflation-adjusted) from $5 billion in 1968 to $0.5 billion in 2009. There has been a slow recovery to $0.9 billion in 2012 since the “Great Recession” (McIver et al. 2015) and that positive but slow trend continues to today. Private lands have provided the majority of California’s timber since the 1940s. However, during the 1960s-1980s, as private harvest volumes declined, national forests became an increasingly important source of timber for California’s industry (McIver et al. 2015). Since the late 1980s, both private and national forest harvest have declined with reductions in the harvest from national forests accounting for the majority of the difference. The decline in national forest offerings is largely in part due to social, political, and legal constraints on harvesting (Morgan et al. 2012). Sierra Pacific Industries, Inc. closed its Hayfork facility (Trinity County) in December, 1992, along with 150 jobs of a 2,500 population. To this date Trinity River Lumber Company is the single remaining wood products facility in Trinity County. Nearly 60% of Trinity County’s land base is surrounded by Shasta-Trinity National Forest. That number rises to 75% when including Six Rivers and Mendocino National Forests (Figure 3-23), yet only 18% of the total harvest in Trinity County comes from public lands and timber offerings have been falling since 2007 (Bevington 2013). Figure 3-23 National Forest within Trinity County Methods and Results This section will describe the rates of wood deterioration and its effect on employment and annual wages. It will also describe the type of economic analysis used and rationale behind that choice, the processes used to quantify total volume and value of proposed salvage (revenue) and how fuels treatments (cost) and deterioration effect Net Present Value (NPV). This section will also describe how fuels treatments affect jobs and wages outside of areas identified for salvage treatments. Deterioration Many fire-killed tree species will lose a significant portion of their monetary value and volume for products in a very short time (Lowell et al. 1992, Lowell and Cahill 1996, Sessions et al. 2004), with several factors influencing the rate of deterioration (Lowell et al. 1992). Tree species, tree diameter, bark thickness, percent sapwood, fire severity, season of fire, and local site conditions are just a few of these factors. In addition, it has been recognized that many interactions occur between these factors and different combinations of interaction will result in different rates of deterioration (Cluck and Smith 2007, Ritchie et al. 2013). The cause and effect relationship of these interactions will not be explained here because it is beyond the scope of this document, they have been studied in great detail by other professionals (Lowell et al. 1992, Cluck and Smith 2007, Martinez et al. 2011), and the biological principles of conifer decay haven’t changed. Using relationships from Lowell et al. (1992) and the 2010 Region 5 supplement to the Forest Service Handbook 2409.12 (Ch. 20), the amount of sound wood available for salvage was predicted within five years (Figure 3-24). Smaller diameter trees deteriorate at faster rates than larger diameter trees and approximately half of the deterioration occurs within the first three years. For example, a 10” (diameter at breast height) white fir loses 80% of its monetary value within the first year of being fire-killed but less than 40% if it’s 70” in diameter. Ponderosa pine, however, takes three years to lose a comparable value by equal diameter classes. Douglas-fir and sugar pine generally lose value at slower rates than white fir or ponderosa pine. Rates of decay and loss of monetary value will be the driving variables in this analysis because it 1) affects the viability of selling wood products and 2) affects the workforce harvesting and processing the wood products. Figure 3-24 . Rates of deterioration for four conifer species by 10” diameter classes. Values are from Region 5 supplement to the Forest Service Handbook 2409.12 (ch.20), approved December 16, 2010 Forest Inventory and Pricing Index A total of 96 nested ground-based plots were collected across a random strata of vegetation type, road type, land ownership, slope position and four classes of remotely sensed fire severity data (Rapid Assessment of Vegetation (RAVG), which assess basal area (ft2) loss) within the 2015 wildfires on the Forest. Fixed-and variable-plot radius inventory included species, total height to the nearest foot, diameter at breast height (DBH) to the nearest inch and survival of individual trees. Total acres of salvage was approximated for each alternative113, as follows: • Alternative 1 = 700 acres • Alternative 2 = 950 acres • Alternative 3 = 1,400 acres • Alternative 4 = 110 acres Variables like total trees per acre, basal area (ft2) per acre and quadratic mean diameter were calculated using standard equations common to forestry. Net cubic foot volume was then calculated for individual 113 Note this acreage is less than approximated in Chapter 2 of the EIS. For this report “salvage acres” refers to areas of concentrated stands of dead timber. As this concentration of mortality only occurs in pockets along the roads identified for salvage, and rarely along whole roads (and only dead trees are identified for removal), the smaller subset identified in this report is a more accurate depiction of volume that would be removed by alternative. commercial species ≥ 14” DBH using the Wensel and Olson (1995) tree volume equations (merchantable to 4” top, 1’ stump) and converted to board foot using a standard 0.5 conversion factor. Volume per acre was highly variable across the landscape and distribution of that volume was skewed to the left. As a result, normality was rejected for all tests and median board foot volume per acre was used instead of an average, totaling 20.12 MBF (thousand board feet) before deterioration of fire-killed trees (i.e. as of 2015). The median of 20.12 MBF per acre ranged from 13.17 – 26.44 MBF per acre (95% lower and upper confidence levels, respectively). The median MBF per acre will be multiplied to each alternative that includes X acres of salvage. Using a recent Western Wood Products Summary of price per MBF by species (February 2016), total value of volume per acre was calculated to be approximately $380 per MBF at the mill (Table 3-96). A deduction of $180 per MBF was applied to this “stumpage value” using an average haul and log cost from roadside salvage sales in the area. The result is a net surplus of $200 per MBF per acre as of February, 2016. The value per acre is then multiplied by the number of acres anticipated to be salvaged under each alternative. Annual deterioration of all commercial tree species will be applied proportional to abundance of each species on a per acre basis across alternatives and over time. The price per MBF will stay constant throughout this analysis for comparisons between alternatives. Table 3-96.

(2015) used information from public databases to estimate direct forest industry employment from the harvesting and processing of timber. Employment estimates per unit of timber harvested within that model were referred to as direct response coefficients (DRCs). Employment DRCs can be expressed as number of workers per million board feet (MMBF) of timber harvested and processed on an annual basis. Sorenson et al. (2015) also produced a calculation of wage by DRC using County Business Patterns (2014b) data and the Regional Economic Information System (2014a) wage and salary employment data. Wage DRCs were rounded to the nearest $5,000 and represent annual wages per worker using employment and wage data from calendar year 2011. To illustrate the use of DRCs reported in this Project, the following example of Alternative 1 is provided. A salvage sale of 11.36 MMBF is offered by the U.S. Forest Service in 2016 with the expectation that 90% of the timber will go to a sawmill and 10% will be used to produce energy. The expected annual employment and wages from harvesting and processing of those logs are as follows: • Harvesting the 11.36 MMBF of timber would employ 40.9 workers in forestry and logging, each earning $40,000 per year, for $1.64 million in total annual wages. • Processing the 10.22 MMBF of logs into lumber at the sawmill would employ 30.7 workers, each earning $45,000 per year, for $1.38 million in total annual wages. • The use of the sawmill residue at other facilities would employ an additional 6.1 workers, each earning $55,000 per year, for $0.34 million in total annual wages. • The use of wood chips to produce energy would employ 2.7 workers, each earning $45,000 per year, for $0.12 million in total annual wages. Thus, the total direct private sector employment from harvesting and processing 11.36 MMBF of logs in Trinity County, based on the assumed product use, would be 80.4 workers for a year (2016), with total annual wages of approximately $3,480,000 in 2011 dollars (Table 3-97). As time progresses and wood continues to deteriorate (MMBF), the monetary worth (REVENUE) declines along with the private sector of employment (JOBS) and total annual wages (WAGES). The complete breakdown of jobs and wages by alternatives over time, including 2015, is located in Appendix A of the economics report. Table 3-97, Direct response coefficients (DRCs) applicable to alternatives with salvage within the Project. Alternative 1  Year 2016  Year 2017  Year 2018  Year 2019  MMBF  11.36  5.43  3.12  2.05  REVENUE  $2,271,612  $1,086,610  $624,323  $410,809  JOBS  80.4  38.4  22.1  14.5  WAGES  $3,475,548  $1,661,580  $954,720  $627,300  Alternative 2  --------------------- ----------------------- ----------------------- ---- MMBF  15.41  7.37  4.24  2.79  REVENUE  $3,082,902  $1,474,685  $847,296  $557,527  JOBS  109.1  52.2  30.0  19.8  WAGES  $4,716,837  $2,255,220  $1,297,440  $853,740  Alternative 3  --------------------- ----------------------- ----------------------- ---- MMBF  22.72  10.87  6.24  4.11  REVENUE  $4,543,224  $2,173,220  $1,248,646  $821,618  JOBS  160.8  77.0  44.2  29.1  WAGES  $6,951,127  $3,326,220  $1,909,440  $1,257,660  Alternative 4  --------------------- ----------------------- ----------------------- ---- MMBF  1.78  0.85  0.49  0.32  REVENUE  $356,968  $170,753  $98,108  $64,556  JOBS  12.6  6.0  3.5  2.3  WAGES  $546,149  $261,263  $150,093  $98,777  Approximately 80.4 jobs are created within the private sector for one year every 5 million board feet (MMBF) harvested and processed. As time progresses, fire-killed trees deteriorate creating less volume for harvesting, processing and associated jobs. Revenue is the projected value from salvage only and does not include the cost of fuels treatment (except those generated by salvage activities such as slash). Jobs and Wages -Fuels Treatments (outside of salvage)Salvage is an opportunity to capture economic value before the natural resource deteriorates beyond its monetary worth. However, salvage is only economically viable in areas with higher concentrations of merchantable conifers. There are many other stand conditions across this project area that would not support economically viable treatment of fuels. These include low severity burns with small pockets of moderate severity, stands composed primarily of younger trees, stands with high hardwood or brush components, etc. These “other conditions” also pose a hazard to users of National Forest System roads due to potential hazard tree failures as well as high fuel loading. Under this project, fuels will be treated to between 10-20 tons/acre depending on area and conditions. Fuels work will be accomplished both by force account (utilizing Forest Service employees), through agreements with partners, and through the award of service contracts. Work includes falling hazard trees and treatment of fuels. Treatment of fuels will most commonly be accomplished by mastication or hand/machine-piling and burning. Sorenson et al. (2015) has a section for roundwood processing within California and Nevada. Those DRC values were used to quantify total number of workers per MMBF (million board feet), which converts to approximately 1.8 jobs per year. The type of worker and annual wage is highly variable because they could be from different contractors or under force account within the Forest Service. As such, it is estimated that an average annual wage would be approximately $30,000 per worker. Using the volume estimates within the Forest Inventory and Pricing Index section, 20.12 MBF (thousand board feet) is estimated on a per acre basis. The Fuels report shows more acres of treatment for each Alternative than acres of salvage. Areas identified for salvage are accounted for above, however jobs resulting from treating fuels outside salvage units was calculated utilizing a factor of 0.3 applied to Alternatives 1-3, and 0.5 applied to Alternatives 4 and 5 due to low volume estimate because 1) not all areas will have more than 10-20 tons per acre, and 2) non-commercial species like small diameter conifers and hardwoods have less mass (or weight) than commercial species. A DRC of 1.8 will be multiplied by 0.02 MMBF per acre. Therefore, 0.018 is the constant DRC to be multiplied by the total acres of fuels treatments (outside of salvage), by Alternative. Table 3-98.

Unfortunately, costs and benefits are not always tangible or can be expressed in monetary terms, thereby limiting the usefulness of a CBA (Knowler and Lovett 1996, Prestemon et al. 2006, Salverda and Hawkins 2003). Benefits are usually more difficult to assess than costs. This leads to difficulties in establishing the worth of “unpriced values” such as scenery, clean air, clean water, genetic diversity, ecosystem function, habitat quality and quantity, etc. Economists agree that these unpriced values have worth, however, their monetary value is difficult or impossible to establish (Salverda and Hawkins 2003), and these values are very open to personal interpretation (Silva 1996). Timber salvage activities by private landowners can generally be predicted (e.g. mill value minus logging costs). Optimal salvage harvest from public lands, however, are more difficult to predict because the objective function is heavily influenced by competing interest groups and a body of natural resource law (Prestemon et al. 2006). Public forests are managed for a complex of competing objectives that go far beyond timber economics. For all the reasons stated above, net present value (NPV) will be used to compare the costs of each alternative and the effectiveness of each alternative in the Project. Net present value is the present value of cash generated by a project less the initial investment on the project. It is one of the most reliable measures used in capital budgeting because it accounts for time value of money by using discounted cash inflows. If the NPV of a proposed project is positive, it would 114 A factor of 0.3 was applied to the volume estimations for alternatives 1-3 as it is assumed less fuel exists outside areas identified for salvage, and 0.5 was applied to volume estimates in Alternatives 4 and 5 to account for the higher quantities of fuel in project area in the absence or near absence of salvage removal generally be accepted. However, if NPV is negative, the project would probably be rejected because cash flows will also be negative. The formula for NPV is as follows: ∞ 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡−𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 = l p (1 + 𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖)𝑡𝑡 𝑡𝑡=0 Where, t = time in years ri = discount rate at t Before calculating NPV, a target rate of return is typically set to discount the net cash inflows from a project to ensure some level of profit. The target rate of return for salvage units, however, is to “break even” so the target rate of return will be greater than or equal to zero. As such, if net cash inflow (revenue) is equal to or greater than total cash inflow during a period less the expenses (cost), then the project is considered economically viable and generally excepted. If, in contrast, an alternative costs more than the revenue generated, then the project is not considered economically viable and generally not excepted. Revenue will be cash inflow generated from the commercial sale of fire-killed trees (i.e. salvage) and cost will be the expense from fuels treatments within salvage units. The analysis for this project will look at NPV of a single investment and compare the monetary worth of such an investment between alternatives over time. NPV is only calculated for the alternatives that include salvage (Alternatives 1-4). Every calculation of NPV over time will have salvage in year X and fuels treatment 1 year after salvage. The discount rate for time (t) is 4% per year. Deterioration begins immediately after a tree was killed. But for the purpose of this project, rates of deteriorations were calculated after the wildfires were considered “contained.” That occurred, roughly, in September-October of 2015. This is where time equals zero when calculating NPV. Figure 3-25 (and corresponding table, below) illustrates NPV of a single investment if made at 4 successive years after the 2015 wildfires. Again, it only shows the alternatives that includes salvage. Weighted average of wood decay rates by successive years are 19.3% (2016), 61.4% (2017), 77.8% (2018) and 85.4% (2019) for an average breast height diameter of all species at 25”. It’s expected that the Project will see a surplus of $646,957 in Alternative 1 if the investment is made within the 2016 calendar year. However, due to deterioration, it’s expected that the Project will be deficit -$476,527 if the investment is made within the 2017 calendar year. The pattern of lost revenue continues through succeeding years for all alternatives, but it’s the difference between 2016 and 2017 that is noteworthy for this project. Fuels treatments (cost) will be greater than salvage (revenue) at approximately 1.6 years after the 2015 wildfires for all alternatives including salvage units. Treatment of activity generated fuels from salvage treatments were calculated using averaged bids for National Forest’s “Hazardous Fuels Reduction Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity” (HFR IDIQ) Contracts in northern California. Fuels treatments specific to this project were then summed over the entire treatment area for a total of approximately $1,906,235 for Alternative 1 (2017 cost at present value), $2,587,033 for Alternative 2 (2017 cost at present value), $3,812,469 for Alternative 3 (2017 cost at present value) and $299,552 for Alternative 4 (2017 cost at present value). This appraised value of service also considered safety and insurance liability of working in hazardous conditions, long commute to work sites, and distance between work sites. Each cost is based on 2015 estimated volumes per alternative and a discount rate of 8% (2 years post fire times 4%). Figure 3-25 Revenue from salvage over time and across alternatives not including the cost of fuels treatment (line graph). Table 3-99.

The other two purpose and needs are near impossible to quantify through a monetary lens as described earlier about the worth of “unpriced values” (see Economic Analysis section). As such, the economic consequence will be defined by number of jobs, annual wages and how rates of deterioration effect employment, annual wages and ability to capture economic value. Alternative 1 (Proposed Action) Direct and Indirect Effect Salvage Approximately 11.36 MMBF of publically-owned wood worth $2,271,612 would be sold in year 2016, harvested, brought to a local mill and processed in the domestic marketplace. A little over 80 private sector jobs would be sustained for one year, totaling $3,475,548 in annual wages. This alternative provides about 26% fewer private sector jobs and wages than alternative 2, 50% fewer private sector jobs and wages than alternative 3 and over six times more private sector jobs and wages than alternative 4. No private sector jobs and wages relating to salvage are provided in alternatives 5 and 6 for comparison. Since the treatment of fuels is not subject to wood deterioration, that treatment will be constant at 2015 board feet volume (14.08 MMBF) for a total cost of $1,906,235. If delayed until 2017 or beyond, revenue from depreciated wood will have passed the point it can pay for fuels treatments and NPV will be less than zero (2017 NPV = -$476,527). There is also a likelihood the Project will be rejected because it no longer has economic viability, this is also true with alternatives 2, 3, and 4. This concept is also true for the private sector in alternatives 1-4. There is the chance of not receiving bids on the salvage sale(s) because the mill has their own bottom line that includes a target rate of return where NPV must be greater than zero. The salvage sales need to be offered in a timely manner or else there is a chance no mill can afford to harvest and process the material (American Forest Resource Council meeting with the Forest, May of 2015). Generally speaking, the depreciation of wood needs to be less than 3040% for economic viability of operations (Trinity River Lumber Company, personal communication). Fuels Treatments (Outside Salvage) No economic value will be captured and approximately 44 MMBF of fuels will be treated in various ways as described in the Fuels Report. Total cost of those treatments across over 7,200 acres is approximately $9,957,100. It has also been estimated to take about 1225 days to achieve, totaling 264 jobs and $7,916,100 in wages. This alternative 1 provides about 27% fewer jobs and wages than alternative 2, 72% fewer jobs and wages than alternative 3, 21% fewer jobs and wages than alternatives 4, and 25% more than alternative 5. No private sector jobs and wages would be provided under Alternative 6. Cumulative Effects Past, present and future actions add up to be approximately 42,300 acres. Assuming 20.12 MBF per acre (see Forest Inventory and Pricing Index section of the Economics Report), a total of 851 MMBF have been, is, and will be cut by 2020. Removing areas already cut (past) from that total, the sum of present and future actions is roughly 19,300 acres for a total of 388 MMBF harvested and processed up to 2020. Trinity River Lumber Company currently averages 160-175 MMBF per year and needs at least 75-80 MMBF per year to sustain operations. Present and future actions from both U.S. Forest Service and the private sector is predicted to supply just under 80 MMBF per year until 2020; the minimum the mill needs to stay in business. Past actions in the County of impact have led to a reduction in infrastructure capable of harvesting and processing trees into lumber. Of the roughly 2 million acres within Trinity County, 18,230 acres had harvest from the private sector and 4,765 acres had harvest from the Shasta-Trinity National Forest since 2005. This accounts for approximately 82% from the Private sector and 18% from the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Collectively, that’s only 1% of lands harvested in Trinity County within the last 10 years for a total of about 23,000 acres in past actions. This equates to approximately 3,271 jobs and $141,412,160 wages in the private sector, assuming 462 MMBF in the last 10 years. Most of the private sector has already begun or completed fire salvage operations authorized under a notice of emergency timber operations (Public Resources Code §4592 and Title 14 California Code of Regulations §1052-1052.3). Therefore, present actions contributing to cumulative effects include an estimated emergency fire salvage of 2,425 acres and an additional 418 acres of harvest on unburned forest with the Private sector of Trinity County. The U.S. Forest Service has 4 thinning projects and multiple deck sales for a total of 2,372 additional acres. The sum of both private and U.S. Forest Service present actions is about 4,800 acres. This equates to approximately 687 jobs and $29,690,430 wages in the private sector, assuming 97 MMBF. Foreseeable future actions include 12,415 acres of various cutting methods proposed on private lands since 2005, but not yet harvested. The U.S. Forest Service has the proposal to salvage 700 acres of roadside hazards within this project, another 189 acres of hazard trees near power lines and 2 thinning projects for 1,200 acres. The sum of both private and U.S. Forest Service future actions is about 14,500 acres. This equates to approximately 2,068 jobs and $89,377,385 wages in the private sector, assuming 292 MMBF within the next 5 years (2020). Alternative 2 Direct and Indirect Effects Salvage Approximately 15.41 MMBF of publically-owned wood worth $3,082,900 will be sold, harvested, brought to a local mill and processed in the domestic marketplace. A little over 109 private sector jobs would be sustained for one year, totaling $4,716,840 in annual wages. This alternative provides about 26% more private sector jobs and wages than alternative 1, 32% fewer private sector jobs and wages than alternative 3 and over eight times more private sector jobs and wages than alternative 4. No private sector jobs and wages relating to salvage are provided in alternatives 5 and 6 for comparison. Since the treatment of fuels is not subject to wood deterioration, that treatment will be constant at 2015 board feet volume (19.11 MMBF) for a total cost of $2,587,033. If delayed until 2017 or beyond, revenue from depreciated wood will have passed the point it can pay for fuels treatments and NPV will be less than zero (2017 NPV = -$642,644). There is also a likelihood the Project will be rejected because it no longer has economic viability. Fuels Treatments (Outside Salvage) No economic value will be captured and approximately 51 MMBF of fuels will be treated in various ways as described in the Fuels Report. Total cost of those treatments across 8,572 acres is approximately $11,809,700. It has also been estimated to take about 1429 days to achieve, totaling 362 jobs and $10,873,400 in wages. This alternative 2 provides about 1.4 times the jobs and wages than alternative 1, 62% fewer jobs and wages than alternative 3, 1.1 times the jobs and wages than alternatives 4, and 1.7 times the jobs and wages provided in Alternative 5. Cumulative Effects Past and present actions are the same in this Alternative (2) as in Alternative 1. However, Alternative 2 has an additional 250 acres of proposed salvage for a total of 950 acres in the foreseeable future. As a result, the sum of both private and U.S. Forest Service future actions is about 14,750 acres. This equates to 2,103 jobs and $90,907,820 wages in the private sector, assuming 297 MMBF within the next 5 years (2020). In other words, it’s 35 more jobs and $1,530,435 more wages in the private sector than Alternative 1. Alternative 3 Direct and Indirect Effects Salvage Approximately 22.72 MMBF of publically-owned wood worth $4,543,224 will be sold, harvested, brought to a local mill and processed in the domestic marketplace. A little over 160 private sector jobs would be sustained for one year, totaling $6,951,127 in annual wages. This alternative provides about 50% more private sector jobs and wages than alternative 1, 32% more private sector jobs and wages than alternative 2 and over twelve times more jobs and wages than alternative 4. No private sector jobs and wages are provided in alternatives 5 and 6 for comparison. Since the treatment of fuels is not subject to wood deterioration, that treatment will be constant at 2015 board feet volume (28.17 MMBF) for a total cost of $3,812,469. If delayed until 2017 or beyond, revenue from depreciated wood will have passed the point it can pay for fuels treatments and NPV will be less than zero (2017 NPV = -$947,094). There is also a likelihood the Project will be rejected because it no longer has economic viability. Fuels Treatments (Outside Salvage) No economic value will be captured and approximately 83 MMBF of fuels will be treated in various ways as described in the Fuels Report. Total cost of those treatments across 13,766 acres is approximately $18,897,800. It has also been estimated to take about 2313 days to achieve, totaling 942 jobs and $28,268,200 in wages. This alternative 3 provides about 3.6 times the jobs and wages than alternative 1, 2.6times the jobs and wages of alternative 2, 2.8 times the jobs and wages for alternatives 4, and 4.5 time the jobs and wages of Alternative 5. Cumulative Effects Past and present actions are the same in this Alternative (3) as in Alternative 1. However, Alternative 3 has an additional 700 acres of proposed salvage for a total of 1,400 acres in the foreseeable future. Resultantly, the sum of both private and U.S. Forest Service future actions is about 15,200 acres. This equates to 2,167 jobs and $93,662,600 wages in the private sector, assuming 306 MMBF within the next 5 years (2020). In other words, it’s 99 more jobs and $4,325,215 more wages in the private sector than Alternative 1. Alternative 4 Direct and Indirect Effects Salvage Approximately 1.78 MMBF of publically-owned wood worth $356,968 will be sold, harvested, brought to a local mill and processed in the domestic marketplace. Over 12 private sector jobs would be sustained for one year, totaling $546,149 in annual wages. This alternative provides about six times fewer private sector jobs and wages than alternative 1, about 8 times fewer private sector jobs and wages than alternative 2 and just over 12 times fewer jobs and wages than alternative 3. No private sector jobs and wages are provided in alternatives 5 and 6 for comparison. Since the treatment of fuels is not subject to wood deterioration, that treatment will be constant at 2015 board feet volume (2.21 MMBF) for a total cost of $299,552. If delayed until 2017 or beyond, revenue from depreciated wood will have passed the point it can pay for fuels treatments and NPV will be less than zero (2017 NPV = -$130,159). There is a chance the Project will be rejected because it no longer has economic viability. Fuels Treatments (Outside Salvage) No economic value will be captured and approximately 57 MMBF of fuels will be treated in various ways as described in the Fuels Report. Total cost of those treatments across 5,731 acres is approximately $7,110,200. It has also been estimated to take about 1176 days to achieve, totaling 332 jobs and $9,971,000 in wages. This alternative 4 provides about 1.3 times the jobs and wages than alternative 1, 8% fewer jobs and wages than alternative 2, 65% fewer jobs and wages than alternative 3, and approximately 1.6 times the jobs and wages of alternative 5. Cumulative Effects Past and present actions are the same in this Alternative (4) as in Alternative 1. However, Alternative 4 has 590 fewer acres of proposed salvage for a total of 110 acres in the foreseeable future. Resultantly, the sum of both private and U.S. Forest Service future actions is about 13,910 acres. This equates to 1,983 jobs and $85,704,340 wages in the private sector, assuming 280 MMBF within the next 5 years (2020). In other words, its 85 fewer jobs and $3,673,045 fewer wages in the private sector than Alternative 1. Alternative 5 Direct and Indirect Effects This alternative does not generate any revenue from proposed treatments. The costs of all fuels treatments is estimated to be approximately $10,517,200. The cost of fuels treatments would not be offset by any volume removed from a salvage timber sale. However, the just over 4,000 acres of fuels treatments are expected to take 2.9 years to achieve, totaling 212 jobs and $6,352,100 in wages. This alternative 5 provides about 20% fewer jobs and wages than alternative 1, 42% fewer jobs and wages than alternative 2, 78% fewer jobs and wages than alternative 3, and approximately 36% fewer jobs and wages as alternative 4. No private sector jobs and wages associated with the harvesting and processing of wood would be supported. That’s a total of just over 80 jobs for $3,475,548 in annual wages compared with Alternative 1. Some of the activities will be done by U.S. Forest Service fire and fuels personnel, but the proportion of that work depends on available outyear funding and competing priorities, including fire suppression needs. Timber industry, including the last remaining sawmill in Trinity County would benefit from more wood coming off U.S. Forest Service lands, but this Alternative would not contribute to that benefit. The $3.47 million in annual wages from Alternative 1 would not go back to the community through retail, food services, manufacturing, wholesalers, etc. The Project will not send any wood to the mill for processing, thereby reducing the contributed volume from U.S. Forest Service lands and increasing the pressure from private sector lands to make up that difference. Cumulative Effects No harvest or processing under this project would place Trinity County below the State average of U.S. Forest Service offerings, from 18% with Alternative 1 to less than 16%. A trend that may also be exacerbated by wildfires and the exorbitant taxpayer cost associated with suppression activities. For example, 568,600 acres have burned at mixed severities since 2005 in Trinity County alone for an average cost approaching $1,000 per acre. What used to cost millions of dollars in recent years past is now costing billions of dollars today. It’s having a significant effect on other U.S. Forest Service programs like vegetation management, thereby reducing the probability of getting ahead of the issue by thinning forests before wildfires and contributing a larger proportion of wood to the sawmill (Figure 3-26). The more fires are fought, the less wood will go to mills. Figure 3-26: The cost of wildland fire as a percentage of the Forest Service’s annual budget (USDA 2015). Alternative 6 – No Action Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects The U.S. Forest Service has been encouraged to provide opportunities that support local businesses in rural communities like Trinity County. The no-action alternative will not support the local communities of Trinity County. Rather, jeopardize human health and safety of those community members. Roads will continue to be open, visitors and U.S. Forest Service personnel will have to access their lands at their own risk. All of the standing hazards (fire-killed trees along roads) will eventually fall down and slowly decay, with many of the trees striking the road. Those trees that do not strike the road will accumulate and create a hazardous condition during the next wildfire. Fire fighters will not be able to quickly respond to the next incident and protect the threatened communities. This is because fire behavior will be too severe and unsafe to enter or exit along roads blocked by downed trees or under intense fire conditions. Loss of human life (greatest cost), Tort Claims on the U.S. Forest Service (costly and unpredictable), increased intensity during the next wildfire (i.e. decreased success of wildfire suppression tactics) are possible adverse effects if no action is taken to make roads safe. The local communities will not be supported. Economic Impacts of Decision TimingAn additional point to be considered is the effect of deterioration on timber yields. If a second year is to pass before implementation of the project, the value of timber will have dropped below the cost for activity generated fuels treatment (Figure 3-25). The salvage and fuels treatment investments in 2016 is worth from $43,687 -$1,293,914, depending on the selected alternative with salvage. However, if the investment is made in 2017, then the investments worth becomes negative, ranging from -$130,159 to $642,644, depending on the selected alternative with salvage. The trees are losing their monetary value rapidly and it’s just a matter of time before any investment will no longer be economically viable. If the Project is not viable and cannot be sold, then jobs and wages of harvesting and processing wood products are effected. Any investment in fuels treatments contribute to supporting jobs and wages in the local community. Archeology/Heritage _________________________ Introduction The Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage project (Project) is a Section 106 action, and as such an archaeological survey was carried out for the project area. The fire complexes being addressed in this undertaking are located on the South Fork Management Unit and Trinity River Management Unit of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest (Forest). A total of 18 sites lay within the Area of Potential Effect (APE) for this project. Seven sites were severely affected by high intensity fire and two sites were impacted by suppression work. To ensure the previously recorded sites will be protected, management measures stipulated under the Programmatic Agreement among the U.S.D.A Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Region (Region 5), California State Historic Preservation Officer, Nevada State Historic Preservation Officer, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation Regarding the Processes for Compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act for Management of Historic Properties by the National Forests of the Pacific Southwest Region (Programmatic Agreement) 2012 shall be adhered to. Proposed Actions and Alternatives AnalyzedSee chapter 2 of the project Environmental Impact Statement for a full description of the project alternatives. Methodology Detailed MethodologyArchaeological survey methodology followed the procedures in APPENDIX H, REGION 5 HAZARDOUS FUELS PROTOCOL for NON-INTENSIVE INVENTORY STRATEGIES FOR HAZARDOUS FUELS AND VEGETATION REDUCTION PROJECTS of the Programmatic Agreement. These procedures correspond to a methodology followed for this Forest based on a predictive model of site locations developed for the Shasta-Trinity National Forest by Theodoratus in 1981. This model assumes that human habitation sites are going to be more likely on slopes of 0-15 percent. Level ground is easier to camp and live on then steep ground. In this model Slopes between 0-15 percent are considered areas of high sensitivity, 16-30 percent slopes are considered moderated and slopes greater than 30 percent are considered low zones of archaeological sensitivity. The inventory strategy employed is expected to be sufficient in identifying all historic properties that may be affected in the proposed project’s APE (Theodoratus 1981). Reconnaissance survey of low sensitivity areas allowed for field verification of slope and other sensitivity factors. All high zones of archaeological sensitivity within the survey units, such as ridge tops, streams, terraces, saddles, and benches were inventoried. Inventory was conducted along road margins and within the 300-foot buffer on either side of the 233 miles of roads identified in the Project. No inventory was conducted outside of the designated survey units. In addition to the salvage work, roads identified in the Sediment Source Inventory (SSI) needing mitigation of erosion problems were examined. This work is needed to allow the Forest to obtain a Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements for Nonpoint Source Discharges Related to Certain Federal Land Management Activities on NFS Lands in the North Coast Region (“Waiver”). Inventory was conducted as follows: • Intensive inventory strategy was employed whenever the slope was 30 percent or less within a designated survey unit. Actual salvage logging and fuel reduction units were prioritized. Three crew members were utilized for a majority of the survey work. Crewmembers were spaced no more than 30 meters apart, beginning at the centerline of the road and lined up outwards into the road side buffer. Transects were completed for a selected distance, and then reversed until the entire survey unit was covered. Both sides of the road side buffers were inventoried in this manner. All ridge tops, flats, streams, terraces, saddles, and benches were inventoried within survey units. • Reconnaissance inventory strategy was employed where the slope was greater than 30 percent within a designated survey unit. This inventory strategy was considered acceptable for these areas due to safety concerns as well as low sensitivity for the presence of cultural resources. Areas were spot-checked to verify assumed conditions of steep terrain. Binoculars were utilized if deemed necessary to locate features such as structures, rock art, or small flat areas, or other high zones of archaeological sensitivity. Analysis Indicators The affected resource area is called the Area of Potential Effect (APE). For Heritage resource management analysis the APE is essentially the proposed project actions and area these actions will take place within (treatment units). The APE has a total of 18 archaeological sites adjacent or within units planned for salvage and fuel treatment. Indicators for cultural resource management is the presence or absence of archaeological resources within the project area that could be adversely effected by the proposed action. Recorded archaeological resource sites will have management measures stipulated in the Programmatic Agreement applied to avoid any adverse impacts from salvage or fuel treatment actions. These measures are from Appendix E of the Programmatic Agreement, Standard Resource Protection Measures 1.0 Class I, and are as follows: • All historic properties shall be clearly delineated prior to implementing any associated activities that have the potential to affect historic properties. Historic property boundaries shall be delineated with coded flagging and/or other effective marking. • If mechanical equipment is used in treatment buffers, all recorded cultural and archaeological resources will be flagged and avoided following the site protective guidelines in the Region 5 Section 106 Programmatic Agreement. However, vegetation within these sites can be removed using tools such as hand tools, a grapple, or a rubber tired skidder so long as ground disturbance is minimized and features avoided. Treatments within individual cultural and archeological sites must be approved and monitored by a Forest Service archeologist. • Woody material may be chipped within the boundaries of historic properties so long as the staging of chipping equipment on-site does not affect historic properties and staging areas are specifically approved by HPMs or qualified Heritage Program staff. • Monitoring by heritage program specialists may be used to enhance the effectiveness of protection measures. • The recorded historic properties will be noted in the contract as controlled areas to be avoided. Contract administrators will insure these protective measures are followed. • If new cultural resources are discovered, all work in the vicinity will cease until qualified Heritage Program staff examines and assesses the resource. Appropriate measures will be undertaken to protect the new resource prior to activities resuming. Spatial and Temporal Bounding of Analysis AreaThe spatial bounding of the analysis area for Heritage is the proposed salvage and fuel treatment areas. It is within this project area that the archaeological pre-field research and survey work focused. The temporal bounding for effects to identified cultural resource sites are divided into short term and long term. The short term effects would occur within one to two years during implementation of the proposed action. Long term effects would occur up to 10 years after implementation is completed and may include looting damage (due to soil surface visibility), until vegetation recovers. Affected environment The APE has a total of 18 archaeological sites adjacent or within units planned for salvage and fuel treatment. Of this total 17 were previously recorded and one new site recorded. Seven sites were severely impacted by high intensity fire on South Fork Mountain. The fires in this area burned at a high intensity consuming all the live vegetation along with the heavy accumulation of fuels. This fuel loading maintained a high heat over an extended period of time. This caused expansion of microscopic water in the chert material resulting in spalling and shattering. Environmental Consequences Alternative 1 (Proposed Action) and Alternative 2 The proposed hazard reduction, salvage, and road erosion mitigation for “North Coast Region Waiver” actions will have no adverse effect to recorded archaeological sites because of the inclusion of the resource protection measures (RPMs) number 72-77. Alternative 2 even though it has more project acres will not affect any additional recorded archaeological sites. Direct and Indirect Effects The RPMs for Cultural Resources will prevent any direct effects from the Alternatives 1 and 2. However, indirect adverse effects may occur because the proposed salvage and fuel treatments may open up the vegetation covering these sites within the APE, making them more vulnerable to looting. No known archaeological sites will be affected by the connected actions. Cumulative Effects This project could have cumulative effects on cultural resources in the next ten years when combined with the 2015 wildfires. Both the fires and the project open up ground visibility by removing vegetation, which may make the cultural sites vulnerable to looting. Once vegetation is reestablished this cumulative effect will be mitigated. The 2015 wildfires had direct negative impacts on cultural sites in the form of damage from high temperatures; however, implementing the RPMs, and avoiding cultural sites, will prevent this project from having direct impacts and thus prevents further cumulative impact on sites. Past effects to these sites was logging and recreation use.  By following the RPMs there should be no current or future cumulative effects. Alternative – 3 This alternative has the most proposed project acres; however, no additional sites will be impacted from this alternative as determined from prefield research and survey work. The RPMs to be followed in Alternative 1 and 2 will be adequate for Alternative 3. These measures will prevent, as in Alternatives 1 and 2, any direct adverse effects to recorded archaeological sites within the APE. Indirect adverse effects may occur because the proposed salvage and fuel treatments may open up the vegetation covering these sites within the APE, making them more vulnerable to looting. As in Alternatives 1 and 2 there have been past effects from logging and recreation.  Present and future cumulative will not occur due to the fact that RPMs are in place. Alternatives -4-5 The salvage and fuels reduction proposed under Alternative 4 and the fuels reduction proposed under Alternative 5 will not occur within the one newly recorded site or the previously recorded sites; therefore, these activities will have no direct effects. No RPMs will be necessary even with salvage and fuels reduction proposed under this alternative. However, the falling and leaving of hazardous dead trees and vegetation on archaeological sites adds large (3 inch diameter or greater) thousand hour fuels. These fuels have the potential to adversely affect lithic and organic cultural materials due to the high temperature of combustion in the event of a future wildfire. Although dead trees could be directionally fell away from these sites, many still have numerous dead trees within their boundaries. Dead trees felled within sites will add to the untreated fuels already there. This will result in greater potential of adverse thermal indirect effects. There have been past cumulative effects from logging and recreation. If there are heavy fuels left on sites from hazard tree falling there will be current and future cumulative effects that could adversely damage these archaeological sites. Alternative 6 – No Action Direct Effects and Indirect Effects There will be no direct effects under the no action alternative. Indirect effects will be caused by untreated fuel accumulation on recorded sites. Future wildland fires burning through these sites because of heavy fuel loadings will cause thermal damage to chert and obsidian artifacts. Any organic cultural material will be burned away. Cumulative Effects Under this alternative we will have no cumulative effects on cultural resources in the next ten years. As stated in the cumulative effects statement for alternative 1 and 2, removal of vegetation does provide better surface visibility. However, since there are no effects to sites under this alternative there will be no cumulative effects. Summary of EffectsAlternatives 1 and 2 will have the potential to effect 18 recorded archaeological sites. The increased number of acres under Alternative 3 would not affect any additional archaeological site. This additional acreage was checked for previously recorded sites but none were noted within this added area.  Survey work done for the project did not reveal any new sites within this added acreage. Impacts of Alternatives 1-3 would be reduced to zero with implementation of the RPMs. Alternatives 4 and 5 with their reduced salvage acreage would not have treatments that occur within archeological sites, they too would have no effect to recorded archaeological sites. Dead trees and vegetation that will be felled within a 300-foot wide buffer on NFS lands along 233 miles of roads open to the public that burned during the 2015 will have no immediate effect. However, if Alternatives 4 or 5 are chosen, the falling of dead trees and vegetation within sites will add to the untreated fuels already there. This will result in greater potential of adverse thermal effects from wildland fire in the future. Compliance with law, regulation, policy, and the Forest Plan All historic sites within the APE will be protected and managed under the Programmatic Agreement. Compliance with the Programmatic Agreement’s management stipulations for protecting and managing heritage resources will meet the Forest’s Section 106 compliance obligations under the National Historic Preservation Act for this undertaking. At the end of each calendar year a report is generated by the Heritage staff listing various projects covered under the Programmatic Agreement for that year. This report is sent to the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and to the Regional Office for review. SHPO reviews this report to determine how well the Forest is meeting the guidelines set in the Programmatic Agreement. This annual report is part of the compliance process with SHPO in meeting the Forest’s Section 106 obligations under the National Historic Preservation Act. Inventoried Roadless Areas ___________________ Introduction This section will analyze the effects of each alternative on Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs) within the project area. Alternatives 1-5 would result in treatments within IRA boundaries. Many of the acres proposed for treatment are the outer edges of buffers originating from roads outside, but adjacent to the IRAs. However, there are some roads proposed for treatment within the IRA boundaries as well. Treatments have the potential to impact the Bell Quinby, Chanchelulla, Cow Creek, Little French Creek, Pattision and Salt Gulch IRAs. The 2001 roadless rule identifies nine characteristics that are common to most inventoried roadless areas. These will serve as the criteria by which treatments will be evaluated. Regulatory FrameworkFor the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, the RARE II study identified 48 areas as roadless study areas subject to evaluation for potential wilderness designation. Some of these areas were designated as wilderness in the Wilderness Act of 1964 and the California Wilderness Act of 1984. Inventoried roadless areas are identified in the Shasta-Trinity Land and Resource Management Plan. Additionally, the 1984 California Wilderness Act released 29 inventoried RARE II roadless areas, to be managed for multiple-uses other than wilderness (from Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan, p. 3-24). These included Backbone, Bell-Quimby, Bonanza King, Castle Crags, Chanchelulla, China Springs, Chinquapin, Cow Creek, Devils Rock, Dog Creek, Eagle: East Beegum, East Fork, East Girard, Fisher Gulch, Kettle Mountain, Little French Creek, Mt. Shasta, Murphy Glade, Panther, Pattison, Penner Ridge, Salt Gulch, Slate Creek, South Fork, Underwood, Wells Mountain, West Beegum, and West Girard (from Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Appendix C). They are managed in accordance to the 2001 Roadless Rule. In 2001, the Roadless Area Conservation Rule (36 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 294, Special Areas) was adopted which changed how the Forest Service managed the inventoried roadless areas by establishing nationwide prohibitions which generally limited, with some exceptions, timber harvest, road construction, and road reconstruction within the areas because these activities “…have the greatest likelihood of altering and fragmenting landscapes, resulting in immediate, long-term loss of roadless area values and characteristics. Inventoried roadless areas provide clean drinking water and function as biological strongholds for populations of threatened and endangered species. They provide large, relatively undisturbed landscapes that are important to biological diversity and the long-term survival of many at risk species. Inventoried roadless areas provide opportunities for dispersed outdoor recreation, opportunities that diminish as open space and natural settings are developed elsewhere. They also serve as bulwarks against the spread of non-native invasive plant species and provide reference areas for study and research”. [Roadless Rule, 2001] These nationally applied prohibitions superseded the land management plan prescriptions for inventoried roadless areas.” Methodology The 2001 Roadless Rule identifies nine values or features that often characterize inventoried roadless areas. They are: high quality or undisturbed soil, water, and air; sources of public drinking water; diversity of plant and animal communities; habitat for threatened, endangered, proposed, candidate, and sensitive species and for those species dependent on large, undisturbed areas of land; primitive, semi-primitive non-motorized, and semi-primitive motorized classes of dispersed recreation; reference landscapes; natural appearing landscapes with high scenic quality; traditional cultural properties and sacred sites; and other locally identified unique characteristics. Descriptions for each of these characteristics is provided in Table 3-100. Table 3-100: Descriptions of the nine roadless area characteristics (Federal Register, 2001). Roadless Characteristics  Roadless Character Descriptions (66 Fed. Reg. 3245 (Jan. 12 2001))  High Quality or Undisturbed Soil,  “These three key resources are the foundation upon which other resource  Water and Air Resources  values and outputs depend. Healthy watersheds catch, store, and safely release water over time, protecting downstream communities from flooding; providing clean water for domestic, agricultural and industrial uses: helping maintain abundant and healthy fish and wildlife populations; and are the basis for many forms of outdoor recreation.”  Sources of Public Drinking Water  “Maintaining [watersheds contributing to drinking water] in a relatively undisturbed condition saves downstream water filtration costs. Careful management of these watersheds is crucial in maintaining the flow and affordability of clean water to a growing population.”  Diversity of Plant and Animal  “Roadless areas are more likely than roaded areas to support greater  Communities  ecosystem health, including the diversity of native and desired nonnative plant and animal communities due to the absence of disturbances caused by roads and accompanying activities. Inventoried roadless areas also conserve native biodiversity by serving as a bulwark against the spread of nonnative invasive species.”  Habitat for Threatened,  “Roadless areas serve as biological strong holds and refuges for many  Endangered, Proposed,  species. Roadless areas support a diversity of aquatic habitats and  Candidate, and Sensitive Species  communities, providing or affecting habitat for more than 280 TES species.”  and Species Dependent on Large  Undisturbed Areas of Land  Primitive and Semi-Primitive Non-motorized, and Semi-primitive Motorized classes of Dispersed Recreation  “Roadless areas often provide outstanding dispersed recreation opportunities such as hiking, camping, picnicking, wildlife viewing, hunting, fishing, cross-country skiing and canoeing. These areas can also take pressure off heavily used wilderness areas by providing solitude and quiet, and dispersed recreation opportunities.”  Reference Landscapes  “Reference landscapes of relatively undisturbed areas serve as a barometer to measure the effects of development on other parts of the landscape  Natural Appearing Landscapes  “High quality scenery, especially scenery with natural-appearing landscapes,  with High Scenic Quality  is a primary reason that people choose to recreate. In addition, quality scenery contributes directly to real estate values in nearby communities and residential areas.”  Traditional cultural properties and  “Traditional cultural properties are places, sites, structures, art, or objects  sacred sites  that have played an important role in the cultural history of a group. Sacred sites are places that have special religious significance to a group. Traditional cultural properties and sacred sites may be eligible for protection under the National Historic Preservation Act. However, many of them have not yet been inventoried, especially those that occur in inventoried roadless areas.”  Roadless Characteristics  Roadless Character Descriptions (66 Fed. Reg. 3245 (Jan. 12 2001))  Other locally identified unique characteristics  “Inventoried roadless areas may offer other locally identified unique characteristics and values. Examples include uncommon geological formations, which are valued for their scientific and scenic qualities, or unique wetland complexes. Unique social, cultural or historical characteristics may also depend on the roadless character of the landscape. Examples include ceremonial sites, places for local events, areas prized for collection of non-timber forest products or exceptional hunting and fishing opportunities.”  Information pertaining to the methodology used to assess the affects to high quality or undisturbed soil, water and air resources; sources of public drinking water; diversity of plant and animal communities; habitat for threatened, endangered, proposed, candidate, and sensitive species and species dependent on large undisturbed areas of land; and, traditional cultural properties and sacred sites can be found in the specialist reports for botany, wildlife, heritage, hydrology, and soils. To assess the effects of the treatments on primitive, semi-primitive non-motorized, and semi-primitive motorized dispersed recreation classes, the limits of acceptable change characterized by the recreation opportunity spectrum will be used. Of the seven setting indicators used to describe each level of the spectrum, naturalness is the element most likely to be impacted by the action alternatives. This setting indicator refers to the degree of naturalness of the setting; it affects psychological outcomes associated with enjoying nature and utilizes visual quality objectives to describe acceptable conditions. The presence of large contiguous areas of unmanaged land will be used to evaluate the effects of treatments on the reference landscape characteristic. The arrangement of new treatment areas on the landscape relative to existing patterns will be considered. The natural appearing landscapes with high scenic quality characteristic will be evaluated with respect to patterns across the landscape as well as what a typical user will likely see when traveling through the IRAs. No locally identified unique characteristics will be evaluated. Affected Environment Existing ConditionThis section will provide descriptions for each IRA as stated in Appendix C of the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Shasta-Trinity National Forests Land and Resource Management Plan as well as other characteristics relevant to this project. Bell Quinby The Bell Quinby IRA is comprised of 11,707 acres. This area is located approximately six miles north of Burnt ranch on the west side of the New River drainage. It is almost entirely surrounded by roads and is bounded on the north by the Trinity Alps Wilderness. The area is extremely rugged and steep with elevations ranging from 1,380 feet along New River and Quinby Creek to 5,864 feet at the north end of the unit. Vegetation ranges from mixed conifer species on the north slopes to brush fields and hardwoods on the south slopes. Present recreation use centers around hiking along a jeep and foot trail that runs through the unit (LRMP FEIS, C-9). Between 1987 and 2015, approximately 11,556 acres of the IRA has experienced at least one fire. This includes the 1999 Megram Fire (11,507 acres) and the 2015 River Complex (11,555 acres). There are currently 2.60 miles of National Forest System (NFS) roads within the Bell Quinby IRA.

This area is located about 30 miles west of Weaverville north of U.S. Highway 299. Elevations range from 5,255 feet at Ironside Mountain to 1,500 feet in the Trinity and New River canyons. Rock bluffs and steep talus slopes are predominant throughout the area. Vegetation consists of mixed conifer, oak, chaparral, digger pine, and manzanita. Present dispersed recreation use is confined along the Trinity River and New River. Fishing, rafting, hiking, and hunting occur within this corridor (LRMP FEIS, C-10). Between 1987 and 2015, approximately 27,116 acres of the IRA has experienced at least one fire. This includes the 1999 Onion Fire (9,882 acres), the 2008 Ironside and Ziegler Fires (10,877 acres and 2,169 acres) and the 2015 River Complex (10,627 acres). There are currently 0.98 miles of National Forest System roads within the Cow Creek IRA.

Expanding the area of interest to within a quarter mile of the IRA boundary there are an additional 25.89 miles of NFS roads and 22.41 miles of non-NFS roads. Little French Creek The Little French Creek IRA is comprised of 11,227 acres. This area is adjacent to and bounded on the north by the Trinity Alps Wilderness. It is located north of the town of Big Bar and about 21 air miles from Weaverville. The area is characterized by rugged terrain and steep slopes. Vegetation consists of brush fields, hardwoods, and digger pine at lower elevations (1,400 feet) while the higher elevations (approximately 5,900 feet) support mixed conifer stands. The area is used as an entrance to the southern edges of the Trinity Alps Wilderness area (LRMP FEIS, C-11). Between 1999 and 2015, approximately 10,761 acres of the IRA has experienced at least one fire. This includes the 1999 Onion Fire (7 acres), the 2003 Loma Fire (2,434 acres), the 2006 Bake Oven-Pigeon Fires (4,226 acres), the 2008 Buckhorn Fire (1,827 acres) and the 2015 River Complex (2,520 acres). There are currently 5.01 miles of National Forest System roads within the Little French Creek IRA. This includes portions of 5N16A, 5N32, 6N19, 5N04M, 33N71, 6N04, 5N13, 5N16, 5N37, 33N46, 34N14B, 34N07Y, 34N14, 33N46A, 6N04C, and 5N04. There is an additional 0.64 miles of County road (421 and 426)and 0.71 miles of private road (6N04D) within the IRA. Expanding the area of interest to within a quarter mile of the IRA boundary there are an additional 28.21 miles of NFS roads and 21.17 miles of non-NFS roads. Pattison The Pattison IRA is comprised of 28,326 acres. This area is located 14 miles northwest of the Hayfork valley. It is located equidistant from the Trinity Alps Wilderness to the north and the Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel Wilderness to the south. Elevations range from 1,650 feet along Hayfork Creek to more than 5,100 feet near Pattison Peak. Vegetation consists of large brush fields, mixed conifer timber stands, and true fir communities. At least one cultural site (an Indian village) is known to exist. The area provides habitat for some older over-mature dependent species as well as bear (LRMP FEIS, C-11). Recreation in the IRA includes hiking, hunting and fishing. Between 1987 and 2015, approximately 27,116 acres of the IRA has experienced at least one. This includes the 1987 Bear and Gulch Fires (3,449 acres and 130 acres), the 2001 Hyampom Fire (262 acres), the 2008 Eagle and Miners Fires (11 acres and 20,542 acres) and the 2015 Pattison Fire (6,834 acres). There are currently 12.44 miles of National Forest System roads within the Pattison IRA. This includes portions of 3N05B, 3N05F, 4N29, 32N31, 3N02, 3N46, 4N40, 32N30A, 33N68, 32N26, 32N16, 32N16B, 32N29, 31N50, 3N22, and 3N05. There is an additional 5.71 miles of County (301) or Private (3N04Y and U32N29AA) roads within the IRA. Expanding the area of interest to within a quarter mile of the IRA boundary there are an additional 35.04 miles of NFS roads and 12.88 miles of non-NFS roads. Salt Gulch The Salt Gulch IRA is comprised of 6,657 acres. The area has been substantially roaded since the RARE II roadless inventory. It is located approximately nine miles southeast of the community of Hayfork. Elevations range from 2,800 feet near Hayfork Creek to over 4,300 feet. The area is generally situated on a large, highly dissected ridge which forms a divide between Salt Creek and Hayfork Creek. Vegetation consists of Douglas-fir-pine-mixed conifer forests on moist, north slopes, mixed conifer forests on the less moist, north-facing slopes. And woodland-chaparral on the south-facing, dry slopes of the unit. The area contains wildlife habitat for deer. Timber harvest has occurred in the area in the past. Present recreation use is low and consists mainly of fishing (LRMP FEIS, C-12). Between 1987 and 2015, approximately 6,060 acres of the IRA has experienced at least one fire. This includes the 2008 Telephone Fire (2,960 acres) and the 2015 Rail and Shiell Fires (1,706 acres and 1,508 acres). There are currently 10.98 miles of National Forest System road within the Salt Gulch IRA.

There is an additional 0.14 miles of non-NFS road (U30N22N) within the IRA. Expanding the area of interest to within a quarter mile of the IRA boundary there are an additional 8.15 miles of NFS roads and 8.96 miles of non-NFS roads. Desired Condition Each IRA is comprised of a unique blend of habitats, species, and recreational opportunities. Rather than describing the ideal mix for each IRA potentially impacted by the project, the desired condition can be summed up by the ecosystem services this designation is intended to provide for current and future generations. “Inventoried roadless areas provide clean drinking water and function as biological strongholds for populations of threatened and endangered species. They provide large, relatively undisturbed landscapes that are important to biological diversity and the long-term survival of many at risk species. Inventoried roadless areas provide opportunities for dispersed outdoor recreation, opportunities that diminish as open space and natural settings are developed elsewhere. They also serve as bulwarks against the spread of non-native invasive plant species and provide reference areas for study and research.” (Federal Register Roadless Rule 2001, pg 3245) Environmental Consequences Alternative DescriptionsA full description of treatment alternatives is described in Chapter 2 of the EIS. This section summarizes the type and amount of treatments proposed in the inventoried roadless areas. The Roadside treatments include hazard tree abatement, commercial timber removal, fuels treatments and maintenance, planting and reforestation release elements of each alternative. Since all temporary road use, road maintenance and road reconstruction activities are imbedded within the analyses for soil, hydrology and fisheries (see those sections for details), these activities will not be explicitly discussed in this section. Alternative 1 – Proposed Action This alternative would impact 226 acres across all six IRAs. Impacts within individual roadless areas range from a low of 6 acres in the Pattison IRA to a high of 62 acres in Salt Gulch IRA. Table 3-101 characterizes the number of acres proposed for each type of treatment within each IRA. Table 3-101: Number of acres within each IRA proposed for treatment in Alternative 1 categorized by treatment type. Treatment Type  Bell Quinby  Chanchelulla  Cow Creek  Little French Creek  Pattison  Salt Gulch  Roadside  18  57  45  38  6  62  Fuelbreak  0  0  0  0  0  0  Hazard Mitigation Tree Only  0  0  0  0  0  0  Total Treatment Area  18  57  45  38  6  62  Alternative 2 – Consistent Buffer and Fuelbreaks This alternative would impact 432 acres across all six IRAs. Impacts within individual roadless areas range from a low of 8 acres in the Pattison IRA to a high of 220 acres in Cow Creek IRA. Table 3-102 characterizes the number of acres proposed for each type of treatment within each IRA. Table 3-102: Number of acres within each IRA proposed for treatment in Alternative 2 categorized by treatment type. Treatment Type  Bell Quinby  Chanchelulla  Cow Creek  Little French Creek  Pattison  Salt Gulch  Roadside  18  32  45  22  8  51  Fuelbreak  0  0  193  81  0  0  Hazard Tree Mitigation Only  0  0  0  0  0  0  Total Treatment Footprint  18  32  220  103  8  51  Alternative 3 – Wider Buffer This alternative would impact 741 acres across all six IRAs. Impacts within individual roadless areas range from a low of 17 acres in the Pattison IRA to a high of 193 acres in Cow Creek IRA. Table 3-103 characterizes the number of acres proposed for each type of treatment within each IRA. Table 3-103: Number of acres within each IRA proposed for treatment in Alternative 3 categorized by treatment type. Treatment Type  Bell Quinby  Chanchelulla  Cow Creek  Little French Creek  Pattison  Salt Gulch  Roadside  143  123  193  98  17  167  Fuelbreak  0  0  0  0  0  0  Hazard Tree Mitigation Only  0  0  0  0  0  0  Total Treatment Footprint  143  123  193  98  17  167  Alternative 4 – Northern Spotted Owl This alternative would be limited to hazard tree mitigation only treatments in important northern spotted owl habitat; with more extensive treatments allowed outside of those areas. This alternative would impact 188 acres across all six IRAs. Impacts within individual roadless areas range from a low of 6 acres in the Pattison IRA to a high of 60 acres in Salt Gulch. Table 3-104 characterizes the number of acres proposed for each type of treatment within each IRA. Table 3-104: Number of acres within each IRA proposed for treatment in Alternative 4 categorized by treatment type. Treatment Type  Bell Quinby  Chanchelulla  Cow Creek  Little French Creek  Pattison  Salt Gulch  Roadside  18  37  45  22  6  60  Fuelbreak  0  0  0  0  0  0  Hazard Tree Mitigation Only  0  20  0  16  0  2  Total Treatment Footprint  18  37  45  22  6  60  Alternative 5 – Minimum Impact This alternative only proposes hazard tree mitigation within the IRA boundary. However, all other treatment types may occur adjacent to the IRA boundary. This alternative would impact 226 acres across all six IRAs. Table 3-105 characterizes the number of acres proposed for each type of treatment within each IRA. Table 3-105: Number of acres within each IRA proposed for treatment in Alternative 5 categorized by treatment type. Treatment Type  Bell Quinby  Chanchelulla  Cow Creek  Little French Creek  Pattison  Salt Gulch  Roadside  0  0  0  0  0  0  Fuelbreak  0  0  0  0  0  0  Hazard Tree Mitigation Only  18  57  45  38  6  62  Total Treatment Footprint  18  57  45  38  6  62  Alternative 6 – No Action As the name implies, this alternative would not implement any treatment activities on the landscape, including within the IRAs. Direct, Indirect Effects Alternatives 1-5 The direct and indirect effects for alternatives 1-5 will be similar. The primary difference between alternatives is the total area and types of proposed treatments within the IRAs. Alternative 3 would result in the largest treated area with a footprint of 742 acres. Alternative 4 would result in the least amount of treated area with a footprint of 188 acres. Alternatives 1, 2 and 5 fall in-between with total footprints of 226, 432 and 226 acres respectively. High Quality or Undisturbed Soil, Water, and Air For a more in depth description of the potential impacts of these alternatives on soil, water and air, refer to the air quality and physical sciences specialist reports or their corresponding sections in chapter 3 of the EIS. Soil & Water Impacts described in this paragraph pertain to all treatment areas including those within the IRAs. Direct effects of proposed treatments on the soil ecosystem include soil disturbance, redistribution of organic matter and changes in biological properties. With the resource protection measures in place, expected compaction from mechanical operations will only increase by an average of 2 to 4% on 40% of the unit, leaving about 60% of each unit undisturbed and well below soil quality standards for compaction and extent of disturbance. Indirect effects of compaction, reduced vegetative cover and soil displacement include increased potential for rilling and erosion. However, soil cover will be improved by 15 to 35% by lopping and scattering tree tops and limbs. This will help reduce erosion potential. With soil resource protection measures in place, impacts to soils within treatment units will be minor and within thresholds described in the Forest Plan. Due to the limited area treated, any mitigating effects are small compared to the widespread damage created by the fires, resulting in insignificant changes in landslide potential. Alternative 3 and Alternative 5 will result in the greatest and least impacts to soils within the IRAs. Resource protection measures incorporated into each alternative will minimize direct impacts to water sources. Treatments may indirectly impact water quality by changing the amount and timing of sediment delivery into the stream and changing the water temperature. Felling of trees within riparian reserves can potentially reduce stream shade. Additionally, sediment deposits have the potential to create a wider, shallower stream which can also increase temperatures. Coarse woody debris in the stream channels should minimize this potential since they capture sediment before it can be deposited downstream and help form deeper pools. Air Pile burning and jackpot burning in and adjacent to the IRAs will create smoke reducing air quality and visibility within the IRAs. Given the ability to control ignition times to favor good smoke dispersion, it is not anticipated that prescribed burning would impact the local communities. Due to the relative positions of the IRAs to the communities, it is likely burning will occur on days that will disperse smoke in the direction of the IRAs. Smoke may settle in drainages overnight. Most likely the total emissions occurring on a particular burn day may not be allowed to exceed 100-200 tons of PM2.5 irrespective of the action alternative. The amount of smoke produced is directly related to the number of acres treated with some form of prescribed fire. Alternative 3 will produce the most CO2 equivalent metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, followed by Alternative 2, Alternative 1, and Alternative 4. Alternative 5 does not implement any treatments within the IRA boundary. However, it will implement prescribed fire treatments adjacent to the IRAs which will create smoke. The impacts of this smoke on the IRA will be similar to those described for Alternatives 1-4. However, since Alternative 5 has the fewest treatment acres, the amount of smoke produced and potentially impacting the IRAs will be less than all of the other action alternatives. Sources of Public Drinking Water For a more in depth description of the potential impacts of these alternatives on sources of public drinking water, refer to the hydrology specialist report or the hydrology section in chapter 3 of the EIS. Treatment activities can result in sediment directly entering streams from felled trees or increased use of stream crossings on roads. Water temperature can increase as a result of decreased shading from riparian vegetation as well as channel widening occurring after increased sedimentation. Large woody debris in the streams will help capture sediment to help maintain or increase pool depths. Project resource protection measures will minimize impacts of treatment activities on water quality (both from sediment and temperature). It is anticipated that increases in stream temperatures will be negligible. In the Middle South Fork Trinity River watershed, the Sulphur Glade Creek – Waldorf Flat subwatershed would be over the threshold of concern for all alternatives with the greatest impacts in Alternative 2. Hitchcock Creek – Oak Flat subwatershed would be over threshold in Alternative 2 and two subdrainages of Cave Creek-Swift Creek would be over threshold in Alternative 3. In the Upper Hayfork Creek watershed, a subdrainage of Halls City Creek – Wilson Creek would be over threshold in Alternative 3. Additionally in Alternative 3, a subdrainage of Barron Creek – Carraway Creek in the New River watershed would be over threshold. No watersheds within the IRAs would be over threshold in Alternative 5 and the Burnt Ranch watershed is under threshold for Alternatives 1-5. Diversity of Plant and Animal Communities For a more in depth description of the potential impacts of these alternatives on plant and animal species, refer to the botany, wildlife and fisheries specialist reports or their corresponding sections in chapter 3 of the EIS. Plant Communities The biggest threat to native plant diversity in the project area is the introduction of invasive, non-native weeds. Species diversity is typically high in healthy, intact native plant communities. Introduction of invasive species that are better competitors for limited water and nutrients almost always trigger a decrease in native species diversity in surrounding plant communities. Invasive species communities can be dominated by as few as a single weed species that cannot possibly provide the diverse habitat and forage benefits that the native communities they displaced provided. Invasive weeds are present along most roadsides throughout the project area. Proposed treatments will increase bare, mineral soil that provides habitat for invasive, non-native weeds. All ground disturbing treatments will create or increase bare, mineral soil providing habitat for nonnative, invasive species. Resource protection measures are included in the project design to reduce weed introduction and spread into the project area, but they are unlikely to stop it entirely. The magnitude of invasive weed displacement depends on how much soil gets disturbed and the proximity of the newly exposed sites to existing populations. Overall, Roadside treatments under Alternative 3 will create soil disturbance on the most acres in the project, and has the greatest potential to introduce or spread invasive weeds and reduce native species diversity. Impacts from Alternatives 1, 2, 4 and 5 will be less than those from Alternative 3. Animal Communities The relatively narrow zone of treatment limits the potential for treatments to fragment habitat in ways meaningfully measurable to wildlife species. Due to the proximity of treatments to roads, species present in and adjacent to the treatment areas have likely become somewhat habituated to human disturbance because of the effects of the existing road system and associated traffic. It is not anticipated that the treatments will have any measurable effects to diversity in the animal community. Habitat for Threatened, Endangered, Proposed, Candidate, and Sensitive Species and for Those Species Dependent on Large, Undisturbed Areas of Land For a more in depth description of the potential impacts of these alternatives on special status species and species dependent on large undisturbed areas, refer to the botany and wildlife specialist reports or the botany and wildlife sections in chapter 3 of the EIS. Plant Species There are no federally-listed plant species within the IRAs. There are also no botanical species that require large, undisturbed areas of land to persist within any of the IRAs.  Sensitive botanical species populations are rare and restricted in size by definition. None of the sixteen Sensitive botanical species that have suitable habitat in proposed treatment areas have populations within any of the six IRAs. There will be no loss of protected botanical species integrity in IRAs from the proposed treatments under any alternative. Animal Species Species that need large, undisturbed areas are unlikely to inhabit the project area, including the IRAs, which has been subject to timber harvest, road building and other human influences for over a century. Species requiring undisturbed areas are much more likely to occur in more secluded places such as Wilderness or remote portions of the IRAs. Roadside treatments that remove habitat suitable for a given wildlife species will decrease the total habitat available for that species, and may also decrease the value of adjacent habitats by fragmenting it. Hazard tree abatement and potential log removal through commercial salvage is likely to have the greatest effect on wildlife species of concern. The overall size of the treatment area and the extent of hazard tree abatement and salvage will therefore be the primary factors determining the effects of a given alternative on wildlife species of concern. Since the focus of this project is on treatment of dead vegetation, effects to habitat suitability for protected wildlife species are much more limited than they would be if the focus was on removal of living trees. Forest stands that retain high levels of canopy cover are valuable to these species. These areas have a much lower incidence of fire-killed trees that may be felled/removed by project activities compared to areas where fire severity and tree mortality was high. As a result, fewer trees will be felled and/or removed, and project effects will be lower than in areas of high fire severity. The areas that will receive the most intensive treatments are those most heavily affected by wildfire, and these habitats provide the least benefit to the majority of protected wildlife species. Riparian habitats are also especially valuable to wildlife, and riparian protections built into the project resource protection measures will also greatly limit potential effects to these wildlife species. The biological assessment for impacts to northern spotted owl determined that all treatments (within and outside the IRAs) are likely to adversely affect northern spotted owl and its critical habitat. Treatments in the IRAs represent such a small portion of the overall treatment area, it is unlikely that leaving the IRAs untreated would alter the overall effects determinations for northern spotted owl and its associated critical habitat. Aquatic Species The Trinity River system including the New River, the South Fork Trinity River and many of their tributaries are considered essential fish habitat for coho and Chinook salmon and is designated as critical habitat for the Southern Oregon Northern California Coasts (SONCC) Evolutionarily Significant Unit of coho salmon. Other species of interest in this river system include Upper Klamath-Trinity Rivers Chinook salmon, Klamath Mountains Province steelhead trout, pacific lamprey, spring-run Chinook salmon, summer steelhead (South Fork Trinity only) and resident rainbow trout. There are several rivers and creeks that flow within or adjacent to IRAs that are considered critical habitat for coho salmon. Hayfork Creek flows within and adjacent to the Chanchelulla IRA and the East Fork Hayfork Creek marks the northern boundary of the IRA. Salt Creek flows adjacent to the Salt Creek IRA while one of its tributaries, Deer Gulch, flows within the IRA. The Pattison IRA contains portions of Hayfork Creek as well as several tributaries including Corral Creek, Miner’s Creek, West Fork Miner’s Creek, Bear Creek and Little Creek. The Trinity River flows adjacent to the Little French Creek IRA as well as within and adjacent to the Cow Creek IRA. Manzanita Creek, Prairie Creek, Little French Creek, Big French Creek and Italian Creek are all tributaries to the Trinity River that flow in Little French Creek IRA. Don Juan Creek and the New River are Trinity River tributaries flowing in the Cow Creek IRA. The New River also flows adjacent to the Bell Quinby IRA. Although all of this critical habitat exists within the impacted IRAs, only the portion of Hayfork Creek adjacent to the Chanchelulla IRA and the portion of New River between Bell Quinby and Cow Creek IRAs are in close proximity to proposed treatments. The biological assessment and the biological evaluation – management indicator species reports determined that all of the action alternatives (within and outside the IRAs) may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect SONCC coho salmon and SONCC coho salmon Critical Habitat. They also determined that there would be no adverse effects to Essential Fish Habitat. A trend toward listing under the ESA is not anticipated and viability of Forest Service sensitive species is not at risk. Primitive, Semi-Primitive Non-Motorized, and Semi-Primitive Motorized Classes of Dispersed Recreation A very short section of NFS Road 33N68 intersects the Patterson IRA which is classified as semi-primitive non-motorized. The semi-primitive non-motorized class is the most restrictive in treated areas requiring a visual quality objective of preservation or retention to meet the naturalness setting indicator (ROS Field Guide). All of the remaining treatments within IRAs occur within the roaded natural and semi-primitive Motorized classes of dispersed recreation. These areas provide more flexibility allowing for a visual quality objective or modification in roaded natural and partial retention in semi-primitive motorized (ROS Field Guide). The most effective way to meet retention is to repeat form, line, color, texture, pattern and scale common to the valued landscape character being viewed (USDA Forest Service 1995). If this is done well the management activities blend into the surrounding landscape so the change is not evident. The 33N68 was used as a control line during fire suppression activities including felling hazardous trees and clearing brush. The proposed treatments are similar to these types of activities and will likely blend well with the current conditions. Additionally the portion of this treatment within the IRA is less than five acres on a short section of a much larger road that is being treated. It is likely that without treatment, this small area would stand out rather than blending in with its surroundings. The partial retention and modification visual quality objectives allow for management to be more evident. Treatments along the roads both in and out of the IRAs will provide for a consistent visual experience in the foreground, which will likely include evidence of management. Reference Landscapes A majority of the treatment acres proposed in these alternatives are the result of roadside treatments along roads outside of, but adjacent to, the IRAs. Approximately 33 miles of National Forest System roads and 8 miles of non-National Forest System roads exist within the IRAs. However, only 7.38 of those miles are proposed for treatment. This includes portions of: 07N26, 6N06, 7N28 and U402B in Bell Quinby; 5N04 in Cow Creek; 6N04C in Little French Creek; 31N04 and County Road 302 in Chanchelulla; and 30N22 in Salt Gulch. Collectively all treatments proposed in IRAs would directly impact less than 1 percent of the total combined area of the IRAs. Alternative 3 would have the largest footprint touching 0.87 percent of the IRAs. The treatment footprint for Alternative 2 covers 0.51 percent of the area while Alternatives 1 and 5 cover 0.27 percent and Alternative 4 covers 0.22 percent. Impacts to individual IRAs range from 3.19 percent of Chanchelulla IRA impacted under Alternative 3 to 0.02 percent of Pattison IRA impacted in Alternatives 1, 4 and 5. Table 3-106 shows the relative footprint of the proposed treatments under each alternative compared to the total IRA area. The amount of treated area within the IRA is very small compared to the total area and it is concentrated along existing motorized travel corridors. Additionally the proposed fuels treatments will reduce fire loading adjacent to these roads which will also reduce the potential for human caused fires to burn in or adjacent to the IRA in the future. Therefore, all of these alternatives will maintain the integrity of the larger reference landscape. Table 3-106 shows the total number of acres in each inventoried roadless area, the total treatment footprint acres for each alternative in each inventoried roadless area and then calculates the percentage of area proposed for treatment. Table 3-106.

Of the 233 miles of road proposed for treatments only 7 miles are directly within the IRA. The treatments on these 7 miles will alter the naturally appearing landscape in the short term as treatments are being implemented and medium term as cut stumps and boles are visible on the landscape. Once the understory vegetation begins to recover the visual impacts of the stumps will diminish as they become hidden by shrubs and young trees. All of the other treatments that impact the IRA are the outer edge of buffers on roads outside of, but adjacent to, the IRAs. It is likely that users of these roads will experience the same signs of management, however due to the distance to the IRA boundary will unlikely be able to distinguish the boundary between the IRA and non-IRA. Additionally the treatments follow already established road corridors in and adjacent to the IRAs there will be minimal impacts to the scenic quality and natural appearance of the larger landscape. Traditional Cultural Properties and Sacred Sites For a more in depth description of the potential impacts of these alternatives on traditional cultural properties and sacred sites, refer to the heritage specialist report or the heritage section in this Chapter. With the use of resource protection measures that require treatments to be excluded from sacred sites, there will be little if any impact to known historic or archaeological sites within the project area, including any found within the IRAs. Additionally, there are no known traditional cultural properties that will be impacted by treatments. Alternative 6 Since there will be no treatments implemented by this alternative, there will be no direct impacts to the IRAs. The ecological processes at work within the IRAs will continue. High Quality or Undisturbed Soil, Water, and Air For a more in depth description of the potential impacts of alternative 6 on soil, water and air, refer to the air quality and physical sciences specialist reports or their corresponding sections in chapter 3 of the EIS. Soil & Water Under alternative 6, there would be no new disturbance resulting from forest management activities, however existing disturbance would persist. No new adverse effects would result from this action, but in some locations productivity potential in the short term may not be as high when compared to Alternatives 1-5 because past disturbance would not be alleviated through increases in soil cover. Hydrologic function, compaction, and soil disturbance would remain at existing levels. Organic matter remaining after the 2015 wildfires would not be disturbed by management. However, soil cover standards would continue to not be met and erosion potential will remain high due to the length of time for the litter/duff layer to rebuild. Additionally, in the event of another wildfire, the chances of high-severity fire effects on soils can be much higher in areas with excessively heavy fuel loads compared to those that have been treated. Including salvage logging treatments. Additionally, future high severity fires would have an increased probability for landslides. Air Alternative 6 does not implement any treatments. Therefore, there will be no impacts to high quality air from management activities. Modeling results of a wildfire occurring in the next 20 years suggest that at least 10 percent more greenhouse gasses would be released if no management occurs than any action alternative, including emissions due to treatment and subsequent wildfire. Timing of this release is also significant since all of the emissions would occur in one event under Alternative 6 and would be spread over several years for all other Alternatives. Sources of Public Drinking Water For a more in depth description of the potential impacts of Alternative 6 on sources of public drinking water, refer to the hydrology specialist report or the hydrology section in chapter 3 of the EIS. Existing beneficial uses of water for the Trinity River and South Fork Trinity River include: municipal, domestic, agricultural and industrial supply; ground water recharge and freshwater replenishment; navigation; hydropower generation; recreation and fish and wildlife habitat. Portions of both river systems are currently listed as 303d for high levels of sediment. Some sections are also temperature impaired. Of the watersheds evaluated for cumulative watershed effects Middle South Fork Trinity River, Upper Hayfork Creek, Burnt Ranch and New River include portions of the IRAs. Based on the cumulative watershed effects analysis Middle South Fork Trinity River and Burnt Ranch watersheds have a moderate risk ratio. This means that the potential for increases in sediment are small and there is no anticipated impact to water quality. Conversely, Upper Hayfork Creek and New River all have a low risk ratio. This means that the potential for increased sediment is not measurable or negligible with respect to magnitude, extent and duration. Diversity of Plant and Animal Communities For a more in depth description of the potential impacts of Alternative 6 on plant and animal species, refer to the botany and wildlife specialist reports or the botany and wildlife sections in chapter 3 of the EIS. Plant Communities The biggest threat to species diversity in the project area is the introduction and spread of non-native invasive species. The 2015 fires created patches of bare mineral soil, which can be a good seed bed for both native and non-native species. Precautions were taken during fire suppression and fire rehabilitation efforts to minimize the introduction of non-native species in order to favor the seeding and development of native communities. Post-fire early seral habitats are very diverse, often including species that hadn’t been present on the site for decades due to increased canopy cover and resulting change in microclimates. Species diversity will likely be higher compared to pre-fire conditions as a result of these post-fire early seral habitats. This diversity will continue until these habitats mature and begin to get shaded out becoming similar in species composition to the surrounding shrub and/or forested stands. Species diversity is typically high in healthy, intact native plant communities. Animal Communities Many of the IRAs are already bisected by roads. It is likely that species living in these areas have become somewhat habituated to humans using these corridors. The effects of the 2015 fires may result in the expansion, contraction or creation of some habitat types. For example there is less old growth on the landscape which has been replaced with early seral habitat. This will benefit some species already inhabiting the area. It will cause others to move to new areas, and it will create habitat for new species to move into the area. Diversity has likely remained stable. Habitat for Threatened, Endangered, Proposed, Candidate, and Sensitive Species and for Those Species Dependent on Large, Undisturbed Areas of Land For a more in depth description of the potential impacts of Alternative 6 on special status species and species dependent on large undisturbed areas, refer to the botany, fisheries, and wildlife specialist reports or the botany, fisheries, and wildlife sections in this chapter Plant Species There are no federally-listed plant species or botanical species that large, undisturbed areas of land to persist within any of the six IRAs. Sensitive botanical species populations are rare and restricted in size by definition. None of the sixteen Sensitive botanical species that have suitable habitat in proposed treatment areas have populations within any of the six IRAs. Animal Species Species that need large, undisturbed areas are unlikely to inhabit the project area, including the IRAs, which have been subject to timber harvest, road building and other human influences for over a century. Species requiring undisturbed areas are much more likely to occur in more secluded places such as Wilderness or remote portions of the IRAs. This alternative would authorize no federal actions and have no direct or indirect effects on Northern Spotted Owl or survey and manage species. Under this alternative, no vegetation will be treated. Trees and vegetation impacted by the wildfires will continue to decay and fall without human influence. No reduction in fuel loading levels or fire hazard will be achieved. Long-term effects of this alternative on these species include continued limitations on use of the existing road system for wildfire suppression due to safety concerns, and a higher risk of widespread loss of suitable habitats to high-severity wildfire. Aquatic Species Fuels would not be reduced within any potential treatment buffers, hazard trees may not be felled and left onsite at least to the degree proposed in this Project and/or commercially disposed of, and legacy stream-road crossings may not be improved nor any roads decommissioned or addressed in any way outside of routine maintenance that would have occurred regardless of this Project. Although there would be no direct impacts, over time, there could be consequences from taking no action that could indirectly cause adverse effects to the fish or their required habitats addressed in this report. This could result from illegal or unauthorized harvest of trees within the treatment buffer because of ease of access.  Any such activities that could occur would not honor Project RPMs or BMPs so the activity would surely promote greater sedimentation or other adverse effects (Physical Sciences Report 2016). Later in time, more frequent or more severe and intense wildfires could occur if no fuels treatments were initiated in areas calculated to require them via the Project.  Road maintenance and legacy treatments including stream-road crossings and culvert upgrades would not occur resulting in a continuation of existing sediment delivery to critical habitat. Primitive, Semi-Primitive Non-Motorized, and Semi-Primitive Motorized Classes of Dispersed Recreation Approximately 33 miles of National Forest System roads and 8 miles of non-National Forest System roads are present within the IRAs. A majority of these roads are located in Bell Quinby and Chanchelulla IRAs. The limited road system has resulted in minimal management within these IRAs. There is an additional 27 miles of National Forest System Trail within the IRAs. Most of these (21 miles) are located within the Pattison IRA. The remainder of the IRAs are free from improvement and available for dispersed recreation opportunities, including opportunities for solitude. Based on the recreation opportunity spectrum classes identified in the Forest Plan, the inventoried roadless areas included in this analysis are 42 percent Roaded Natural, 36 percent Semi-Primitive Motorized, 21 percent Semi-Primitive Non-Motorized and 2 percent other. Reference Landscapes Reference landscapes are areas that are considered undisturbed and can be used to study the effects of human impacts on other parts of the landscape. The IRAs included in this analysis are relatively contiguous and in many instances located adjacent to each other with narrow road corridors separating their boundaries. The limited road system and adjacency of the IRAs results in large areas inaccessible by vehicles. Consequently little, if any, active management has occurred within the IRAs in the past two decades and the reference landscape remains intact. Natural Appearing Landscapes with High Scenic Quality The seven roadless areas identified in this analysis represent a variety of habitat types and landscapes representative of the Klamath Mountains. Approximately 95 percent of the total combined area of these IRAs has burned at least once since 1987 with most of that activity occurring between 1999 and 2015. Impacts to individual IRAs range from 92 percent (Pattison IRA) to 100 percent (Bell Quinby) of the area burned in the past 17 years. Some areas have burned more than once during that same timeframe. Although this is a lot of disturbance, fire is a natural part of these ecosystems. The variation in fire effects and the time since a given area burned has resulted in a diversified mosaic of vegetation conditions and scenery across the IRAs. Many visitors to the roadless areas will be traveling along roads or trails. Some will leave these primary travel routes and hike into the interior of the IRAs. As noted above, the natural landscape these visitors would experience is one of post-fire recovery. All of the IRAs have experienced the full range of fire severities from relatively un-touched to complete mortality creating mosaics across the landscape. In addition to the natural impacts of the fires, visitors will also be able to see the lasting impacts of fire suppression as fire control lines continue to heal and hazard tree stumps continue to rot. Traditional Cultural Properties and Sacred Sites For a more in depth description of the impacts of this alternative on traditional cultural properties and sacred sites, refer to the heritage specialist report or the heritage section in chapter 3 of the EIS. Since no management activities will be implemented, this alternative would have no impacts to traditional cultural properties or sacred sites. Summary All of the IRAs are already experiencing significant impacts as a result of recent large wildfires. Alternatives 6 would result in no treatment in the IRAs. Therefore, there would be no direct effects from treatment activities. Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects are bounded in space by the IRA boundaries and in time at five years after implementation begins. Alternatives 1-5 There have been numerous past treatments within the IRAs leading up to the 2015 fire season. This includes timber harvest, reforestation (site prep, plant, etc.), fuels treatments, seeding of understory species and pre-commercial thinning. There has also been ongoing activities associated with powerline maintenance in the Cow Creek, Little French Creek and Salt Gulch IRAs and grazing activities in the Pattison and Salt Gulch IRAs. The impacts of these activities are incorporated into the description of the existing condition. The only future foreseeable actions in the inventoried roadless areas is reforestation within the 2015 fire perimeters and the Trinity Alps Prescribed Fire Project within the Bell Quinby IRA. Reforestation will have cumulative impact on the reference landscape and naturally appearing landscape roadless characteristic. The treatment footprint for Alternatives 1-4 is relatively small compared to the full extent of the inventoried roadless areas impacted and the proximity of the treatments to roads, which already fragment the landscape. Reforestation will result in a minimal impact on the ability of each IRA to continue to be used as a reference landscape. Reforestation may or may not occur outside of the treatment areas identified for this project potentially resulting in management on more acres within the IRAs. The objective of these reforestation activities will be to return the burned area to a forested landscape as soon as possible. Areas that are reforested often appear managed for several decades as the stand matures and naturally begins to seed in improving both age class and species diversity. The presence of these reforestation areas will be visually apparent and detract from the naturally appearing landscape until the stands mature. See the physical sciences, air quality, fisheries, wildlife, botany, and heritage sections in Chapter 3 of the EIS for a full discussion of the cumulative effects to those resources. Although these sections describe the impacts from the full project and not just the IRA’s, lands within the IRA’s contribute to these cumulative effects, and in many cases will experience the cumulative impacts described. Compliance with the Forest Plan and Other Regulatory DirectionAll six alternatives would comply with the Shasta-Trinity Forest Plan and the 2001 Roadless Rule direction. The Roadless Rule states, “timber may be cut, sold, or removed in inventoried roadless areas if the Responsible Official determines that one of the following circumstances exists…to maintain or restore the characteristics of ecosystem composition and structure, such as to reduce the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire effects, within the range of variability that would be expected to occur under natural disturbance regimes of the current climatic period (36 CFR § 294.13).” Hazard trees have the potential to cause property damage, personal injury or fatality in the event of failure. In alternatives 1-5 hazard trees will be felled along roads open to the public that are located within the areas that burned during the 2015 wildfire season. The primary difference between these alternatives include the criteria utilized for identification of hazards and the level of fuel reduction treatments prescribed to treat (or not treat) felled trees. Since the intent of these activities are to improve public safety along the road system and to mitigate the increased fuel loading and subsequent increase in fire hazard, the activities proposed in Alternatives 1-4 meet the criteria stated in 36 CFR § 294.13. Alternative 5 will not treat fuels within the IRAs. Alternatives 6 would maintain the status quo and would not implement any treatments within IRAs. The 2001 Roadless Rule is intended to provide lasting protection to IRAs and sets up a system that management activities are categorized as exceptions in order to be compliant with the rule. Since no management activities would occur within the IRAs Alternative 6 complies with the rule by default. Wild and Scenic_____________________________ Introduction A Wild and Scenic Rivers analysis was conducted for two designated rivers as part of the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project. The analysis used Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (P.L. 90-542, as amended) protection requirements in conjunction with existing Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (1995) (Forest Plan) direction. Project activities were evaluated using field review, GIS analysis, and professional judgment for their potential effects to: 1) free flowing conditions; 2) water quality; and 3) identified outstandingly remarkable value(s). Analysis determined that all action alternatives would protect these values and would be fully compliant with all Wild and Scenic Rivers Act protection requirements and Forest Plan Standards and Guidelines. Select information on resource effects for outstandingly remarkable values is reiterated in this report. MethodologyProject activities were evaluated using field review, GIS analysis, and professional judgment for their potential effects to the identified outstandingly remarkable value(s). Each river shall be managed to protect and enhance the values for which the river was designated, while providing for public recreation and resource uses which do not adversely impact or degrade those values. Indicators: Fisheries: sediment, stream temperatures, and large wood; Spatial and Temporal ContextThe spatial analysis boundary for free flowing, water quality and outstandingly remarkable value is the river area or designated corridor within the 2015 fire footprints. This corridor is approximately ¼ mile on each side of the river. Temporal bounding is three years for short term effects. Long term effects would be ten years or longer. Affected Environment In 1968 the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act was established to protect American rivers, including free-flowing conditions, water quality and their many values “for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations”. As of 2012, 203 rivers encompassing 12,598 miles had been included in the National Wild and Scenic River (Wild and Scenic Rivers) System. Rivers or sections of rivers must be free-flowing and possess at least one “outstandingly remarkable” value, such as fish, wildlife, recreation, scenery, geology, history, cultural features, or other values including ecology. Wild and Scenic Rivers displaying varying degrees of existing human alteration are assigned corresponding classification levels of Recreational, Scenic or Wild. There are three designated and one recommended Wild and Scenic Rivers which are potentially affected by the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project. These are identified and described below: DesignationThe Trinity River was designated by the Secretary of Interior in 1981 as part of the National Wild and Scenic River System. The South Fork from the Trinity River confluence to the California State Highway 36 Bridge crossing was designated for its outstandingly remarkable fishery values. The New River from the Trinity River confluence to the Salmon-Trinity Primitive Area. Classification Wild and Scenic Rivers displaying varying degrees of existing human alteration are assigned corresponding classification levels of Recreational, Scenic or Wild. The Trinity River has segments classified as recreational, scenic, and wild classification. Rivers classified as “Recreational” Wild and Scenic Rivers segments display the most level of development, and may include roads, bridges, buildings, and agricultural or forest clearings. The “ Scenic” classification applies to those rivers or sections of rivers that are free of impoundments, with shorelines or watersheds still largely primitive and shorelines largely undeveloped, but may be accessible in places by roads. The “ Wild” classification applies to those rivers or sections of rivers that are free of impoundments and generally inaccessible except by trail, with watersheds or shorelines essentially primitive and waters unpolluted. River classifications that overlap the project area are listed in Table 3-107 below. Recommended River segments identified as Recommended in the Forest Plan (1995) are to be managed under similar guidance as designated rivers. This preliminary administrative recommendation to the Secretary of Agriculture is retained until such time as Congress takes action. Table 3-107: Summary of Potentially Affected Designated 115 and Recommended116 Wild and Scenic Rivers by identified Outstandingly Remarkable Value(s) River  Designated or Recommended  Designation Description  Outstandingly Remarkable Value  Trinity River –  Designated  South Fork from Forest Glen to Hidden Valley Ranch  Anadromous fishery  Trinity River – New Ri  Designated  Trinity River confluence to the Salmon-Trinity Primitive Area  Although not designated, anadromous fishery is a known value.  Trinity River – Upper South Fork  Recommended  From headwaters of the South Fork Trinity River in the Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel Wilderness to Highway 36, Forest Glen  Excellent anadromous fishery. Has been designated as a Model Steelhead Stream Demonstration Area because of habitat.  Boundaries Boundaries for Designated Wild and Scenic River corridors were established in the Forest Plan, with legal descriptions listed in Appendix E of the Forest Plan EIS. The corridor boundaries vary in width to include key river features, generally averaging about ½ mile wide (including both sides of the river) for the length of the river. Boundaries for Recommended Wild and Scenic River corridors were identified in the Forest Plan. The corridor boundaries are a uniform ½ mile width -¼ mile wide on each side of the river for the length of the river. Management of Wild and Scenic Rivers through Forest Plan Standards and Guidelines Recreation Rivers within the Wild and Scenic Rivers System will be managed to protect or enhance the values that caused them to be designated as Recreation Rivers. (Forest Plan, Roaded Natural Recreation) 115 See 46 Federal Register 7484 (Friday, January 23, 1981) 116 Forest Plan FEIS, Appendix E Scenic Rivers within the Wild and Scenic Rivers System and rivers or sections of rivers that are free of impoundments, with shorelines largely undeveloped but accessible in places by roads, will be managed to protect or enhance the values which caused them to be designated as Scenic Rivers. (Forest Plan, Semi-primitive Motorized Recreation) Wild Rivers within the Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and rivers or sections of outstandingly remarkable rivers free of impoundments and generally inaccessible except by trail, will be managed to protect or enhance the values which caused them to be designated as Wild Rivers. (Forest Plan, Semi-primitive Non-Motorized Recreation) Environmental Consequences Alternatives 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 Because of minute differences between alternatives in the Wild and Scenic River corridor, the analysis for all action alternatives has been combined into one section. The five action alternatives would authorize salvage harvest, fuels treatments, roadside hazard treatments, and site prep/planting within the river corridors for South Fork of the Trinity River and New River (see Table 3-108). For a detailed description of the alternatives, see Chapter 2 of this document. Table 3-108: Acres of Proposed Treatments for Alternatives 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 located within Wild and Scenic River corridors by River Classification. River/Segment Number (Classification)  Treatment Type  Alt 1 Acres  Alt 2 Acres  Alt 3 Acres  Alt 4 Acres  Alt 5 Acres  Trinity River – South Fork (Wild) Designated WSR  Road Buffer with Intermittent Fire Behavior Modification  43  43  78  17  16  Trinity River – South Fork (Scenic) Designated WSR  Road Buffer with Intermittent Fire Behavior Modification  <1  <1  <1  <1  <1  Trinity River – South Fork (Recreational) Designated WSR  Road Buffer with Intermittent Fire Behavior Modification  1  1  3  1  0  Trinity River – New River (Wild) Designated WSR  Road Buffer with Intermittent Fire Behavior Modification  2  2  7  2  <1  Trinity River – New River (Scenic Designated WSR  Road Buffer with Intermittent Fire Behavior Modification  11  11  17  2  0  Trinity River – New River (Recreational) Designated WSR  Road Buffer with Intermittent Fire Behavior Modification  179  179  322  183  212  Road Buffer with Fire Behavior Modification and Salvage  154  154  308  110  0  Upper South Fork Trinity (Recreation) Recommended  Road Buffer with Intermittent Fire Behavior Modification  27  27  49  0  0  Source: GIS data sort, dated 07/05/16 Direct Effects and Indirect Effects The full scope of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act’s protections can be summarized as requiring activities to protect: free-flowing conditions, water quality, and identified “outstandingly remarkable” river value(s). Free Flowing Conditions As applied to any river or section of a river, means existing or flowing in natural condition without impoundment, diversion, straightening, rip-rapping, or other modification of the waterway. Although there are portions of harvest units proposed within the river corridor boundaries of the South Fork of the Trinity River and New River, they are located several hundred feet upslope from the river and not proposed within the bed and banks of these WSRs. Therefore each alternative would have no effect on the free flowing conditions of the Wild and Scenic Rivers, since no activities are proposed within the Wild and Scenic Rivers’ bed or banks. Note:Section 7 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act does not apply to this project, because it is only pertinent to a “water resource project” such as a dam, water conduit, reservoir, hydropower project, powerhouse or transmission line, and does not directly affect the bed and bank of a Wild and Scenic Rivers. In 1984 the “water resource project” definition was evaluated for its use within the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, and the Forest Service clarified that timber harvesting or similar activities would not be subject to Section 7 review unless it resulted in an obstruction or modification of the free-flowing river characteristics (Federal Register Vol. 49, No. 10, 1/16/84, page 1901). Therefore all five alternatives will have no effect to free flowing conditions. Water Quality All five action alternatives are not expected to have direct effect on beneficial uses but should help protect water quality for South Fork of the Trinity River and New River and proposed Upper South Fork of the Trinity by fixing legacy (existing) sediment sites. The alternatives are not expected to increase sediment or stream temperature regimes over no action. A beneficial effect would be legacy site repair. (See Hydrology Report) Outstandingly Remarkable Value(s) Each river shall be managed to protect and enhance the values for which the river was designated, while providing for public recreation and resource uses which do not adversely impact or degrade those values. The primary outstandingly remarkable value for all Wild and Scenic Rivers or Recommended Wild and Scenic Rivers within the project area is fisheries. Project activities under all action alternatives would not impede free flowing conditions or cause direct and adverse effects on the identified Outstandingly Remarkable values. Considering all cumulative and foreseeable effects, implementation of any of the action alternatives will protect or enhance the Outstandingly Remarkable fisheries and cultural values, particularly in the intermediate to long-term. The outstandingly remarkable value of fisheries will benefit in the intermediate and long-term resulting from the long-term beneficial effects of the proposed action Fisheries [South Fork of the Trinity River, New River, and Upper South Fork Trinity (Recommended)] Minor and insignificant direct effects from water drafting. Overall effects to sediment, stream shade, and temperature from project treatments are expected to be discountable and effects to aquatic species are expected to be minor under all action alternatives. Should a severe wildfire occur, cumulative impacts to fish associated with increases in sediment supply, localized increases in water temperature, and reduced long-term large woody debris recruitment could result. Impacts are expected to minor to moderate depending on the spatial pattern of a high intensity wildfire. Cumulative Effects In considering current and reasonably foreseeable future projects, three other projects propose activities along the designated Wild and Scenic River corridors within the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Trinity Alps Prescribed Burn (373 acres of prescribed burning) propose activities in the New River Wild and Scenic Rivers corridor; Burnt Ranch Fire Resilient Community (50 acres of thinning and hazardous fuels reduction near community) propose activities in the Trinity River Wild and Scenic River corridor; Trinity County Transmission Line Hazard Tree Removal and Salvage (20 acres of hazard tree removal for safety) proposes activities within the South Fork of the Trinity Wild and Scenic River corridor. While these projects are currently under analysis, it is anticipated that design features incorporated would result in no effect to Wild and Scenic Rivers values. The additive effect from this project’s actions under alternatives 1-5 are not anticipated to have any cumulative effects to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act’s “protect and enhance” standards. Alternative 6 Under Alternative 6, no salvage harvest, fuels treatments, or vegetation management would occur. Existing management direction would continue to guide management of the project area. A detailed description of the alternatives can be found in chapter 2 of this document. Direct Effects and Indirect Effects Because there would be no management actions under Alternative 6, free flowing conditions and identified Outstandingly Remarkable Value(s) listed in Table 3-108 above would be maintained in this alternative. The risk posed to water quality (sediment) from identified 218 legacy sediment sites is moderate to high. Should a significant storm, such as a 10-year event occur, there is a moderate risk of failure. These impacts would adversely affect beneficial uses. The risk to water quality and beneficial uses from increased stream temperature related to burned Riparian Reserve areas is low. Cumulative Effects In considering current and reasonably foreseeable future projects, three other projects propose activities along the designated Wild and Scenic River corridors within the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Trinity Alps Prescribed Burn (373 acres of prescribed burning) propose activities in the New River Wild and Scenic Rivers corridor; Burnt Ranch Fire Resilient Community (50 acres of thinning and hazardous fuels reduction near community) propose activities in the Trinity River Wild and Scenic River corridor; Trinity County Transmission Line Hazard Tree Removal and Salvage (20 acres of hazard tree removal for safety) proposes activities within the South Fork of the Trinity Wild and Scenic River corridor. While these projects are currently under analysis, it is anticipated that design features incorporated would result in no effect to Wild and Scenic Rivers values. The additive effect from this project’s lack of action in this alternative is not anticipated to have any cumulative effects to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act’s “protect and enhance” standards. Compliance with law, regulation, policy, and the Forest Plan All Wild and Scenic Rivers Act protection requirements will be met for this project. Free flowing conditions, water quality, and identified outstandingly remarkable value(s) will be protected. River classifications will be maintained. The desired future conditions for wild, scenic, and recreational rivers will be met. Short-term Uses and Long-term Productivity ____ NEPA requires consideration of “the relationship between short-term uses of man’s environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity” (40 CFR 1502.16). As declared by the Congress, this includes using all practicable means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated to foster and promote the general welfare, to create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans (NEPA Section 101). The harvesting of dead trees (in all of the action alternatives) and the harvesting of dying trees (in alternatives 2 and 3) constitutes the short-term use of a renewable resource. As a renewable resource, trees can be reestablished and grown again if long-term soil productivity is maintained. The 2015 fires caused a reduction in soil productivity where the fires burned with moderate to high intensity.  Salvage logging and fuels treatments such as mastication can improve soil productivity in post-fire areas by increasing soil cover and adding organic material to the soil. In addition, fuels treatments are expected to reduce the fire behavior of future wildfires in the area. As a result, within treated areas, future wildfires are expected to have less of a negative effect on soil productivity than those wildfires would have in untreated (or less intensively treated) areas. Other actions have a negative effect on soil productivity.  Using heavy equipment does create erosion (which can reduce soil productivity), but erosion will be minimized through the use of Resource Protection Measures.  Also, there would be a short-term loss of soil productivity on new constructed landings.  Topsoil is removed when landings are constructed and this will lead to a reduction in soil productivity. However, wherever possible, this project will utilize natural, non-constructed landings (where topsoil is not removed).  When landings are restored, the soil will be tilled with a winged subsoiler in order to encourage the growth of appropriate vegetation for the site.  A more thorough discussion of soil productivity can be found in the soils section of Chapter 3.  On the whole, this project will maintain (and in some areas increase) soil productivity. The proposed action and action alternatives will increase forest productivity by planting trees.  The amount of biomass produced by a forest depends on the number and size of the trees—larger trees produce more biomass per year than small trees.  Planting shortens the time that it takes for late seral forest to appear on a landscape.  By planting trees, this project will ensure that greater numbers of larger trees are present on the landscape sooner than would be present if trees were not planted.  Fuels treatments will help reduce the effects of future fires so that these new forests are maintained into the future. Unavoidable Adverse Effects__________________ Unavoidable adverse effects often result from managing the land for one goal at the expense or condition of other resources.  In order to meet the Purpose and Need for this project (mitigating hazards, sustaining forest cover, capturing economic value; See Chapter 1) some adverse effects are unavoidable.  Falling trees takes away snags that can serve as habitat for wildlife. Treating fuels reduces the total quantity of down woody material that can serve as habitat for wildlife. Capturing the economic value of the trees involves the use of heavy equipment that emits pollutants into the atmosphere and mobilizes sediment that is transported to streams where it can affect water quality and aquatic habitat.  However, the extent and intensity of adverse effects will be minimized through the use of Resource Protection Measures (Chapter 2), Best Management Practices (Appendix C), and the hydrologic restoration of roads (Appendix D). Based on the analysis contained in this document, it is generally the case that the level of adverse effects correlates with the level of beneficial effects. Alternatives 2 and 3 have both the greatest beneficial effects and the greatest adverse effects.  Listed in decreasing order: Alternative 1, Alternative 4, and Alternative 5, have lower beneficial and adverse effects. The no action alternative has no beneficial effects and no adverse effects. While adverse effects of the action alternatives fall within Forest Plan standards and comply with the regulatory framework, some may view these losses as an adverse impact to the environment.  Conversely, taking no action would fail to mitigate the risk of falling trees on 233 miles of road and the fire risk associated with high levels of dead vegetation. Adverse effects are discussed in detail by resource throughout Chapter 3. Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments of Resources _________________________________ Activities proposed under the action alternatives such as felling trees, logging, hauling timber, fuels treatments, and road treatment actions will all be accomplished through the use of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are effectively a finite resource that cannot be replenished. Soil erosion results in a loss of the soil resource.  Project activities are expected to create some soil erosion, but the level of erosion will be insignificant in comparison to background levels and also due to application of Resource Protection Measures. At the same time, the fuels treatments proposed under all of the action alternatives are expected to reduce the fire behavior of future wildfires in the area. As a result, lower post-fire erosion rates can be expected in treated areas than would be expected in untreated (or less intensively treated) areas. Further, reconstruction of roads will reduce future erosion rates from the road system. A more complete discussion of soil erosion can be found in the Soil Section of Chapter 3 and the Physical Sciences Report. Also, none of the action alternatives are expected to cause new landslides or reactivate existing ones (see the Geology Section of Chapter 3). Some changes to habitat for wildlife, fish, and plants are expected but the habitat will recover from any negative changes (see Wildlife, Fish, and Botany sections of Chapter 3).  Similarly, effects to water quality and air quality are expected to be temporary.  Greenhouse gas emissions may result in a permanent increase in the quantity of atmospheric CO2 if the gases are not later removed through carbon sequestration. However, any potential increase will be at such a small scale relative to the global atmosphere that its climate-forcing effect will not be meaningfully measurable. Finally, reforestation within the treatment areas will help those areas more rapidly recover to their historic forested conditions than they would otherwise recover. Energy Requirements & Conservation Potential __ Activities proposed under the action alternatives such as felling trees, logging, hauling timber, other fuels treatments, and road treatment actions each consume energy (primarily fossil fuels). There are no unusual energy requirements associated with the action alternatives nor is it the type of proposal that provides an opportunity to conserve energy at a large scale.  Wood is a renewable resource.  Some of the timber cut could be utilized by the purchaser to produce energy which would offset fossil fuel use; however, the timber cut as part of this project is not expected to produce energy on a meaningful scale.  By applying Forest Plan Standards & Guidelines and the Resource Protection Measures listed in Chapter 2, the proposed action and alternatives will conserve resources. Urban quality, historic and cultural resources, and the design of the built environment________________ Through the implementation of Resource Protection Measures for Cultural Resources (see Chapter 2), direct effects of this project on historic and cultural resources will be prevented. Some indirect and cumulative effects to historic and cultural resources may occur due to changes in vegetation cover and fuel loading (see the Archaeology/Heritage section of Chapter 3 for additional details). Insofar as portions of this project are located within the Wildland-Urban Interface (see Map F-29), hazard reduction along roads will improve urban quality proportionate to the extent and intensity of treatments. The Proposed Action will conduct maintenance and reconstruction of roads which will improve the quality of the built environment. Hazard reduction along roads will also improve the quality of the built environment by improving road access (fewer trees falling blocking the road) and safety. A single segment of national forest system road (Road 31N49) will be closed, but this road has been identified as having safety concerns inherent in its design. Additional discussion of road-related activities can be found in the Connected Actions section of Chapter 2, the Hydrology Section of Chapter 3, and Appendices A and D. Legal and Regulatory Compliance _____________ NEPA at 40 CFR 1502.25(a) directs “to the fullest extent possible, agencies shall prepare draft environmental impact statements concurrently with and integrated with …other environmental review laws and executive orders.” The proposed action and alternatives must comply with following:  Principal Environmental Laws and Regulations The following laws and regulations contain requirements for protection of the environment that apply to the proposed action and alternatives.  The sections below explain where to find analysis of compliance with the appropriate laws and regulation.  A brief discussion of any required consultation or coordination required under the applicable law is also included.  In some cases, a permit or other form or approval is also required, as explained below: Endangered Species ActDiscussions of Endangered Species Act (ESA) compliance can be found in the following sections: Chapter 3 Wildlife, Chapter 3 Fish. There are no threatened or endangered plants so there is no analysis of ESA compliance. The Forest Service is currently in consultation with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).  A Biological Opinion will be received from FWS prior to implementation.  If FWS determines incidental take of northern spotted owls may occur, they will issue an incidental take statement. The Forest Service is also consulting with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) regarding the effects of this project on the Southern Oregon Northern California Coast (SONCC) coho salmon, which is listed as threatened under ESA.  The project Biological Assessment makes a determination that this project “May Affect and is Not Likely to Adversely Affect” SONCC coho salmon or its designated Critical Habitat. It is anticipated that NMFS will concur with this determination and will issue a letter of concurrence.  Clean Water Act The Clean Water Act is discussed in the Hydrology Section of Chapter 3, the Sediment Source Inventory (Appendix D) and in the Physical Sciences Report. As part of compliance with the Clean Water Act, the Shasta-Trinity National forest has a “Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements for Nonpoint Source Discharges Related to Certain Federal Land Management Activities on National Forest System Lands in the North Coast Region” (Waiver) from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, North Coast Water Board (Regional Water Board). The Forest consults with the Regional Water Board on each project to ensure that the project meets the terms of the Waiver. The Forest has had numerous contacts with the Regional Water Board on this project including document submittals, telephone conversations, emails, and field trips. The Forest submitted a draft Alternative Legacy Sediment Site Treatment Plan to the Regional Water Board on December 6, 2016 that included a draft of the Sediment Source Inventory Report and a Past Legacy Sediment Site Treatment GIS file. The Forest will submit a Waiver Application after the Record of Decision for this has been signed, and the Regional Water Board will then have a 30day review period. Clean Air Act The effect of the project on Air Quality and compliance with the Clean Air Act is discussed in the Air Quality Section of Chapter 3 and the Air Quality Report. Prescribed fires are regulated and authorized by the local Air Pollution Control District (APCD) and the California Air Resources Board under the process established by the California Smoke Management Program (Title 17). The legal basis of the program is found in the Smoke Management Guidelines for Agricultural and Prescribed Burning adopted by the California Air Resources Board (ARB) on March 23, 2001. Implementation of prescribed fire will require a burn permit from the North Coast Air Quality Management District, and prescribed burning will occur on approved burn days, as determined by the North Coast Air Quality Management District. National Historic Preservation Act As part of our compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act, Section 106, and in accordance with the Programmatic Agreement (PA),117 the Shasta-Trinity National Forest conducted archaeological surveys, tribal consultation, and consultation with interested parties. Formal consultation letters were mailed to the Hoopa Valley Tribe, the Karuk Tribe, and the Yurok Tribe.  No responses were received. From this work a cultural resource report was prepared and submitted for review in accordance with the PA. This report was concurred with by the Shasta-Trinity Heritage Program manager and will be reported in the Forest’s annual PA report to the State Historic Preservation Officer and Region 5 Heritage Program Manager. National Forest Management ActThe National Forest Management requires that projects proposed on a National Forest be consistent with the Forest’s Land and Resource Management Plan.  General direction from the Forest Plan can be found in the “Management Direction” section of Chapter 1. Chapter 3 analyzes the action alternatives for consistency with the Standards and Guidelines contained in the Forest Plan. Roadless Area Conservation Rule of 2001 (2001 Roadless Rule)The 2001 Roadless Rule is described in Chapter 1, management direction.  The Inventoried Roadless Areas section of Chapter 3 addresses the consistency of this project with the 2001 Roadless Rule. The effect of the proposed action and alternatives on roadless characteristics is also discussed in Chapter 3. Actions within inventoried roadless areas will be reviewed by the Regional Forester, the State of California and potentially the Chief of the Forest Service. These reviews are required for any cutting of trees within IRA boundaries. The results of the outcome of these discussions will be reflected in the FEIS. Executive Orders The following executive orders provide direction to federal agencies that apply to the proposed action and alternatives.  No inconsistencies with any executive orders have been identified. Indian Sacred Sites, Executive Order 13007 of May 24, 1996 Invasive Species, Executive Order 13112 of February 3, 1999 Recreational Fisheries, Executive Order 12962 of June 6, 1995 117 Programmatic Agreement among the U.S.D.A Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Region (Region 5), California State Historic Preservation Officer, Nevada State Historic Preservation Officer, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation Regarding the Processes for Compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act for Management of Historic Properties by the National Forests of the Pacific Southwest Region (2012). Migratory Birds, Executive Order 13186 of January 10, 2001 Floodplain Management, Executive Order 11988 of May 24, 1977 Protection of Wetlands, Executive Order 11990 of May 24, 1977 Environmental Justice, Executive Order 12898 of February 11, 1994 Use of Off-Road Vehicles, Executive Order 11644, February 8, 1972 Special Area Designations The selected alternative is designed to comply with laws, regulations and policies that pertain to the following special areas: Inventoried Roadless Areas Wild and Scenic Rivers Municipal Watersheds (FSM 2540) Research Natural Areas and Wilderness Areas are found within the project boundary (the project boundary includes the extent of all of the fires); however no treatments are being proposed in these areas. CHAPTER 4 CONSULTATION AND COORDINATION Preparers and Contributors __________________ The Forest Service consulted the following individuals, Federal, State, and local agencies, tribes and non-Forest Service persons during the development of this environmental assessment: Interdisciplinary Team (IDT) Members: Specialist  Title  Contribution  Anna Arnold  Timber Management Officer  Timber Implementation Liaison  Mark Arnold  Archaeologist  Archaeology/Heritage/Cultural Resource analysis  Ken Boucher  Fire Management Specialist  Fire and Fuels analysis Air Quality analysis  Alice Berg  Fish Biologist  Fish Analysis  William Brock  Fish Biologist  Fish Analysis  Carla De Juilio  Wildlife Biologist  Wildlife Analysis (Migratory Birds and Management Indicator Assemblages)  Talitha Derksen  Environmental Coordinator  Chapters 1 & 2, editing  Susan Erwin  Botanist  Botany analysis  Mark Goldsmith  Wildlife Biologist  Wildlife Analysis (Threatened & Endangered Species, Sensitive Species, Survey & Manage species)  Tom Hall  District Ranger  Wild & Scenic Rivers analysis  Todd Hamilton  Forester  Economics Analysis  Christopher Losi  Environmental Coordinator  Chapters 1 & 2, editing  Keli McElroy  Silviculturist  Forest Vegetation analysis  Brenda Olson  Environmental Coordinator  Fish analysis  Dan Ostmann  Fire Management Specialist  Fire and Fuels analysis Air Quality Analysis  Brad Rust  Soil Scientist  Soil analysis  David Schmerge  Hydrologist  Hydrology analysis  Lois Shoemaker  Ecosystem Staff Officer  Inventoried Roadless Area analysis  Dennis Veich  Geologist  Geology analysis  Leslie Warta  Environmental Coordinator  Chapters 1 & 2, editing  Brandon Zimmerman  GIS Specialist  Geospatial analysis, map creation  Permits and Consultation_____________________ See the “Legal and Regulatory Compliance” section of Chapter 3 for a discussion of governmental entities that the Shasta Trinity National Forest is consulting and coordinating with.

Defined by USFWS regulation as all areas to be affected directly or indirectly by the Federal action and not merely the immediate area involved in the action (50 CFR §402.02).  Active Crown Fire  A crown fire in which the entire fuel complex is involved in flame, but the crowning phase remains dependent on heat released from surface fuel for continued spread. An active crown fire may also be also called a running crown fire or continuous crown fire. An active crown fire presents a solid wall of flame from the surface through the canopy fuel layers. Flames appear to emanate from the canopy as a whole rather than from individual trees within the canopy. Active crown fire is one of several types of crown fire and is contrasted with passive crown fires which are less vigorous types of crown fire that do not emit continuous, solid flames from the canopy (Scott and Reinhardt 2007).  Activity Fuels  Fuels created by management actions  Activity Centers (ACs) (Northern Spotted Owl)  The most biologically relevant point in a northern spotted owl (NSO) territory, around which the territory is centered. The activity center is typically defined by (in order of importance) an NSO nest, pair sighting, daytime detection of a single NSO, or nighttime detection of a single NSO.  Affected Environment  In the NEPA process, the area that will be involved, influenced or created by the alternatives under consideration.  Anadromous Fish  Fish species, commonly salmon and steelhead, which are born in fresh water, migrate to the ocean to mature, and return to fresh water to lay eggs (spawn).  Aquatic Conservation Strategy (ACS)  A strategy developed to restore and maintain the ecological health of watersheds and aquatic ecosystems contained within them on public lands.  Aquatic Conservation Strategy Objectives  Objectives that “define the context for the agency review and implementation of management activities”. Complying with the ACS objectives means that an agency is managing the riparian-dependent resources to maintain the existing condition or implement actions to restore ecosystem health.  Area of Potential Effects (APE)  The area within which project activities are expected to occur that may affect historic properties.  Basal Area  The total cross-sectional area of all stems in a stand measured at breast height, and expressed as per unit of land area (typically square feet per acre). Used as a means of describing the average density of a tree stand.  Best Management Practices (BMPs)  Best Management Practices (BMP) are specific practices or actions used to reduce or control impacts to water bodies from nonpoint sources of pollution, most commonly by reducing the loading of pollutants from such sources into storm water and waterways. The US Forest Service BMP Program was developed to improve management  of water quality consistently with the Federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and State water quality programs.  Biological Assessment (BA)  Information prepared by a federal agency to determine whether a proposed action is likely to (a) adversely affect ESA listed species or designated Critical Habitat, (b) jeopardize the continued existence of species that are proposed for listing, or (c) adversely modify proposed Critical Habitat.  Broadcast Burning  A prescribed fire ignited in areas with little or no forest canopy present. Broadcast burning is used for habitat restoration and fuels reduction purposes.  Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER)  A federal program that responds immediately following a fire to assess and reduce the risk of loss of human life and property damage from threats caused by the fire. BAER prescribes emergency actions to stabilize and prevent unacceptable degradation to natural and cultural resources that might otherwise occur such as debris flows, mudslides, sedimentation, flooding, etc.  Burned Area Reflectance Classification (BARC)  A satellite-derived data layer of post-fire vegetation condition that classifies soil burn severity resulting from fire into four classes: high, moderate, low and very low.  Coarse Woody Debris (CWD)  Dead woody materials in various stages of decomposition, including sound and rotting logs, snags, and large branches. Generally considered to be at least 20-inches in diameter by all resource areas with the exception of fuels. In terms of fuels, woody material greater than 3” in diameter is considered CWD. Used interchangeably with LWD  Code of Federal Regulations (CFRs)  A codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government.  Conifer  Cone bearing tree. Generally retain leaves/needles all year.  Connected Actions  Actions that (i) automatically trigger other actions which may require environmental impact statements; (ii) cannot or will not proceed unless other actions are taken previously or simultaneously; or (iii) are interdependent parts of a larger action and depend on the larger action for their justification (40 CFR 1508.25).  Connectivity  The degree to which the landscape facilitates animal movement and other ecological flows. The linkage of similar but separated vegetation stands by patches, corridors, or “stepping stones” of like vegetation. This term can also refer to the degree to which similar habitats are linked.  Core Area (Northern Spotted Owl)  An area defined by a 0.5-mile radius around a northern spotted owl activity center that owls use most often, especially during the nesting season.  Critical Habitat  Areas designated for the survival and recovery of federally listed threatened or endangered species and that may require special management and protection.  Cumulative Effects  Those effects resulting from incremental effects of actions, when added to other past, present and reasonably foreseeable future  actions, regardless of what agency or person undertakes such other actions.  Cumulative Watershed Effects (CWEs)  The effects to water quantity, quality and the beneficial uses in a watershed that which are transmitted through the fluvial system over time.  Cumulative effects can result from the incremental effect of an action when added to past, present and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of ownership. “Cumulative effects can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time" (FEMAT, 1993). The Equivalent Roaded Acres (ERA) model to evaluate the potential impacts of land management on the balance between rainfall runoff, erosion, and stream channel response (Haskins 1983).  Decommissioned Road  A road that has been administratively removed from the National Forest Transportation System. This may be done through recontouring, barrier placement, restoration of hydrologic function through pulling culverts, etc., depending on need and road placement.  Danger Tree  Refer to Hazard Tree.  Degrade (Habitat)  The habitat characteristics would be affected but still function in the same way as pre-treatment habitat (i.e. structure may be simplified but still function as foraging habitat).  Diameter at Breast Height (DBH)  The diameter of a tree bole 4.5-feet above the ground (high side of the tree).  Direct Effects  Those effects occurring at the same time and place as the initial cause or action  Dispersal Habitat (Northern Spotted Owl)  Forested stands supporting the transience and colonization phases of northern spotted owl dispersal must be of adequate size and canopy cover to provide protection from avian predators. It is characterized by smaller diameter trees with moderate to high canopy closure (greater than 40%), or younger and less diverse forest stands than foraging habitat, such as even-aged, pole-sized stands, if such stands contain some roosting structures and at least minimal foraging opportunities to allow for temporary resting and feeding during the transience phase.  Downgrade (Habitat)  Habitat prior to treatment will no longer function as that type of habitat but will function as a lower quality habitat (i.e. previously nesting and roosting habitat would function as foraging following treatment).  Draft Environmental Impact Statement  A detailed written statement as required by section 102(2)(C) of the NEPA (40 CFR 1508.11) that is released to governmental agencies and the general public for review and comment.  Egress  A route that provides a way out of an area  Endangered Species  Plant or animal species that are in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Endangered Species are identified by the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with the Endangered Species Act of 1973.  Endemic  Native or commonly found; an endemic disease is one which is constantly present in a given area, though usually at low levels.  Endlining  Removing harvested trees by pulling or winching one end of the log with a cable pulled by rubber tired or tracked skidders. Often used when trees must be moved a short distance over steep (over 35% slope) or sensitive areas (riparian reserves) to avoid the disturbance associated with constructing a skid road or skid trail.  Ephemeral Stream  A stream that flows only in response to storms. As a result, there is typically little to no evidence of streambed scour; the bed is often vegetated and the channel is nearly always dry.  Epidemic  Prevalent and spreading rapidly among many individuals in a community at the same time, often refers to bark beetle infestations, resulting in high levels of mortality.  Equivalent Roaded Acres (ERAs)  An index of disturbance for ground disturbing activities based on the disturbance relative to a road (completely impervious and devoid of vegetation).  ERAs in a watershed are compiled and compared to a “threshold of concern” that is based on watershed sensitivity assigned to the watershed.  Erosion  A general term for movement of soil particles on the surface of the land initiated by rainfall and running water. This includes surface erosion (rill, sheet and gully) and erosion as opposed mass wasting such as landsliding.  Erosion Hazard Rating (EHR)  A rating system used to classify the relative vulnerability of soil to erosion.  Fire Behavior  The manner in which fuel ignites, flame develops, and fire spread and exhibits other related phenomena as determined by the interaction of fuels, weather, and topography.  Fire Complex  A group of individual fires in generally close proximity, managed under one command. Depending on fire behavior, these fires may combine into each other or remain separate.  Fire Hazard  A fuel complex, defined by volume, type condition, arrangement and location that determines the degree of ease of ignition and of resistance to control  Fire Intensity  A general term relating to the heat energy released in a fire.  Fire Perimeter  The entire outer-edge or boundary of a fire.  Fire Regime  The patterns of fire seasonality, frequency, size, spatial continuity, intensity, type (crown fire, surface fire, or ground fire), and severity in a particular area or ecosystem  Fire Return Interval  Number of years between two successive fires in a specified area.  Fire Severity  The level of effects of fire on the post-burn landscape. Most commonly, this refers to vegetation (often equated with basal area mortality) or soil impacts.  Fire Suppression  All work and activities associated with extinguishing a fire.  Fireline  A corridor, which has been cleared of organic material to expose mineral soil for the purpose of controlling fire spread. Firelines may be constructed by hand or by mechanical equipment (e.g. dozers).  Fish Bearing Streams  Streams that naturally support the presence of any species of fish for any duration.  Flame Length  The length of flames in a fire front measured along the slant of the flame, from the midpoint of its base to its tip.  Foraging Habitat (Northern Spotted Owl)  Forested stands that sustain abundant and available prey populations (primarily woodrats). Descriptions of foraging habitat range from mature forest stands with complex structure (Solis and Gutierrez 1990) to mature forests with lower canopy closure and smaller diameter trees than those associated with nesting/roosting habitat (Gutierrez 1996).  Fuel Size Class  The rate of change of the moisture content is dependent on the diameter of the woody fuel particle and the amount of change in environment conditions.  Historically, the diameters of the woody fuel particles have been classified according to their "time lag".  Time lag refers to the length of time that a particle responds to within 63.2% (1-1/e) of the new equilibrium moisture content (either drying or wetting). Larger diameter fuels generally have longer time-lags, meaning they respond more slowly to changes in environmental conditions. The time lag categories traditionally used for fire behavior and fire danger rating are specified as: 1hr (0-1/4” diameter), 10hr (1/4”-1” diameter), 100hr (1”-3” diameter), and 1000hr (3” and greater diameter).  Fuel Treatment  The process of removing and/or modifying natural or human created fuels to reduce fire hazard and achieve other resource objectives.  Fuelbreak  A strip of land strategically placed where hazardous fuels have been replaced with less burnable materials. Fuelbreaks divide fire-prone areas into smaller parcels for easier fire control and provide access for firefighting.  Geologic Riparian Reserves  Refer to Unstable Lands  Ground Cover  Natural organic and inorganic material that covers the watershed ground surface in sufficient quantity to allow a satisfactory rate of water to infiltrate to replenish ground water and limit erosion to natural rates. Ground cover usually consists of perennial vegetation, forest floor litter and duff, rock, downed wood, or similar erosion resistant material.  Grubbing  The removing of all vegetation within a minimum of a three-foot radius from planted or naturally regenerated seedlings. This is most often done by hand.  Habitat Connectivity  Refer to Connectivity  Hand Piling  The piling of small diameter trees, branches and/or brush by hand for burning at a later time.  Hardwoods/Deciduous Trees  Naturally shed (e.g. leaves or fruit). Perennial plants that are normally leafless for some time during the year, usually winter months.  Hazard Tree  Tree hazards include dead or dying tree, dead parts of live trees or unstable live trees (due to structural defects or other factors) that are within striking distance of people or property (a target, such as a road). Hazard trees have the potential to cause property damage, personal injury or fatality in the event of a failure. Also called danger tree for the purposes of this project.  High Hazard Potential  Hazard tree rating is defined in the Hazard Tree Guidelines for Forest Service Facilities and Roads in the Pacific Southwest Region (Report #RO-12-01). The Hazard Potential is determined by the probability of  the tree falling and its potential effect. A high hazard potential requires prompt removal of the tree or other mitigation.  High-Value Wildlife Conservation Areas (HVWCA’s)  Sites identified by the Forest and the US Fish and Wildlife Service as most valuable to northern spotted owls and most likely to support northern spotted owl reproduction.  Hydrologic Riparian Reserve  Riparian Reserves associated with intermittent stream channels, perennial stream channels, wetlands or springs.  Hydrologic Stabilization  Activities that restore hydrologic connectivity, restore soil porosity, disperse flows that may have been concentrated, and promote more natural flow paths and stability more comparable to an undisturbed site. Methods for hydrologic stabilization include subsoiling, outsloping, berm removal, water-barring, removing culverts, and providing ground cover (seeding and or mulching).  Indirect Effects  Those effects occurring later in time or that are spatially removed from the activity.  Ingress  A route that allows access into an area.  Inner Gorge  Slopes greater than 65% which occur along rivers and streams.  Intermittent Stream  Any non-permanently flowing drainage feature having (1) a definable channel and (2) evidence of annual scour or deposition. An intermittent stream typically flows longer and has more stream power than an ephemeral stream.  Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs)  IRAs provide large, relatively undisturbed landscapes that are important to biological diversity and the long-term survival of many at risk species, provide opportunities for dispersed outdoor recreation, clean water, etc. These areas are managed under the guidance of the 2001 Roadless Rule.  Irretrievable  A term that applies to the loss of production, harvest, or use of natural resources. For example, some or all of the timber production from an area is an irretrievable loss while an area is serving as a winter sports site. The production lost is irretrievable, but the action is not irreversible. If the uses changes, it is possible to resume timber production.  Irreversible  A term that describes the loss of future options, applying primarily to the effects of use of nonrenewable resources such as minerals or cultural resource, or to those factors such as soil productivity that are renewable only over long periods of time.  Issue  Point of discussion, debate or dispute about the environmental effects of the proposed action.  Ladder Fuel  Shrubs and young trees that provide continuous fine material from the forest floor into the crowns of dominant trees.  Landing  Any place on or adjacent to a logging site where logs are assembled for further transport.  Large Woody Debris (LWD)  Woody material at least 24-inches in diameter and 50-feet long that is dead and lying on the forest floor, generally in contact with the stream bed and banks. Term used for aquatic habitat, as it influences flow patterns and the shape of the stream channel which is a key element that forms quality fish habitat. Used interchangeably with CWD.  Late Successional Reserve (LSR)  Large blocks of habitat that are distributed across the range of the northern spotted owl and spaced closely enough to facilitate dispersal of owls. Late successional reserves are a Forest Plan land allocation managed to provide habitat for late-successional and “old growth” dependent species.  Limited Operating Periods (LOPs)  Specified dates that restrict management activities (1) near known wildlife nesting sites or unsurveyed suitable nesting habitat during the breeding season; or (2) restrict equipment use during periods of wet weather to avoid sedimentation into streams (also known as periods when wet weather operating standards will apply – typically October 15 to May 15).  Machine Piling  The piling of forest debris with the use of a bulldozer or excavator. Often accomplished on landings.  Maintenance Level  Defines the level of service provided by, and maintenance required for a specific road, consistent with road management objectives and maintenance criteria.  Maintenance Level 1 Road  Roads that have been placed in storage between intermittent uses. A Maintenance Level 1 road is closed to vehicular traffic but may be available and suitable for non-motorized uses.  Maintenance Level 2 Road  Roads open for use by high clearance vehicles. Constitutes the majority of National Forest System Roads on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest.  Maintenance Level 3 Road  Roads open and maintained for travel by a prudent driver in a standard passenger car. Roads in this maintenance level are typically low speed and may have stretches of single lanes with turnouts.  Maintenance Level 4 Road  Roads that provide a moderate degree of user comfort and convenience at moderate travel speeds. Most are double lane and aggregate surfaced, paved, and/or dust abated.  Management Area  A distinct geographic area with specified objectives and prescriptions under the Forest Plan.  Mastication  Grinding, crushing or chewing vegetative material using equipment (e.g. masticator).  Moderate Hazard Potential (Trees)  Hazard tree rating defined in the Hazard Tree Guidelines for Forest Service Facilities and Roads in the Pacific Southwest Region (Report #RO-12-01). The hazard potential is determined by the probability of the tree falling and the potential effect of the tree falling. A moderate hazard potential requires the documentation and tag and map of the tree (monitor) or removal of hazard tree (mitigation).  Monitoring  Process of collecting information to evaluate if objective and anticipated or assumed results of a management plan are being realized or if implementation is proceeding as planned.  National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)  Signed into law in 1970, NEPA requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their proposed actions prior to making decisions. Using the NEPA process, agencies evaluate the environmental and related social and economic effects of their proposed actions. Agencies also provide opportunities for public review and comment on those evaluations.  National Forest Management Act (NFMA)  A 1976 amendment to the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act (1974) which called for management of natural resources on National Forest System lands. NFMA provided direction for the development of land and resource management plans.  National Forest System Lands (NFS)  Consists of units of federally owned forest, range and related lands united into a nationally significant system dedicated to the long0term benefit for present and future generations. The NFS includes all national forest lands acquired through purchase, exchange, donation or other means; national grasslands; and other lands, waters or interests which are administered by the Forest Service.  National Forest Transportation System  The system of National Forest System roads, National Forest System trails and airfields on National Forest System lands.  Naturally Occurring Asbestos  Natural geologic occurrence of various types of asbestos minerals that pose a potential health risk if released into the air through ground disturbing activities. Often found in serpentine soils.  Nesting/Roosting Habitat (Northern Spotted Owl)  Northern spotted owl habitat where owls generally nest and roost. Forest characteristics include multi-layered, multi-species (including hardwoods) canopy dominated by large overstory trees; moderate to high canopy closure (60 to 90 percent); a high incidence of trees with large cavities and other types of deformities; numerous large snags; an abundance of large down logs; and open space within and below the upper canopy for spotted owls to fly. Nest sites are usually located within stands of old-growth and late-successional (late seral) forest dominated by Douglas-fir containing structures such as cavities and broken tree tops.  Non-native Invasive Species  For the purposes of this project, applies to plant species that are 1) that are not native to the ecosystem under consideration and 2) whose introduction causes or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health.  Noxious Weed  See Non-native Invasive Species  Outsloping  A method of draining roads that slightly tilts the roadbed to deflect surface water downhill perpendicular to the travel way.  Contrary to outsloping, insloped roads are tilted toward the upper slope and direct water into roadside ditches that parallel the road on the uphill side. Insloped roads require a greater level of maintenance to keep ditches clear and functioning and result in greater erosion and sedimentation potential.  Outstanding Remarkable Value (Wild and Scenic River)  A river-related value must be a unique, rare, or exemplary feature that is significant at a regional or national scale.  Perennial Stream  A stream which normally flows throughout the year.  Plantation  A stand composed primarily of trees established by planting or artificial seeding.  Post-fire Foraging Habitat (Northern Spotted Owl)  Foraging habitat that burned at moderate or high vegetation severity or nesting/roosting that burned at high severity.  Prescribed Fire or Prescribed Burning  A planned fire intentionally ignited to meet management objectives.  Primary Constituent Elements (PCE)  The physical and biological features that provide the essential life history requirements of the species.  Project Design Features  Mitigations developed and incorporated into the alternatives considered in detail to minimize or adverse impacts of the project.  Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Conditions (RAVG) After Wildfire  The product is generated for National Forest Service Lands (including wilderness) to provide information that can assist post-fire vegetation management planning designed to address a number of management objectives. The basal area loss summary table and GIS products are produced by a change detection process using two Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images or other multi-spectral imagery captured before and after a wildfire. The algorithm uses the Relative Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR), which is sensitive to vegetation mortality resulting from the wildfire event.  Recontour, Partial  A method for road decommissioning where a portion of the old roadbed is retained and is more gently outsloped than the surrounding hill slopes.  Reforestation  The natural or artificial (e.g. planting) restocking of an area with trees.  Regeneration  The act of renewing tree cover by establishing young trees naturally or artificially (e.g. planted), promptly after the previous stand or forest has been removed.  Release  Release treatments include manually removing competing plants or water uptake from competing plant roots by “grubbing” around conifer seedlings or natural hardwood seedlings.  Removal of Trees and Fuels  For salvage, removal of trees and fuels includes felling, yarding, intermediate decking of logs and hauling of the logs off-site. Removal of fuels can also apply to prescribed burning.  Resistance to Control  The relative difficulty of constructing and holding a control line as affected by resistance to line construction and fire behavior; also called difficulty of control.  Riparian Reserves  A Forest Plan land allocation that includes an aquatic ecosystem and the adjacent upland areas directly affecting it. It also includes unstable and potentially unstable lands that are not associated with aquatic areas. Specific standards and guidelines provide direction for these areas.  Risk Ratios (for CWE Models)  The amount of disturbance in the watershed relative to a threshold that is based on soils, geology, topography and geomorphic sensitivity of the watershed to disturbance.  Road Cut  Soil or rock material removed during road construction, usually from the upslope side of the road.  Salvage Harvest  The removal of dead trees after a natural event (such as a wildfire or insect and disease infestation) to remove hazards to public safety, capture the economic value of burned trees, and/or remove excessive fuel accumulation. Dead trees (or snags) exceeding those needed by other resources (e.g. wildlife habitat) are removed. Salvage harvest is also a fuels reduction activity.  Scenic Character  The aggregate of features and traits that form the individual scenic nature of an area.  Sensitive Species  Plant or animal species which are susceptible to habitat changes or impacts from management activities. The official designation is made by the USDA Forest Service at the regional level and is not part of the designation of threatened or endangered species associated by the US Fish and Wildlife Service.  Silviculture  The art and science of growing and tending forest vegetation that includes influencing the establishment, composition and growth of forests for specified management objectives.  Site Preparation  The removal or reduction of competing vegetation or logging debris, to prepare an area for planting and to promote the growth and survival of desired tree species.  Snag  A standing dead or dying tree that has lost most of its branches, or the standing portion of a broken-top tree. Snags provide cavities for nesting, perches, and feeding sites for wildlife.  Soil Burn Severity  The effect of a fire on ground surface characteristics, described in terms of char depth, organic matter loss, altered color and structure of soil, and reduced infiltration. Soil burn severity is measured in high, moderate and low classes based upon the degree of effects utilizing BARC data (See BARC).  Soil Structure  Pores or holes in the soil that hold air or water; permeability  Stand  A group of trees that occupies a specific area and is similar in species composition, age, or condition.  Subsoiling  Mechanical lifting and shattering of the layer of soil beneath the topsoil in order to reduce soil density and strength, improve moisture infiltration and retention, and increase root penetration in the soil.  Temporary Roads  Roads authorized by contract, permit, lease, other written authorization, or emergency operation not intended to be a part of the forest transportation system and not for long-term resource management. Any new temporary roads created during implementation of this project would be restored.  Territory (Northern Spotted Owl)  An area defined by a 1.3 mile radius around a northern spotted owl activity center within which owls forage, nest and roost. The terms home range and territory are often used interchangeably.  Understory Vegetation  Vegetation (trees or shrubs) growing under the canopy formed by taller trees.  Underburning  A prescribed fire in forests or woodlands that is not lethal to the dominant, overstory vegetation and thus does not change stand structure substantially.  Unstable Lands  Riparian Reserves associated with active landslides (including earth flows), inner gorges, toe zones of dormant landslides, or steep-weathered granitic lands.  Vegetation Burn Severity  The effect of a fire on vegetation, often described by the degree of scorch, consumption, and mortality of vegetation. Vegetation burn severity is measured by classes of canopy mortality or basal area mortality (basal area mortality in the case of this project).  Watershed  The entire land area that drains to a specific point (e.g. 5th Field watershed generally consists of more than 40,000 acres in size; 6th field sub-watershed ranges from about 10,000 to 40,000 acres in size)  Wild and Scenic River  A river that is either already designated or proposed for designation because of its free flowing condition and outstanding remarkable values.  Wildland Urban Interface (WUI)  Commonly referred to as the WUI (woo-ee).

Other comments offered recommendations for implementation of the proposed action. Some comments related to the NEPA process itself and to procedural concerns for effects analysis. Issue Disposition Process Issues are statements of cause and effect, linking environmental effects to actions (FSH 1909.15 Ch. 12.41). Issues serve to highlight effects or unintended consequences that may occur from the proposed action and alternatives, giving opportunities during the analysis to reduce adverse effects and compare trade-offs for the decision maker and public to understand (FSH 1909.15 Ch. 12.42). The Interdisciplinary Team reviewed comments from the public and other agencies in order to identify key issues. Key issues will then be carried forward in the environmental analysis process as a way to develop alternatives (alternative driving issues) or analyze alternatives (analysis-driving issues) (FSH 1909.15 Ch. 12.4). Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Comment AnalysisComments and concerns were assigned to one of the following categories. Similar issues were grouped by subject matter. This process is documented below. 1. Alternative-Driving Issue (key issue): Alternative-driving issues generally concern resources that may be impacted by implementation of the proposed action and cannot be completely resolved through project design. An alternative-driving issue is addressed by developing and analyzing an alternative to the proposed action or by creating a modification to the proposed action. Such modifications may take the form of resource protection measures or mitigation measures that are applied to the proposed action as well as multiple alternatives. If a new alternative is created, it may be analyzed fully or, if it does not meet the purpose and need, is illegal, is based on inadequate scientific evidence or is sufficiently similar to an alternative already considered in detail, the alternative will not be considered in detail. Some alternative-driving issues are also analysis-driving issues, as described below. 2. Analysis-Driving Issue (key issue): Analysis-driving issues relate to a cause and effect relationship between the proposed action and its effects. They suggest a method to measure effects and identify potential effects caused by the proposed action that are relevant to the decision to be made and suggest how important or ‘significant’ an effect might be. Analysis issues are carried through effects analyses by project specialists. Analysis issues will be analyzed in the project effects portion of environmental impact documentation. A description of the indicators used and the reasons for using those indicators can be found in the relevant resource section of the EA. Procedural Concern (non-key issue): These are issues that may be addressed through implementation of standard design features, or completion of processes routinely conducted by the interdisciplinary team. It is common to receive scoping comments reminding the agency to consider or conduct certain processes, such as consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or cumulative effects analyses. Procedural concerns may also address the methodology behind the analysis and why it is appropriate. For example, the analysis may include the use of a model or qualitative discussion of key resource characteristics based on professional expertise. 3. Other concern (non-key issue). Other concerns are designated as such for any of the following reasons: a) The issue is beyond the scope of the project. The issue does not meet the purpose and need for action, falls outside of the project area, or is beyond the power of the agency to address. b) The issue is unrelated to the decision to be made. c) The issue is already decided or required by law, regulation, or policy. d) The issue is conjectural and not supported by scientific or factual evidence. e) The comment is general in nature, such as a position statement, and does not provide sufficient specific information which can be used to analyze effects. f) The comment asks a question that can be answered succinctly in the analysis document or in the response to comments. g) The comment requests a modification to the proposed action without explaining the environmental, social, or economic effect that such modification would address. Although not a true issue, these comments are carried forward to the alternative development stage. h) The comment has been resolved through inclusion of a project design feature or a resource protection measure. i) Statement of support. Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Summary of Issue Statements: Alternative Driving Issues: 1. Removing dead trees will negatively impact native species, habitat, clean water and forest resources; therefore, include an alternative that not include post-fire logging where it's not directly impacting busy roads. Addressed in Alternative 7. 2. Removal of burned trees would have a negative impact on northern spotted owls; therefore, analyze an alternative that would not remove burned trees in high value northern spotted owl areas. Addressed in Alternative 4 and 5. 3. Salvage logging has a negative impact on use of burned areas by northern spotted owls; therefore, consider an alternative that does not impact areas that would be used for post fire foraging by northern spotted owls. Addressed in Alternatives 4 and 5. 4. The project could have a negative impact on northern spotted owl habitat; therefore, an alternative should be considered that minimizes or eliminates impacts to northern spotted owls. Addressed in Alternatives 4 and 5. 5. Treatments in Inventoried Roadless Areas would affect the natural environment and could have a negative impact on TES species; therefore, consider an alternative that does not treat in IRAs. Addressed in Alternative 5. 6. The proposed action does not fully address the hazard tree conditions; therefore, an alternative should be considered that allows a wider treatment buffer where necessary to address the hazard. Addressed in Alternative 3. 7. Future high severity fire is a concern in the project area which will not be addressed by the proposed action; therefore, analyze an alternative that includes effective fuelbreaks, including treatments of green vegetation and maintenance. Addressed in Alternative 2. 8. The proposed action should do more to address traveler safety along roads; therefore, analyze an alternative that includes silvicultural treatments (including thinning green vegetation) downhill from treated roads. Addressed in Alternative 2. 9. The proposed action should do more to address traveler safety along roads during fires; therefore, analyze an alternative that includes wider treatments, especially downhill from treated roads. Addressed in Alternative 3. 10. The proposed action would leave felled hazard trees outside the treatment buffer, which leads to heavy fuel loading; therefore, consider an alternative with a wider treatment buffer that would allow all felled hazard trees to be removed. Addressed in Alternative 3. 11. The proposed action only proposes to remove trees that are dead at the time of implementation, but this does not address all of the trees that will die from fire damage, which means the treatments do not fully address the hazard; analyze an alternative that would remove dying trees as well as dead trees, consistent with the Region 5 Hazard Tree Guidelines and the Region 5 Fire Injured Tree Guidelines. Addressed in Alternatives 2 and 3. 12. The Limited Operating Periods impact ability to implement salvage treatments; therefore, consider an alternative that does not include LOPs. Addressed in Alternative 8. 13. The proposed planting density is lower than recommended for future timber management; therefore, analyze an alternative that would have a heavier planting density. Addressed in Alternative 3. Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage 14. The project could negatively impact watersheds that are already over the threshold of concern; therefore, consider an alternative that minimizes treatments in those watersheds. Addressed in Alternative 5. 15. Machine piling has a negative impact on soils; therefore, analyze an alternative that would not include machine piling. Addressed in Alternative 5. 16. Logging has a negative impact in Riparian Reserves; therefore, analyze an alternative that does not include logging in Riparian Reserves. Addressed in Alternative 5. Analysis Driving Issues: 1. Project activities will produce sediment that could reach streams; therefore estimate the quantity of sediment delivery. 2. The proposed action will generate CO2 emissions; therefore, estimate CO2 emissions for each alternative. Comments and Responses 1.EPIC Comment: Using Healthy Forest Restoration Act authority the Project proposes approximately 8,100 acres of post-fire logging and other treatment methods on 233 miles of road, including 153 miles of Maintenance Level 2, 34 miles of Level 3, 19 miles of Level 4 and 27 miles of state and county roads. Treatments would be used to treat up to a 300 foot total buffer. The Project area is proposed within five different fire complexes and the Saddle Fire, containing multiple land allocations including Late Successional Reserves and Riparian Reserves and is also within Critical Habitat for northern spotted owl (NSO) and possibly for coho salmon. Response: That summary is accurate; however, since scoping began, it has been determined that HFRA will not be used for this project. Issue Disposition: General in nature 2.EPIC Comment: While the Shasta-Trinity National Forest website did provide a map of the multiple 6th field watersheds, the Scoping notice did not provide a list of all affected watersheds. Please be descriptive in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement as to which are Key watersheds, 303(d) listed watersheds and which serve as coho critical habitat. Please also provide a list of the Management Areas that are proposed for treatment. These details will be needed in order to provide site-specific concerns and more well informed comments. Response: A map showing management allocations is shown in Chapter 1 of the EIS.  The description of watersheds in the Hydrology Section of Chapter 3 notes whether the watershed is a Key Watershed.  Streams which serve as Critical Habitat for coho can be found in Table 3 of the document labeled “Fish BE and MIS Report” under “Miles of Anadromous Fish Streams.”All of the HUC 5 watersheds are listed as sediment-impaired under section 303(d) of the clean water act except for the Canyon Creek and New River watersheds. These latter watersheds are considered reference watersheds. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 3.EPIC Comment: We realize the need for public safety and believe that public safety can be addressed while limiting the impacts to wildlife, clean water, and forest resources. Focus on Highest Priority Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Areas Please focus treatments on the highest priority areas-these include essential ingress/egress routes, strategic firefighting and fire lighting positions, homes and other structures. Response: Impacts to wildlife, water and forest resources are considered in the effects analysis, vary between alternatives, and are minimized to the extent practicable in the Resource Protection Measures. Burned-forest as wildlife and plant habitat is considered in the wildlife and botany effects analyses in Chapter 3 of the EIS. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #1. Issue Statement: Removing dead trees will negatively impact habitat, clean water and forest resources; therefore, an alternative should analyze fewer treatments on lower use roads. 4.EPIC Comment: We note that Level 2 roads comprise the vast majority of the treatment areas. We question whether there is a need to do the same amount of roadside treatment along these roads as other, higher priority roads. An equal level of public safety could likely be achieved through individual hazard tree removal. Level 2 roads, generally speaking, contain a higher level of sediment legacy sites and are more likely to run through Late Successional Reserves (LSRs) and northern spotted owl (NSO) Activity Centers. Response: Maintenance Level 2 roads are open to the public; therefore, they must be maintained at a level that provides for user safety as much as possible. Impacts to northern spotted owls and their habitat will be analyzed in the EIS. Legacy sediment sites will be considered in the hydrology analysis. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #1. Issue statement: Removing dead trees will negatively impact habitat; therefore, an alternative should analyze fewer treatments on lower use roads. 5.EPIC Comment: As highlighted in the most recent demographic study, Katie M. Dugger et al. The effects of habitat, climate, and Barred Owls on long-term demography of Northern Spotted Owls. The Condor: Ornithological Applications, December 2015, the owl is in decline across its entire range and that rate of decline in increasing. As the best available science shows, northern spotted owls readily utilize forests that have burned at high-severity for foraging. Logging post-fire forests removes structural complexity and reduces the habitat value to owls. Given the decline of the owls, EPIC and other conservation groups are strongly opposed to removing habitat within LSRs and owl circles. Furthermore, inclusion of these areas may trigger formal consultation with USFWS, potentially delaying implementation of the Project. Response: The project wildlife biological assessment will address the potential effects of climate change and barred owls on northern spotted owls in the project area. Effects to northern spotted owl critical habitat units and LSR's will also be addressed. Issue Disposition: Alternative Driving Issue #2. Issue statement: Removal of burned trees would have a negative impact on northern spotted owls; therefore, analyze an alternative that would not remove burned trees in LSR and northern spotted owl home ranges. 6.EPIC Comment: Retain All Live Trees Please follow the recommendation of the Trinity Collaborative to retain all live trees, meaning trees with any green foliage. Please note that this recommendation was likewise made by AFRC in their scoping letter: "Prioritize areas of completely dead. Mixed green will create a longer analysis period and will also make sale preparation more complex." Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Response: The proposed action includes the retention of all live trees at time of implementation. Other alternatives may be analyzed that include removal of fire-injured trees with a high probability of mortality, as requested by other interested parties including AFRC ("utilize Regional Salvage Guidelines"). The Regional Salvage Guidelines refers to the Forest Service Publication Marking Guidelines for Fire-injured Trees in California (Smith and Cluck 2011) which provides scientifically-based direction in identifying trees with a high probability of mortality based on crown scorch, cambium injury and insect evidence during post-fire salvage operations. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action 7.EPIC Comment: Ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pines, and red fir often appear dead after a fire (i.e., 0% green needles). However, given time, the trees will "flush" the dead needles and regenerate. The Service should take care when marking trees for removal and avoid marking ponderosa pine, red fir, or Jeffrey pine trees before late summer. A recent study on tree flushing provided the following recommendation: The ability of large red fir, and ponderosa and Jeffrey pines to flush and survive high or complete levels of crown scorch implies a need for caution in making early estimates of fire effects in large-diameter stands. To avoid overestimating high-severity effects, our study suggests remote-sensing and field-based assessments of fire severity should be conducted after flushing is completed in the late summer of the year following the fire. Similarly, where managers seek to remove roadside hazard trees along popular recreation roads, as was the case in our McNally fire study sites, early severity estimates (i.e. before completion of the following year's growing season) may lead to needless felling of many large, old trees based on the erroneous assumption that they are dead. Our data strongly suggest assessments of post-fire mortality be postponed until the passage of one post-fire growing season. Additional study is needed to more completely determine the degree of flushing and survival in a variety of site conditions for ponderosa and Jeffrey pines, and red fir (Hanson, C.T., and M.P. North. 2009. Post-fire survival and flushing in three Sierra Nevada conifers with high initial crown scorch. International Journal of Wildland Fire 18: 857-864). Response: The paper provided (Post-fire survival and flushing in three Sierra Nevada conifers with high initial crown scorch; Hanson and North 2009) refers to the direct effects of a fast moving fire that defoliates a crown but does not kill the cambium. This was not the case with the majority of the fire-affected area that burned slowly in August 2015. Needle flushing, as discussed in the article, occurs in the growing season after the areas burned. For this burned area, that would begin in spring of 2016. The proposed action only proposes to treat dead trees at the time of implementation, and implementation would occur in August 2016 at the earliest, after any potential flushing would occur. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action 8.EPIC Comment: Any proposal to extract live trees raises the controversial issue of mortality models and marking guidelines for designating "dying" trees. There is an extensive scientific literature on the delayed mortality of fire-damaged conifers on forests of the western United States. Inspection of the cambium layer can provide a more accurate indication of potential tree mortality. Response: There is extensive scientific literature on the delayed mortality of fire-damaged conifers in western forests. The current guiding document for our purposes is the Marking Guidelines for Fire-Injured Trees in California ("Region 5 Salvage Guidelines"; Smith and Cluck 2011) which is a synthesis of contemporary science. This document utilizes cambium injury, combined with crown scorch and insect activity to come up with a probability of (delayed) Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage mortality on an individual tree basis. Recurring years of drought is further contributing to higher than normal levels of mortality not fully accounted for in these mortality predictions. The proposed action would remove only trees fully dead at time of implementation, and not utilize mortality prediction models. An alternative may be developed that does use the Region 5 Salvage Guidelines. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action. 9.EPIC Comment: Ecosystems on sites damaged by the passage of fire are in a stressed condition and are the least able to withstand further disturbance. All trees that have a chance of surviving are needed to play critical roles in natural site regeneration. They should be preserved, even if some will later die. They provide site-adapted seed sources for new trees, shade for seedlings that is critical under the xeric conditions of most western forests, and a host of benefits to wildlife. If a few later succumb, they will provide snag habitat useful to wildlife. Surviving trees in LSRs provide a significant residual of larger trees in developing stands. Defects caused by fire may accelerate the development of structural characteristics suitable for associated species. All standing live trees should be retained including those injured. Response: The proposed action includes removal of only trees that are dead at time of implementation. Other alternatives may analyze removal of fire injured trees that pose hazards to roads consistent with Forest Service Region 5 policy. Fire-injured trees that are likely to survive will not be removed under any alternative associated with this project unless they pose a hazard to operations. Please note that this proposal does not include landscape salvage efforts, but focuses on the areas adjacent to open roads in order to reduce public safety hazards. Over 144,000 acres that burned in 2015 on the Forest are not being treated, providing a substantial amount of fire-affected structural characteristics for associated species. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action. 10.EPIC Comment: Snag and Coarse Woody Debris Retention "Snags provide a variety of habitat benefits for a variety of wildlife species associated with late-successional forests. Accordingly, following stand-replacing disturbances, management should focus on retaining snags that are likely to persist until late-successional conditions have developed and the new stand is again producing large snags." -FEMAT 1993, p. III-37 Please include a per acre snag retention requirement of the largest diameter class snags within treatment areas. The ecosystem benefits of snag forest stands cannot be overstated, as explained in the Northwest Forest Plan and Shasta-Trinity Land Resource Managements Plan (LRMP). Large diameter snags persist the longest on the landscape and increase the habitat value of early seral forests. They store the most carbon and provide necessary habitat for many species. Response: The Forest recognizes the importance of snag retention as an ecosystem component. Over 160,000 acres burned during the 2015 fires. The purpose and need of this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. Snags deemed hazards to these roads within the narrow treatment buffer will be removed. Only snags that are not hazardous would be retained in the treatment buffer. It is unlikely these will occur consistently or predictably; therefore, it is infeasible to develop a snag retention requirement beyond a statement that says snags that are not hazardous will be retained. However, the proposed action does not include treatment on the remaining 144,000 acres that burned in the 2015 wildfires on the Shasta-Trinity. The large amounts of snags in these burned areas would contribute to the snag habitat component on the landscape, which occur at levels far exceeding minimum retention standards Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage directed in the Forest Plan and Forest Level Late Successional Reserve Assessment (LSRA; 1999). Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project 11.EPIC Comment: Some species of snags, in particular Sugar pines on ridgetops may have significant cultural value. Response: There is no current or historic ethnographic information suggesting dead standing snags along ridgelines and in particular Sugar Pine were spiritually important. Various tree species were culturally important to the Wintu people but as living food sources; oaks for their acorns, Ponderosa pine (yellow pine) Cambium layer as a last ditch starvation food, and gray pine for their nuts. Sugar pine were used for their nuts and the resin (sumukurkur) gathered in summer mornings before it melted and eaten as candy. Cora A. Dubois 1935. Wintu Ethnography, University of California Press, Berkeley, California The fine roots of the Sugar and Ponderosa Pine were also used for basketry. Douglas fir and Incense cedar bark was also collected from dead snags for roofing material on lodges and bark shelters. The tree species mentioned had no more or less importance if they were found along a ridgeline, side of a canyon, or valley bottom (Ray Patton, Nor-Rel-Muk Wintu elder 2016. Personal Communication). Issue Disposition: Conjectural and not supported by scientific or factual evidence 12.EPIC Comment: Leaving the largest material on the ground should also be considered. Further, we recommend the retention of all legacy snags (snags which were standing before the fires) or snags that already feature complex structures, such as cavities. We also recommend that the Service retain all hardwood snags. Response: The Forest recognizes the value of snags and logs as ecosystem and habitat components. Under this project proposal, over 144,000 acres burned in the 2015 wildfires will not be affected and will retain legacy snags as well as those killed by wildfire and/or resulting from secondary mortality (insects, disease, cambium injury). As such, treatments proposed under this project are not stand or watershed-level treatments, but instead are limited to the removal of hazards along open roads. Snags deemed hazards within an identified buffer from an open road will be felled, regardless of whether they existed prior to the fire or not and regardless of species. Snags outside of buffers will only be felled if they are operational hazards and will not be removed. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project 13.EPIC Comment: Because of the important role of dead wood in late-successional and old-growth forest ecosystems, and because there is much to learn about the role of dead wood in the development of forests, only limited salvage is appropriate in Late-Successional Reserves. The Final Draft Recovery Plan [for the NSO] would allow removal of small-diameter snags and logs, but would also require retention of snags and logs likely to persist until the new stand begins to contribute significant quantities of coarse woody debris." -FEMAT 1993, p. IV-37 Response: Tree mortality is a natural process in a forest ecosystem and snags and logs are an important ecosystem component. In this case, over 144,000 acres experienced wildfire on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, adding a considerable number of dead and dying trees to the landscape. The proposed action would treat less than 5% of affected area on the Forest. This action is focused along open roads, where hazards pose a danger to humans. Fuels reduction Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage would occur in the road buffer, but would only remove logs that exceed desired habitat conditions. Landscape or watershed-level salvage and fuels reduction treatments are not a component of the proposed action. Management for late successional characteristics within LSRs does acknowledge and promote decadence, which provides habitat value for many species. The LSRA provides direction on appropriate treatments following large-scale disturbance, and recommends all standing live trees with a likelihood of survival be retained as well as standing snags with a likelihood to persist and large logs present prior to the disturbance. It also acknowledges that removal (salvage) of snags and logs may be necessary to reduce hazards to humans along roads and trails. These principles are incorporated into this project's design. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action 14.EPIC Comment: Please note that the contribution of very large logs (> 20 inches in diameter) to fire severity and intensity is negligible, as they are the fuels least available for combustion. When these large logs do burn, it is because the smaller fuels needed to ignite them and sustain combustion are present. Logs also burn mainly by smoldering combustion, which is not considered in the calculation of fire intensity. This is the reason why relatively high fuel loads comprised primarily of large-diameter woody material can be present without eliciting high intensity fire effects. Large downed logs can also provide important shade structures that obstruct solar radiation and surface winds. These microclimate influences can result in lower ground surface temperatures and reduced surface wind speeds, which translate into higher live and dead fuel moisture levels compared to areas cleared of shade from standing or downed trees. Large downed logs can also reduce the speed and variability of surface winds, which inhibits extreme or erratic fire behavior. Thus, the ability of large downed logs to store water and provide shade from the sun and wind can function to lower the fire intensity and rate of spread on those specific sites. Concerns with the removal of large standing dead and down trees (Modernizing Federal Forest Management To Mitigate and Prepare for Climate Disruption: Science-based Recommendations to The Obama Administration in Response to The President's November 1, 2013 Executive Order: Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change), (National Old-Growth Conservation Policy -Scientist Letter) collectively known as coarse wood, include the numerous ecological roles that it plays in forest ecosystems including roles as: * Long-term sources of energy and nutrients; * Aggregated sources of soil organic matter, which form important parts of soil matrices; * Structural elements of the landscape that influence hydrologic and geomorphic processes within aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems; * Significant modifiers of microclimatic regimes in the post-disturbance ecosystem; and, most profoundly; * Habitat for a large array of animals, including the majority of vertebrate and large numbers of invertebrate species. Response: The Forest understands the importance of large log retention. To meet the ecological role of large logs, the proposed action includes retention of 10-20 tons per acre of greater than 3" diameter wood, with a preference for retention of the largest diameter logs. Large logs in excess of 20 tons per acre would pose safety concerns for wildland firefighters in suppressing fires (Brown et al. 2004). Treatments under this project are restricted to a narrow buffer along roads; less than 5% of the burned area would be treated, leaving large areas with high levels of coarse wood. Impacts of large log reduction to fire behavior and ecology will be evaluated in chapter 3 of the EIS. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action 15.EPIC Comment: Tree mortality is a natural process in a forest ecosystem. Diseased, damaged and dead trees are key structural components of late-successional forests. Accordingly, management planning for LSRs must acknowledge the considerable value of retaining dead and dying trees. Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage All standing live trees should be retained and management should focus on retaining snags that are likely to persist until late successional conditions have developed and the new stand is again producing large snags. Response: Tree mortality is a natural process in a forest ecosystem and snags are an important ecosystem component. In this case, over 144,000 acres experienced wildfire on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, adding a considerable number of dead and dying trees to the landscape. The proposed action would treat less than 5% of affected area on the Forest. This action is focused along open roads, where snags often post a danger to humans. Landscape or watershed-level salvage and fuels treatments are not a component of this proposed action. Management for late successional characteristics within LSRs does acknowledge and promote decadence, which provides habitat value for many species. The LSRA provides direction on appropriate treatments following large-scale disturbance. The LSRA recommends all standing live trees with a likelihood of survival be retained as well as standing snags with a likelihood to persist and large logs present prior to the disturbance. It also acknowledges that removal (salvage) of snags and logs may be necessary to reduce hazards to humans along roads and trails. These principles are incorporated into this project's design. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action 16.EPIC Comment: Please include in the analysis how each LSR would be affected, why it was included in the reserve system and how the proposed project would alter LSR function or connectivity. Response: Actions proposed under this EIS are consistent with the LSRA. Design Criteria #7 (Fuels Reduction) pertains to "area(s) that received a stand-replacing event such as those caused by wind, fires, insect infestation, volcanic eruptions, or diseases. The area impacted is larger than 10 acres in size and has had crown closure reduced to less than 40% except in areas with heavy concentrations along roads that can pose a risk as a point of ignition.” This project affects trees and snags impacted by the 2015 wildfires along open roads, and it is not anticipated to significantly affect the functionality of any LSR with treatments. The analysis will cover the effects of the project on Critical Habitat (2012) which incorporates much of the LSR system as well and substantial additional areas of habitat suitable for the northern spotted owl. The designation of LSR as a land allocation indicates a general wildlife emphasis for prescriptive management, but is not in itself an entity that would be relevant for a project impact analysis. Information on each LSR and their intended function is incorporated in the Forest Level LSRA as well as the Clear Creek LSRA (1998). These assessments and the direction therein was reviewed and approved by the Regional Ecosystem Office, tasked with interagency issue resolution and interpretation of implementation under the Northwest Forest Plan. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of this project. 17.EPIC Comment: There are dozens of watersheds that may be affected by the use of heavy equipment on haul routes and roads proposed for treatments. We are concerned about the amount of roadwork and landing construction and reconstruction that may be proposed, primarily on the 153 miles of Maintenance Level 2 roads. Please be descriptive in the forthcoming NEPA analysis concerning the location and level of roadwork and landing construction that would be required to accommodate large trucks and heavy logging equipment. Response: The cumulative effects of each of the watersheds (HUC 5, 6, 7 and 8) that may be affected by the proposed action and each of the alternatives will be analyzed. The estimated number of new landings needed for project activities is shown in Chapter 2.  Maps of the haul routes are included in the sediment source inventory.  Road maintenance will depend on the needs Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage of the contractors and will be determined by the roads engineer.  Road repairs/upgrades will depend on requirements stipulated in the North Coast Regional Water Board Waiver which will be determined after the decision. Issue Disposition: Analysis driving Issue: Project activities will produce sediment that could reach streams; therefore estimate the quantity of sediment delivery. 18.EPIC Comment: Please provide a detailed inventory list of all legacy sediment sites and plans to treat these chronic sources of sediment to our waterways and how the Project will follow requirements for clean water. From the revised North Coast Water Quality Waiver R1-2015-0021 (with emphasis added): Legal and Regulatory Structure # 26, "The conditions in this Waiver provide reasonable assurance that sediment, temperature, and nutrient impairments on NFS lands will be restored by requiring: 1) protection, maintenance, and enhancement of riparian conditions and shade; 2) inventories and remediation of legacy sediment sites; 3) the application of BMPs and on--the--ground prescriptions on NFS land to avoid excess sediment discharges and to improve shade; and 4) periodic review, monitoring, and reassessment." # 32 of the USFS 2015 Waiver, "This Waiver contains four primary components. The primary components are: 1) the maintenance and restoration of designated riparian zones pursuant to the Aquatic Conservation Strategy and Aquatic Management Strategy; 2) the timely implementation of watershed restoration plans that require inventories, prioritization, and treatment of legacy sediment sites; 3) BMPs for site--specific activities including the implementation of on--the--ground prescriptions; and 4) a Monitoring and Reporting Program (MRP)." # 34 of the USFS 2015 Waiver, "The USFS will actively addresses legacy sediment sites or pre-existing threats to water quality through identification, prioritization, and treatment of such sites within Category B projects and/or through essential projects in the WCF process as described in Finding Nos. 13--15. This Waiver requires that all active and potential legacy sediment sites be identified, inventoried, prioritized, scheduled, and implemented for treatment for all Category B projects and/or through the WRAP (see Category B Condition No. 1). If the USFS does not have a WRAP for the sixth field subwatershed where a Category B activity is proposed for coverage under this Waiver, the USFS must propose treatments of all existing legacy sediment sites within the project area as part of the proposed project. Grazing allotments are exempt from the requirement to identify and treat legacy sediment sites. Trading the treatment of legacy sediment sites inside a Category B project area with legacy sediment sites outside of the project area may be acceptable, provided the treatment sites are within the same sixth field subwatershed and it can be demonstrated that the proposed treatments provide an equal or greater benefit to water quality. Such alternatives shall be submitted to the Executive Officer for approval. (See Category B Condition No. 2)" On page 17 of the 2015 USFS Waiver, "This Waiver is consistent with Resolution No. 68--16 because overall it will result in a net benefit to water quality by setting forth conditions that implement riparian and shade protections and enhancements, address legacy sediment sites, and implement BMPs and on--the--ground prescriptions for new activities. The activities permitted under this Waiver have been determined to have a low potential impact to water quality when conducted pursuant to the terms of the Waiver, resulting in compliance with applicable water quality control plans, including applicable water quality objectives." Under the 2015 waiver it is clear that the treatment of legacy sediment sites is mandatory. It is not adequate to rely on Project Design Features (PDF) and Best Management Practices (BMP) to mitigate all watershed impacts -as PDFs and BMPs are not 100% effective and not implemented 100% of the time. Please show a good faith effort in treating the ill effects that the current road system is having on our streams and rivers. Response: This project will comply with the revised North Coast Water Quality Waiver, and applicable BMPs and Resource Protection Measures will be included in project design and implemented. Many legacy sediment sites in the burned area were addressed during fire Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage suppression repair and Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) treatments. Remaining legacy sediment sites will be disclosed in the Sediment Source Inventory. Sediment creation from many of these legacy sites will be reduced as a condition of the North Coast Regional Water Board Waiver but the sites to be treated will be determined as part of the Waiver coverage, which will be determined after the signing of the ROD. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 19.EPIC Comment: The Shasta-Trinity National Forest is responsible for completing sub-part A of the Travel Management Rule to determine the minimum road system needed and which roads it is able to maintain. Please consider whether or not any of the Level 2 roads within the analysis area would more appropriately be decommissioned, particularly any high-risk low use roads. Reducing the equivalent roaded acres in highly fragmented watershed may mitigate impacts from logging and treatment activities. Response: The Travel Analysis Process (subpart A of the Travel Management Rule) has been completed and is currently in review. Upon review completion, projects may be considered that would implement the TAP recommendations. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project. 20.EPIC Comment: We are concerned with the cumulative affects from; road use, roadwork and reconstruction, landing expansion or possible construction, wildfires, suppression activities and the increased possibility of sediment delivery to stream courses from post-fire debris flows. Please provide actual data and sedimentation amounts from the fires, fire suppression actions and the proposed activities as well as any other present or future activities in the Project area. Response: Cumulative effects to watersheds will be analyzed in the hydrology section of the EIS and the Physical Sciences Report.  The effects of the 2015 wildfires and wildfire suppression are included as part of the existing conditions described in the Physical Sciences Report and Chapter 3 of the EIS.  The estimated quantity of sediment delivery from wildfire can be found in the BAER reports. The estimated quantity of sediment generated by the proposed activities is disclosed in the Physical Sciences report and analyzed in Chapter 3. The effect of the project on post-fire debris flows is discussed in the geology section of Chapter 3.  Issue Disposition: Procedural Concern. 21.EPIC Comment: Refugia are a cornerstone of most species conservation strategies. They are designated areas that either provide, or are expected to provide, high quality habitat. A system of Key Watersheds that serve as refugia is crucial for maintaining and recovering habitat for at-risk stocks of anadromous salmonids and resident fish species. Northwest Forest Plan B-18 Key Watersheds are the highest priority for watershed restoration. Removing large old trees and snags that are contributing critical elements of forest and riparian structure with ground-based and cable yarding, roadwork, landings and skid trails would degrade riparian values and watersheds at large. Please be descriptive in how the Project will meet Aquatic Conservation Strategy objectives. Response: Key watersheds affected by the proposed action include Upper South Fork Trinity River and New River. The Forest Plan allows for timber harvest in key watersheds provided a Watershed Analysis (WA) has been completed. WAs have been completed for both of the key watersheds. The Forest Plan allows timber harvest in riparian reserves after fires if it is required Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage to attain Aquatic Conservation Strategy objectives, and if watershed analysis determines that present and future coarse woody debris needs are met. The proposed action and alternatives will be analyzed to determine whether or not they meet the Aquatic Conservation Strategy objectives, and this analysis is contained in Appendix E. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 22.EPIC Comment: Please analyze and disclose all cumulative effects as well as the proposed Project and how treatment activities would affect coho salmon and their critical habitat. Response: A fisheries analysis regarding effects from the project will be completed and disclosed in the EIS. This analysis will include the anticipated direct effects, indirect effects and Cumulative effects for Coho salmon and their Critical Habitat. A fish Biological Assessment will also be completed and consultation with National Marine Fisheries Service will occur to comply with the Endangered Species Act. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 23.EPIC Comment: The agency must analyze and disclose accurate impacts to owls and consider the best available scientific information. In order to protect this federally threatened species, which is currently petitioned for up listing and also a California candidate species, the agency must follow recommendations of the NSO Revised Recovery Plan, particularly Recovery Action #12. Response: Potential effects to northern spotted owls will be analyzed in the project wildlife analysis and will be disclosed in the EIS. All recovery actions in the revised Recovery Plan that are pertinent to the activities proposed will be addressed in the Biological Assessment. Additionally consultation with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will occur to comply with the Endangered Species Act. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 24.EPIC Comment: Positive and negative effects to NSO habitat were created during the multiple fire complexes. Please analyze and disclose the change in baseline condition to NSO habitat. Considerable fire suppression activities occurred throughout the project area, including among other things, bulldozer and hand fire lines and application of fire retardant. The cumulative impacts to NSOs from these fire suppression measures must be included in the forthcoming analysis. Environmental review and consultation under the Endangered Species Act must include these emergency measures in any environmental baseline calculation. See 50 C.F.R. § 402.02. Failure to include these measures in the baseline would render any baseline analysis arbitrary and capricious. Response: The Forest is in communication with the US Fish and Wildlife Service to update the northern spotted owl habitat baseline, incorporating the effects of wildfire and suppression activities. The updated baseline will be used for the analysis of project impacts in the Biological Assessment. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 25.EPIC Comment: Cavity-nesting species are prime beneficiaries of fires, and 62 species of birds and mammals use snags, broken-topped, diseased or otherwise "defective" trees for roosting, denning, foraging, or other life functions. The Northwest Forest Plan (NFP) at C-45-46, "White-headed Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Woodpecker, Black-backed Wood Pecker, Pygmy nuthatch and Flammulated Owl-These species will not be sufficiently aided by application of mitigation measures for riparian habitat protection or for marbled murrelets alone." "Specifically, the Scientific Analysis team recommends that no snags over 20 inches DBH be marked for cutting." The White-headed Woodpecker, Pygmy nuthatch and Flammulated Owl all have habitat ranges within the project area. Please describe how the Project will consider these species in treatment planning. Response: The "Record of Decision and Standards and Guidelines for Amendments to the Survey and Manage, Protection Buffer, and other Mitigation Measures Standards and Guidelines" contains the recommendation cited in this comment, as well as recommended levels of snags per acre for the species addressed in this comment. The potential effects to these species will be analyzed in the project wildlife reports. The information in this document was taken into account in designing the proposed action, which achieves the purpose and need while minimizing potential effects to these species. The purpose and need of this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. In this case, over 144,000 acres experienced wildfire on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, adding a considerable number of dead and dying trees to the landscape. The proposed action would treat less than 5% of burned area on the Forest, leaving large tracts of land to provide habitat for cavity-nesting species. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 26.EPIC Comment: The value of CWD, which provides vital forest structure for the fisher, is without question. Because the agency has not performed surveys as required by the LRMP at page 4-30 and does not have any specific population data or location information, it is important to provide ample adequate habitat. The LRMP states that, "current management direction is to provide a network of suitable habitat to include linkage in the form of dispersal habitat. The direction is being fulfilled with the implementation of the LSR and riparian reserve systems." Because the project will affect multiple LSRs and riparian reserves please be descriptive on how the Project will maintain, protect and enhance fisher habitat. Response: The project Wildlife Biological Evaluation will include the known distribution of fishers in the analysis area as documented in the Forest and State of California wildlife databases. The effects of the project on fishers and fisher habitat will be assessed in the project Wildlife Biological Evaluation. Resource Protection Measures addressing retention of large logs for wildlife habitat are being developed. The purpose and need of this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. In this case, over 144,000 acres experienced wildfire on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, adding a considerable number of dead and dying trees to the landscape. The proposed action would treat less than 5% of burned area on the Forest, leaving large tracts of land to provide large logs as habitat for fishers. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern. 27.EPIC Comment: Please consider marking only trees that have an imminent danger and a high hazard rating as provided in the Region 5 guidelines. Please provide hazard tree evaluation forms for trees in moderate and low fire severity areas. Response: Trees that are likely to fail and cause injury to people or property on Forest Service System lands along open roads will be identified as hazard trees, consistent with the Region 5 Hazard Tree Guidelines (Angwin et al. 2009). Tree hazards include dead or dying trees, dead parts of live trees, or unstable live trees (due to structural defects or other factors) that are within Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage striking distance of people or property (a target). Hazard trees have the potential to cause property damage, personal injury or fatality in the event of a failure (Hazard Tree Guidelines, page 2). It is important to note that a dead tree with potential to hit an open road will receive a high hazard rating and the treatment areas under all alternatives are focused along roads. Under the proposed action, certain sensitive areas will only have imminent danger trees addressed as identified under the Region 5 Hazard Tree Guidelines (e.g. Nesting/Roosting, Foraging, and Post Fire Foraging Habitat for the Northern Spotted owl within High Value Wildlife Conservation Areas—See Resource Protection Measure 2 in Chapter 2). Under Alternative 4 and 5 large areas of treatment will have hazard tree mitigation only, and under Alternative 5 there will be no salvage removal at all. Treatment of only imminent hazard trees and not the excessive fuels that pose a hazard to the road does not meet the purpose and need of the project. The purpose of completing hazard tree evaluation forms is to have a record of the overall structural condition of a tree that can be used to determine progression of defects over time and to document the frequency of certain defects within developed sites (Hazard Tree Guidelines, page 32). Completion of these time-intensive forms is not feasible for this large project area when the purpose of this project is focused on high-rated hazard trees along roads that must be treated in a time sensitive manner. Issue Disposition: Incorporated as a thread through all alternatives (marking imminent danger trees with a high hazard rating). Beyond the scope of the project (limiting fuels reduction to only hazard trees; providing hazard tree evaluation forms). 28.EPIC Comment: The ability of the Region's forestlands to sequester and store carbon has become a matter of national and international significance. Region 5 Ecological Restoration Implementation Plan p.2 Please make an attempt to utilize at least some rudimentary objectivity regarding the carbon emissions involved in logging, yarding, and processing timber from our public lands. Please look at; the rate of CO2 emissions from standing snags compared to snags that are taken off site, the role of down rotting logs on soil carbon levels or future stand development and CO2 capture, the role of forest soils on carbon sequestration, the impacts of increased fire hazard (via slash and plantation establishment) for the first 20 years after harvest on carbon sequestration should there be another stand replacing fire, the influence of the low surface to volume ratio of slash, sawdust and disposable wood products compared to the high surface to volume ratio of large snags and down wood on carbon sequestration. Response: Carbon Dioxide emissions and carbon sequestration will be addressed in chapter 3 of the EIS. Your input on issues to be considered in that analysis will be considered. Issue Disposition: Analysis driving issue. Issue statement: The proposed action will generate CO2 emissions; therefore, estimate CO2 emissions for each alternative. 29.EPIC Comment: The Forest Service has a duty to reduce and eliminate noxious weeds on our public lands. The proposed action exacerbates an already critically high risk of introducing and/or spreading invasive plant species. The Project must consider actual on-the-ground impacts of the further spread of invasive species as well as long-term effects to our forests. Response: A Weed Risk Assessment will be prepared for the project. The Assessment will analyze the effects of the project on non-native, invasive species populations within the project boundaries. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage 30.EPIC Comment: We encourage the use of whole tree harvesting which will reduce the amount of activity slash and fine fuels created during implementation. Please be descriptive in how slash abatement and maintenance will be timed and performed. Response: The interdisciplinary team considered the use of whole-tree yarding during project development. Whole tree yarding of dead trees can have a greater impact on soils because dead trees tend to be less flexible than live trees. Also, the areas that burned at high severity often lack of soil cover, so leaving some of the smaller material in the stand can help mitigate soil cover loss from the fires. The DEIS will include details regarding slash treatments. Issue Disposition: Conjectural and not supported by scientific or factual evidence. 31.EPIC Comment: Given the overall affects to our watersheds from the multiple fire complexes, the amount of different land allocations, the occurrence of coho and NSO and their Critical Habitat and the number of watersheds proposed for treatment we believe that an EIS is the appropriate choice for analysis. Response: The level of NEPA analysis is dictated by the level of impacts expected to occur from the proposed action. An EIS is required when project impacts are expected to be significant. Impacts of the proposed action are expected to be significant due to the size of this project, the cumulative effects of the fire impacts, the number of watersheds impacted by fire and the proposed action, and the amount of sensitive wildlife habitat in and within close proximity to the proposed action; therefore, an EIS is the correct NEPA analysis type. The scale of the project would need to be significantly changed to reduce the level of impacts to non-significant, which would leave many miles of wildfire impacted roadside untreated. Issue Disposition: Statement of support. 32.EPIC Comment: We urge the Shasta-Trinity National Forest to retain all live trees, retain an adequate amount of the largest snags and CWD (including hardwoods) in treatment units, limit roadwork, road use and landing construction and adequately consider the watershed affects of the road system including haul routes and treatment areas. Response: The proposed action would only treat dead vegetation, and would retain all live trees. Snags would be considered for retention where they do not pose a hazard to the road or to workers, and snags would only be treated in a narrow buffer along roads leaving 95% of the burned area providing snag habitat. Given the narrow buffer proposed, it is likely that most, if not all, snags would be considered hazardous; however, the buffer is narrow, allowing for retention of large amounts of snags immediately adjacent to the buffer. The proposed action includes retention of 10-20 tons per acre of coarse woody debris, which would include hardwood logs. The proposed action includes no temporary roads, and only proposes road maintenance, which would improve or protect water quality. Resource Protection Measures are being developed for landing construction. Impacts of the project on watersheds will be analyzed in chapter 3 of the EIS. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action (retain all live trees, retain an adequate amount of snags and CWD, limit roadwork, road use and landing construction). Procedural concern (adequately consider the watershed effects of the road system). 33.EPIC Comment: Please do send a hard copy of the Draft EIS when it becomes available. Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Response: The commenters have been added to the project mailing list and will be informed of any opportunities to comment as the project planning proceeds. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement. 34.CC Comment: Please incorporate them into the AR and respond to them in the DEIS response to public comment section. Response: The comments are incorporated into the administrative record for the project and are responded to in this response to comments document. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement. 35.CC Comment: First, we request how the areas selected for logging were chosen? Was a particular methodology used and if so what was it? Considering the size of the various fire complexes we would like to know how the project was developed and what criteria was used. Response: The proposed action includes treatment along all open roads (National Forest System roads with a maintenance level of 2, 3, or 4, as well as county and state roads) within the footprints of wildfires that burned in 2015 on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, in order to make them safer for travel. Some areas along these roads were identified for salvage (removal of dead trees through a timber sale or related contract) based on economic viability. All roads were first evaluated using GIS maps overlaid with RAVG fire severity data. The areas identified in RAVG data as having burned at high and moderate severity were field verified by Forest Service personnel with expertise in identifying commercial timber value. During these field verification visits, they identified areas that experienced high and moderate vegetation burn severity that contained economic viability, which is comprised of merchantable timber that is large enough to retain structurally sound segments after 1 year of post-fire deterioration. Fuels reduction and salvage treatments proposed are entirely a function of open road mileage through lands administered by the Forest Service that burned in 2015. Issue Disposition: Asks a question that can be answered succinctly in the analysis or response to comments. 36.CC Comment: Why is the FS seeking an ESD? It would appear that with the proposed analyses the project can't proceed for at least one year post fire. That hardly demonstrates an "emergency" or threat to public safety. It does appear to be an attempt to cut the public out of the NEPA process by denying any opportunities to file an Objection. If the FS considers the areas a threat to public safety are all roads identified on the map closed to public travel? If not, why? Response: The Forest Service is not currently seeking an ESD. Issue Disposition: Asks a question that can be answered succinctly in the analysis or response to comments 37.CC Comment: The FS claims this project is within the WUI. Please define the WUI the FS is using? About 67% of the roads proposed for logging are along class 2 roads that are not open to passenger level vehicles. They can only be traveled by ATVs or high clearance vehicles. Is the FS claiming these roads are regularly used by the residents in the WUI for transportation to and from their communities? We request the distance from each class 2 road to the nearest community. Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Response: The WUI boundaries for this project are defined in the EIS using the Trinity County Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP). The Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) is a general term derived from the Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HFRA) to describe the area where homes and wildland meet. The Federal Register (Region 5. January 4, 2001. Vol. 66, No.3. Pp. 751-754) defines the WUI as the “line, area, or zone where structures and other human development meet or intermingle with undeveloped wildland or vegetative fuel.” The WUI boundaries established in this Trinity County CWPP Update were developed to help prioritize project planning and funding for pre-fire (prevention) projects to help aid in protecting communities at risk for wildfire (Trinity County CWPP, 2010).While Maintenance Level 2 roads are generally not recommended for use by passenger vehicles, the condition of and amount of use of those roads varies widely. Regardless of the amount of use, the hazard trees still pose a hazard to people that are using them. While much of the project is in WUI, and many of the roads are used for ingress and egress from rural communities, that is not the driving factor behind the purpose and need and proposed action. The primary purpose of the project is to reduce hazards along roads open to the public. Roads and communities will be shown on project maps in the EIS for proximity. Issue Disposition: Asks a question that can be answered succinctly in the analysis or response to comments. 38.CC Comment: The majority of the project area is within Northern spotted owl designated critical habitat and LSRs set aside for late-successional species such as NSO, fisher and marten. The best available science demonstrates NSO will use all levels of burned habitat but will not use salvage logged habitat. We incorporate by reference in their entirety the comments being submitted by Wild Nature Institute and written by Monica Bond (attached -CC is submitting on her behalf). We request the FS seriously consider the science cited in her comments and respond to it in the DEIS. We have previously provided these papers to the STNF but if it requires them again let us know and we will send them. Response: Project impacts to at-risk species, including the fisher, marten and northern spotted owl and other bird species, will be analyzed in the wildlife reports. Impacts to potential northern spotted owl post-fire foraging habitat will be included in the analysis. The analysis of the potential project impacts will be based on the available scientific data and pertinent scientific literature. The review of scientific literature will include the documents cited in comments. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue. Issue Statement: Salvage logging has a negative impact on use of burned areas by northern spotted owls; therefore, consider an alternative that does not impact areas that would be used for foraging by northern spotted owls. 39.CC Comment: In addition, we are including a new paper "The effects of habitat, climate and barred owls on long-term demography of northern spotted owls," published in The Condor and authored by Katie M. Duggar, Eric Forsman, Alan Franklin and Raymond Davis who is a Forest Service researcher. The paper may be found at: http://www.aoucospubs.org/doi/pdf/10.1650/CONDOR15-24.1 This paper shows NSO populations declined by 55-77% in WA; 31-68% in OR; and 3255% in CA. Furthermore, the FWS has stated the NSO may be considered for uplisting to endangered status and that review is ongoing. Not all of the declines are blamed on Barred owls. "The amount of suitable habitat required by spotted owls for nesting and roosting is important because spotted owl survival, colonization of empty territories, and number of young produced tends to be higher in areas with larger amounts of suitable habitat." The revised recovery plan also speaks to agencies protecting all suitable habitat used by NSO, and burned habitat remains suitable. Based on the information in Ms. Bond's comments; the scientific peer-reviewed papers she cites; and this new paper we believe the NSO should be a driving factor in the development of Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage this project and at least one alternative should be developed with the NSOs life needs considered as a priority. Response: The scientific paper cited, and the revised Recovery Plan, are two of many documents that will be considered in the project design process and the analysis of potential effects to northern spotted owls. As a species listed under the federal Endangered Species Act, it is necessary for all project alternatives to consider the life needs of northern spotted owls, and include measures to limit potential effects to this species while still meeting the purpose and need of the project. This process will include assessing the suitability of burned areas for northern spotted owls and the potential effects of activities in burned areas. Acres of suitable habitat available to this species, and the effects of proposed activities on these habitats, will be analyzed in the wildlife biological assessment for the project. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #4, Issue Statement: The project could have a negative impact on northern spotted owl habitat; therefore, an alternative should be considered that minimizes or eliminates impacts to northern spotted owls. 40.CC Comment: Per the revised recovery plan for the NSO we quest all historic territories, new territories and suitable habitat within all home ranges be protected from proposed activities. If the FS chooses not to do so, please explain why and how removal of habitat from territories is beneficial to the NSO. Along these lines, what is the STNF doing to protect, maintain, and/or restore owl populations on the Forest, as required under the ESA? Project by project we see intrusions into designated critical habitat, LSRs and more recently IRAs. These areas are to be managed for TES species yet they all experience large commercial logging operations and the NSO continues to decline across the STNF and throughout its range. Response: Resource Protection Measures are being developed that will minimize potential effects to northern spotted owls while still meeting the project purpose and need. The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. Impacts to the northern spotted owl, including impacts to suitable habitat and home ranges will be included in the Biological Assessment. The Forest actively coordinates with the US Fish and Wildlife Service in designing projects that will have long-term benefits to northern spotted owls while minimizing potential short-term impacts to this species. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue. Issue Statement: The project could have a negative impact on northern spotted owl habitat; therefore, an alternative should be considered that minimizes or eliminates impacts to northern spotted owls. 41.CC Comment: The STNF has enough time to implement at least one season of NSO protocol surveys using the 2012 protocol, which is the best available scientific protocol. We request it do so and if it doesn't explain why. We also request any survey results be included in the DEIS along with the dates the surveys were conducted. Please include all NSO territories in the project area including the amount of habitat in the nest core and home range. Response: Due to the urgent need to address hazards to public safety, there will not be adequate time or opportunity to conduct protocol surveys for northern spotted owls in this very large project area. Analysis of potential effects will be based on the extensive existing data in Forest and State of California wildlife databases. The analysis will address NSO home range locations, potential direct effects to NSO, current habitat levels for NSO, and effects of project activities on the suitability of these habitats for NSO. Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 42.CC Comment: Barred owls are habitat generalists and will use more open habitat. Since some burned areas have become more open and salvage logging will open them up even more, the FS must consider how the project may exacerbate barred owl invasion. Response: Recent scientific literature and the revised recovery plan for northern spotted owls identifies barred owls as a major threat to northern spotted owls. Accordingly, the project wildlife biological assessment will address the potential effects of barred owls on northern spotted owls in the project action area. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 43.CC Comment: The Forest also must consider climate change to NSO. The Duggar paper mentioned above suggests survival of young spotted owls and their ability to become part of the breeding population increased when winters were drier, yet climate predictions include warmer, wetter winters in the Pacific Northwest. How will this large project area contribute to climate impacts on NSO? Response: The potential effects of climate change on northern spotted owls in the project area will be addressed in the project wildlife biological assessment. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 44.CC Comment: Please include the Environmental Baseline for the NSO used in this project. Virtually every large timber sale on the Trinity has included removal of some owl habitat. Take has also been authorized in some of these projects. We encourage the FS to develop a legitimate and defensible EB because it has not used one in the past as we demonstrated in our 60-Day NOI back in 2010 [Re: Glitzenstein]. The EB and its methodology should be included in the DEIS or posted on the STNF website under this project. Response: An updated assessment of habitat suitability for northern spotted owls (environmental baseline) in the project area will be produced as part of the wildlife analysis for this project. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 45.CC Comment: The scoping notice states none of the logging is proposed in wilderness but is silent on entries into IRAs. Please clarify. The FS must follow the Roadless Rule for any entries into IRAs and there are restrictions on logging limited to small diameter trees. And specific criteria must be met to remove those small trees. We encourage the FS to stay out of IRAs because they are to be managed for TES species habitat per the LRMP; as well as retain their natural environment. Furthermore, please clarify how any IRAs are in WUIs. Response: The Forest is aware of and intends to comply with the Roadless Rule. This proposal, and the removal of hazards along open roads is consistent with the Roadless Rule (2001) which states: "Under this final rule, management actions that do not require the construction of new roads will still be allowed, including activities such as timber harvesting for clearly defined, limited purposes, development of valid claims of locatable minerals, grazing of livestock, and off-highway vehicle use where specifically permitted. Existing classified roads in inventoried roadless areas may be maintained and used for these and other activities as well. Forest health treatments for the purposes of improving threatened, endangered, proposed, or sensitive species Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage habitat or maintaining or restoring the characteristics of ecosystem composition and structure, such as reducing the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire effects, will be allowed where access can be gained through existing roads or by equipment not requiring roads." (FR, Vol 66, No 9, Jan 12, 2001, p 3250). The Forest is not proposing landscape-level treatments within IRA, but is committed to improving safety on already existing, open roads within the IRA. Further information will be included in an IRA report. WUI is a function of existing infrastructure. Some Inventoried Roadless Areas are within WUI. Maps showing WUI and IRA will be provided in the EIS. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #5. Issue Statement: Treatments in Inventoried Roadless Areas would affect the natural environment and could have a negative impact on TES species; therefore, consider an alternative that does not treat in IRAs. 46.CC Comment: The scoping notice states high severity burned areas "generally" have no remaining live trees, and areas burned at moderate severity also have a high likelihood of deforestation or large pockets of mortality due to fire injury. The notice also states that all levels of burned areas exist along the proposed roads, yet states only "dead" vegetation will be "treated." Please clarify whether any trees that are not "dead" will be proposed for logging. Response: The proposed action would only treat dead vegetation. No green vegetation would be treated under the proposed action in either timber harvest or fuels reduction treatments. However, removal of trees injured by the fire (with some green remaining) that are likely to die or that would pose a hazard as defined by the Hazard Tree Guidelines will be analyzed under an alternative. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 47.CC Comment: We request the FS verify the accuracy of its assumptions pertaining to hazard trees. The Bagley Fire Complex area that burned on the STNF in August 2012 was also considered a threat to public safety because of "dead and dying" trees. We went on a fieldtrip with FS personnel in August 2015 -3 years after the fire -and did not find downed trees everywhere. In fact, the FS opened the roads for hunting in September 2015 yet no logs had been removed. We asked the FS to show us what they considered a "hazard tree" and FS personnel did not show us even one tree. This example of a similar project on the same forest is important because it demonstrates the FS assumptions regarding hazard trees are invalid. Response: Tree hazards include dead or dying trees, dead parts of live trees, or unstable live trees (due to structural defects or other factors) that are within striking distance of people or property (a target). Hazard trees have the potential to cause property damage, personal injury or fatality in the event of a failure (Angwin et al. 2012). Forest Service personnel identified hazard trees consistent with the Hazard Tree Guidelines for Forest Service Facilities and Roads in Pacific Southwest Region (Angwin et al. 2012), which is based on best available science, Forest Service policy and OSHA regulations. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 48.CC Comment: Water quality is a significant issue on the Trinity River due in large part to logging and the erosion it has caused, as well as road construction. We request the FS take a "hard look" at the cumulative impacts of salvage logging to each affected watershed as well as the cumulative effects to the Trinity River. Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Response: Cumulative watershed effects analyses will be completed for each HUC 5, 6, 7 and 8 watershed affected by the proposed action and each alternative. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 49.CC Comment: The same "hard look" analysis should be conducted for soils since salvage logging on disturbed soils is known for harmful impacts. Response: Impacts to soils from salvage are covered in the physical science report and in chapter 3 of the EIS. The analysis constitutes a hard look with field sampling and review of proposed units using appropriate metrics developed from the Shasta-Trinity Land and Resource Management Plan and current science. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 50.CC Comment: We request survey data for all TES, MIS and sensitive plants be included in the DEIS. Please include the dates of when surveys were conducted, where they were conducted and the results of said surveys. Response: Due to the urgent necessity to address threats to public safety, there will not be adequate time to conduct wildlife surveys before project implementation. The wildlife analysis will be based on existing data in Forest and State of California wildlife databases. These databases include survey results from Forest Service land and adjacent private lands. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 51.CC Comment: The scoping notice states the areas logged will be replanted using a species composition consistent with historic conditions. We simply remind the FS that would be mixed conifer and not predominantly Ponderosa pine -which is not utilized much by NSO. We have also seen the FS propose conversion of mixed conifer forest to Ponderosa pine in designated critical habitat for the NSO. While this makes no sense and fails to comply with owl recovery the Forest continues to do it. Response: Areas treated that are lacking sufficient forest cover will be replanted to historic conditions. Ponderosa pine is a component of a mixed conifer forest, especially within this project area. Ponderosa pine will be a component of the species mix, which will also include Douglas-fir and minor amounts of incense cedar, white fir and red fir (geographically dependent). Following fire, shade intolerant species such has ponderosa pine have a higher likelihood of survival than shade tolerant (i.e. white fir, incense cedar) or intermediate shade tolerant (i.e. Douglas-fir, sugar pine, red fir) conifer species. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action 52.CC Comment: Finally, we request the FS take the requisite "hard look" at cumulative effects. The FS has chosen a very large project area so that analysis may take some time. We don't consider a paragraph stating the current condition suffices as documenting cumulative effects, and neither does NEPA. Response: Each impacted resource is analyzed in Chapter 3 of the EIS, including cumulative effects where they exist. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage 53.CC Comment: We hope these comments are helpful in conducting the appropriate analyses for this project. Please keep us on the mailing list and notify us immediately of release of the DEIS as we will want to provide additional comments at that time. Response: The commenters have been added to the project mailing list and will be informed of any opportunities to comment as the project planning proceeds. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 54.WNI Comment: This project proposes to harvest trees, live or dead, along 233 miles of roads in areas affected by several wildfires that burned in 2015. The majority of acreage to be harvested occurs along Level 2 roads, which are accessible only with high-clearance vehicles. While the Forest Service's scoping letter considers the standing dead trees to be "hazards" to public safety, the reality is that these dead and dying trees constitute Complex Early Seral Forest habitat (DellaSalla et al. 2014)-habitat that is not only natural but critically important to the health of most western forest ecosystems including the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, and the Project will harm the many species that thrive within this habitat. Response: The proposed action only includes treatment of dead trees. Dying trees (trees with remaining green foliage) would be retained under the proposed action. Removal of dying trees will be considered under alternatives 2 & 3. Dead and dying trees in forest ecosystems near roads open to the public are both hazards to public safety and also a habitat component beneficial to many wildlife species. Project design features and resource protection measures are being developed to minimize potential effects to wildlife habitat suitability while still meeting the purpose and need of the project related to public safety. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 55.WNI Comment: The Project area also includes late-successional reserves and designated Critical Habitat for the declining and federally listed northern spotted owl. I urge the Shasta-Trinity to consider wildfires as restorative for the many species that depend upon complex early seral forests for their life history, including potential foraging habitat for spotted owls, and not simply as safety hazards that must be cleared away and re-planted. A thorough analysis of the Project's impacts must disclose all the myriad adverse effects on biological diversity that would result from removing this habitat. Response: The roads that were selected for treatment in the proposed action are roads that are open to the public. Some of those roads are Maintenance Level 2 roads (maintained to a level that allows use by high clearance vehicles). These Maintenance Level 2 roads receive varying degrees of use, with some being used frequently. However, any roads open to the public must be maintained at a safe operating level, which includes treatment of hazardous trees and snags that may fall on the roadbed. The impacts of each alternative on biological diversity will be addressed in the botany, wildlife and fish analyses in chapter 3 of the EIS. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 56.WNI Comment: I am a wildlife biologist and principal scientist with the Wild Nature Institute, a nonprofit scientific research and advocacy organization. I have a Bachelor's degree in Biology from Duke University and a Master's degree in Wildlife Science from the Oregon State University. Over the past 15 years, my colleagues and I have conducted and published numerous peerDraft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage reviewed studies examining occupancy rates, habitat selection, space use, and diet of California spotted owls in post-fire landscapes of the Sierra Nevada. In fact, I have published more scientific papers on ecological relationships between spotted owls and forest fire than any other scientist in the world, and these studies have been based on real data from real spotted owls in real fires, not on predictive modeling or simulations. Furthermore, the studies I have published regarding fire effects on spotted owl breeding site occupancy have the largest sample sizes of owl sites of any studies of their kind, and have been published in highly respected peer-reviewed journals.

While the California spotted owl is a different subspecies from the northern spotted owl, the two subspecies have generally similar life histories, diets, and habitat requirements. Moreover, fire regimes in northwestern California where the northern spotted owl resides are comparable to fire regimes in the Sierra Nevada where the California spotted owl resides. Little has been published in the peer-reviewed literature about the effects of fire on the northern spotted owl. Thus the current published literature, including my own on California spotted owls, constitutes the best available science for analyzing impacts on northern spotted owls. I will discuss and provide my own scientific studies about California spotted owls as well as the few studies published on fire effects to northern spotted owls and Mexican spotted owls. It is my great hope that the Shasta-Trinity National Forest will utilize these scientific studies on fire and salvage logging to better inform your post-fire management decisions, and to fully disclose how these decisions will impact a spotted owl population that is continuing to decline. Response: Thank you for your offer to provide scientific papers regarding effects of wildfire and post-fire management activities on California spotted owls. We may contact you for your assistance if we are unable to obtain some of the scientific papers you cited in your comments. The scientific literature relevant to the project analysis will be considered in the Biological Assessment. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage 57.WNI Comment: Furthermore, I would recommend the Forest Service conduct a complete analysis of how post-fire logging would impact all the many bird species that utilize burned forest at some point in their life history. I provide you with two documents that will be helpful in your analysis: 1)Hanson 2014; Conservation concerns for Sierra Nevada birds associated with high-severity fire, Western Birds 45:204-212 and (2) Hutto, RL, Bond ML, DellaSala, DA 2015. Using bird ecology to learn about the benefits of severe fire. Pages 89-117 in The Ecological Importance of Mixed-Severity Fires: Nature's Phoenix. Elsevier Press, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Response: Project impacts to at-risk species, including the northern goshawk, peregrine falcon, bald eagle, northern spotted owl, and other bird species, will be analyzed in the wildlife reports. Impacts to potential northern spotted owl post-fire foraging habitat will be included in the analysis. The analysis of the potential project impacts will be based on the available scientific data and pertinent scientific literature. The scientific literature relevant to the project analysis will be considered in the Wildlife Biological Assessment (for threatened and endangered species), Wildlife Biological Evaluation (for Forest Service Species), and other relevant wildlife reports. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 58.WNI Comment: Fire and Spotted Owls-A decade ago, it was understandable that the U.S. Forest Service would presume that post-fire logging would not harm spotted owls. Early studies on spotted owl habitat relations and correlations to reproductive success were conducted in unburned areas where the 'non-suitable' owl habitat was typically a result of logging rather than fire. As spotted owls are usually associated with older, dense forests, it was assumed that the effects of higher-severity wildfires were similar to logged clearcuts, resulting in a total loss of owl habitat. Fire, however, is a fundamentally different type of disturbance than logging. Enough research has now been conducted disproving the assumption that post-fire logging of dense forests burned at high intensity will not harm spotted owls. While high-intensity fire likely reduces habitat suitability for nesting and roosting because it lowers canopy cover, two studies found that spotted owls utilize and show a preference for intensely burned forests for foraging when the burned stands occurred close to the nest and core roost sites (Clark 2007 [Figure 6.2], Bond et al. 2009). These studies have been available to the U.S. Forest Service for years, yet the agency continues to propose harmful post-fire logging in spotted owl potentially suitable foraging habitat for spotted owls. I strongly oppose the Proposed Action and urge the Shasta-Trinity National Forest to refrain from logging any burned trees that are not a direct hazard to humans (e.g., leaning trees directly adjacent to well-traveled roads). Response: The roads that were selected for treatment in the proposed action are roads that are open to the public. Some of those roads are Maintenance Level 2 roads (maintained to a level that allows use by high clearance vehicles). These Maintenance Level 2 roads receive varying degrees of use, with some being used frequently. However, any roads open to the public must be maintained at a safe operating level, which includes treatment of hazardous trees and snags that may fall on the roadbed. Resource protection measures are being developed to protect northern spotted owl habitat, including post fire foraging habitat. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue. Issue Statement: Treatments may remove habitat that northern spotted owls use for foraging; therefore, include an alternative that does not impact habitat that could be used for post-fire foraging. 59.WNI Comment: I co-authored a study (Bond et al. 2009) that quantified habitat selection in forests that recently experienced significant amounts of moderate-and high-severity fire. Habitat Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage selection estimates how much owls used forest that burned at a particular severity compared with the availability of that burn severity. We radio-tracked seven California spotted owls occupying the McNally Fire in the Sequoia National Forest throughout the breeding season four years after fire. Very little (< 3 percent) of the combined foraging ranges of these owls was post-fire logged, so there were essentially no confounding effects of logging with high-intensity fire. Furthermore, all owls had unburned, low, moderate, and highly burned patches of forest in their foraging ranges from which to choose, so we could quantify whether owls selected or avoided any of these burn intensities. This was the first study to specifically examine foraging habitat selection by spotted owls in burned forests, and it is particularly important that these forests had not been subjected to substantial post-fire logging so we could assess the owls' preference or avoidance for forests burned at varying intensities. Spotted owls used all burn severities for foraging, but the probability of an owl using a site for foraging was strongest in severely burned forests, after accounting for distance from nest. Spotted owls used unburned mature/old forest for foraging less than would be expected based upon availability, where post-fire habitat was available for foraging. We also measured vegetation within owl foraging ranges and found that high-intensity burned sites had the greatest herb and shrub cover and basal area of snags. This result suggests that snags, herb, and shrub cover are important components of a post-fire forest that supports foraging habitat for spotted owls. We documented that when it is available to them, foraging owls appear to select high-severity burned forests not subjected to significant post-fire logging. Possible explanations for the selection of intensely burned forests for foraging may be increased accessibility or abundance of prey with fire-caused growth in shrubs and forbs. Spotted owls are perch-and-pounce predators, and thus must have an adequate supply of trees (such as snags) upon which to perch and wait for prey. Because intensely burned, non-salvage-logged forests can offer suitable habitat for foraging spotted owls, Bond et al. (2009) recommended "that burned forests within 1.5 km of nests or roosts of California spotted owls not be salvage-logged until long-term effects of fire on spotted owls and their prey are understood more fully." Also using radio-telemetry, Clark (2007) found similar selection by northern spotted owls for mature/old forest areas that burned at high-severity fire and were not subsequently salvage logged (see, e.g., Figure 6.2of Clark 2007). Many California spotted owl sites have continued to be occupied and reproductively successful after fires burned portions of their home ranges, including portions of the core area, at least over a moderate time scale (1 year post-fire [Bond et al. 2002, Lee and Bond 2015a], from 5 to 7 years after fire [Lee et al. 2012], and up to 16 years post-fire [Roberts et al. 2011]). After accounting for effects of fire on occupancy, amount of severe fire had no effect on reproduction of California spotted owls in southern California (Lee and Bond 2015b). Other research indicates that the structural legacies created by high-intensity fire provide benefits to spotted owls for much longer periods of time post-fire. For example, North et al. (1999) noted in a study of foraging habitat selection by northern spotted owls, "In our study area, stands with high use by owls typically included many 'legacies' (large trees and snags) that survived a fire or windstorm that destroyed much of the previous stand. The survival of just a few dominant and co-dominant trees from the original old-growth stand increased structural heterogeneity and produced more height class diversity in the regenerating stands." The authors went on to note: "Large snags were created when tree tops were snapped in early-century windstorms or rot-resistant tree species were killed by fire. The carry-over of these large structures into the regenerating stands may have produced sufficient foraging habitat for the owl even though other attributes of the stand were typical of younger forests." In a large-scale occupancy study in managed forests throughout the Sierra Nevada, of which I am also a co-author (Lee et al. 2012), we examined 11 years of U.S. Forest Service breeding-season survey data from 41 California spotted owl sites burned in 6 forest fires and 145 sites in long-unburned areas. This represented all available data for fires in spotted owl habitat where pre-fire and post-fire occupancy data had been gathered, during that time period and remains the largest and most comprehensive study of its kind ever published. We found no significant effects of fire on probabilities of local extinction Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage and colonization at burned versus unburned sites over the period of study (2001-2007), after accounting for annual and site-specific variation in detectability. Mean occupancy was actually slightly higher at burned sites (80 percent) than in unburned forest (76 percent), but the difference was not statistically significant. Post-fire logging occurred on 8 of the 41 burned sites; 7 of the 8 sites were occupied immediately after the fire but none were occupied after post-fire logging, suggesting salvage logging adversely impacted occupancy rates of the burned sites. Fire has affected proportionately more spotted owl sites in the San Bernardino National Forest of southern California than any other national forest in the range of the subspecies. This region is at the edge of the subspecies' range, and is subject to widespread high-intensity fire resulting from extreme fire weather in Santa Ana winds. Using occupancy survey data from 2003 to 2011 for all-detections and pairs-only data, another study I co-authored (Lee et al. 2013) estimated annual extinction and colonization probabilities at 71 burned and 97 long-unburned breeding-season sites before and after fire, while controlling for confounding effects of non-fire-related temporal variation and among-site differences in habitat characteristics. We found no statistically significant effects of fire on occupancy dynamics in this population, although we did find potential biologically significant adverse effects on occupancy when extremely large areas within owl core areas were burned by high-severity fire. However, a further analysis of the data (Lee and Bond 2015b) indicated that only sites that were marginal, lower-quality, and less productive showed lower occupancy-the highly productive sites remained occupied and reproductive regardless of amount of high-severity fire in the core area. Furthermore, Lee et al. 2013 found post-fire salvage logging further reduced occupancy of sites. In mostly mixed-conifer forests of the western Sierra Nevada, my colleague and I published a study using U.S. Forest Service survey data that found high California spotted owl occupancy at one year post-fire (before post-fire logging) in the 257,314-acre Rim Fire of 2013 on the Stanislaus National Forest (Lee and Bond 2015a). One-year post-fire occupancy probability of historical territories (territories occupied in one or more years over the past two decades or so) was 92 percent. We also found that, in these post-fire territories of the Rim Fire which had not yet been subjected to post-fire logging, pair occupancy was not lower in territories with mostly high-intensity fire effects (occupancy in such territories was still over 90 percent). Similar results have been documented in other subspecies of spotted owl. Jenness et al. (2004) published a peer-reviewed paper examining pre-and post-fire occupancy and reproduction of a sample of 64 Mexican spotted owl sites in mixed-conifer, pine, and pine-oak forests in four national forests in New Mexico and Arizona. The authors selected owl sites in fires that burned from 1993-1996, and compared levels of occupancy [single, pair, failed reproduction, successful reproduction] in 33 burned and 31 unburned sites, including 29 paired burned and unburned sites within 12 km of each other, in 1997. Post-fire occupancy rates were not significantly different between burned and unburned sites, and did not statistically differ with time since fire. The percent of high-intensity fire in a burned territory had no significant influence on whether the site was occupied. Post-fire logging was relatively minor in most of the fires (Coronado and Gila national forests, personal communication with M. Bond). A recent study by Ganey et al. (2014) showed radio-marked Mexican spotted owls traveled considerable distances to utilize burned habitat during the winter, likely because of greater prey biomass in the burned wintering area as compared to the nest core area. Clark et al. (2013) examined how post-fire logging affected occupancy dynamics of northern spotted owls in the Timbered Rock Fire and an unburned area in southwestern Oregon. They found colonization probabilities declined over time at both burned and unburned sites, but extinction probabilities were greater after post-fire logging. Clark et al. (2013), on p. 15, concluded the following: Our results also indicated a negative impact of salvage logging on site occupancy by spotted owls. We recommend restricting salvage logging after fires on public lands within 2.2 km of spotted owl territories (the median home range size in this portion of the spotted owl's range) to limit the negative impacts of salvage logging. Only one study has examined the effects of fire on survival rates of marked spotted owls in the absence of post-fire logging, also co-authored by me (Bond et al. 2002). We found no effect Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage of fire on short-term (1 year) survival. We examined short-term post-fire survival of 21 banded spotted owls in 4 demography study areas encompassing all 3 subspecies. Our field biologists re-sighted bands and determined reproductive status of owls before and after fire in mixed-conifer and mixed-evergreen forests of northwestern California (similar to the Shasta-Trinity), the San Bernardino Mountains of southern California, the Tularosa Mountains of New Mexico, and in pine-oak forests on the Coconino Plateau in Arizona. All nest and roost areas were burned, and no post-fire logging had occurred before owls were surveyed the year after fire. We found that survival rates were the same in burned and unburned territories. All pairs were faithful to their pre-fire territory and mate. Post-fire logging such as that proposed in the Trinity Project is harming spotted owls, and spotted owls are declining partly as a result of such logging based upon the best available scientific evidence: * Lee et al. (2012) studied 6 representative fires, covering 11 years of breeding season data, and spanning the southern Sierra Nevada to the northern Sierra Nevada. We reported that mixed-severity fire, averaging 32 percent high-severity fire effects in a 400-ha core area around nests or roost sites, did not reduce occupancy of California spotted owls in the Sierra Nevada and, in fact, occupancy in mixed-severity fire areas was slightly higher than in unburned mature forest, and even territories with > 50 percent high-severity fire remained occupied (at levels of occupancy comparable to unburned forests). This, however, was not the case in post-fire logged sites, as every site that was salvage logged lost occupancy, even though they were occupied after the fire but before the salvage logging. Specifically, post-fire logging occurred on at least 8 of the 41 burned sites; 7 of the 8 sites were occupied immediately after the fire but none were occupied after post-fire logging. * In the Moonlight fire of 2007 on the Plumas National Forest, while a larger number of spotted owl 300acre Protected Activity Centers (PACs) remained in the system due to historical occupancy, at the time of the Moonlight Fire there were only 9 California spotted owl sites occupied by pairs (much of the area had been logged in previous years/decades), based upon occupancy data provided by the Plumas National Forest. All 9 sites lost occupancy by the pairs following extensive post-fire logging on adjacent private timberlands (and, later, on national forest lands), which began in the summer of 2007, just days and weeks after the fire occurred, indicating that post-fire logging, not fire, was the cause of lost occupancy (DellaSala et al. 2010). This demonstrates that PACs alone are not sufficient to sustain spotted owls (which have home ranges many times larger than mere ~120 ha PACs). This is broadly consistent with the findings of Clark et al. (2013), who found that post-fire salvage logging in high-severity fire areas significantly increased territory extinction of northern spotted owls in southwestern Oregon. The available scientific data indicate that post-fire logging on both public and private lands is a major threat to spotted owl occupancy and populations. * Bond et al. (2009) quantified habitat selection, which is how much owls used forest that burned at a particular severity compared with the availability of that burn severity. The probability of an owl using a site for foraging was significantly greater in burned-especially severely burned-forests than unburned forest. Bond et al. (2009) also measured vegetation and found that high-intensity burned sites had the greatest herb and shrub cover and basal area of snags. This result suggests that snags, herb, and shrub cover are important components of a post-fire forest that supports foraging habitat for spotted owls, as these features provide excellent habitat for the owl's small mammal prey base. * With regards to foraging habitat selection, Clark (2007) states on page 100 of his M.S. thesis: …[all owls were] 2.33 times more likely (95% CI = 1.75-3.09, p < 0.0001) to use NRF habitat with high severity burn than early-seral forests. NRF habitats with moderate and high severity burn and RF with moderate severity burns were selected and used more frequently than available, but overall use of these habitats was relatively low." Salvage logged sites were used less frequently than available, and in the same fashion as early seral forest stands. For just owls within the perimeter of the burn, "NRF habitats of any fire severity were selected, with low/unburned stands being 3.23 times…, moderate severity stands being 4.48 times…, and high severity stands being 3.58 times more likely used than early seral habitat." (Clark 2007, page 103). The owls also used salvage logged areas, but only where Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage associated with riparian buffers and patches of leave trees, and some locations were from the logged areas prior to or during timber harvest (although number of these locations was unknown. "Areas that received clear-cut salvage were rarely used." (Clark 2007, page 103, emphasis added). It is true that Clark's radio-tagged Northern Spotted Owls preferred old, structurally diverse forest as foraging habitat, but they also preferred severely burned forest (i.e., used it more than it was available)-a point that cannot be discounted by the Forest Service during analysis of effects of removing this foraging habitat. These severely burned patches were rare within owl home ranges in the study, yet were used more frequently than available. Clark (2007) specifically stated: "[w]hile, these areas of stand replacement may not provide high quality habitat, they likely provided some benefit to owls following wildfire because owls did make use of these stands. I hypothesize that high severity burns in NRF habitat which created early seral stands may be used by owls because they may provide increased prey abundance…but I was unable to test this hypothesis. Furthermore, large dead trees created by wildfire are likely to serve as "legacy structures", and provide coarse woody debris and snags for future late-successional forests…, potentially making these stands important to creation of spotted owl habitat in the future. In addition, early seral forests created by disturbance events that are not altered by timber harvest are extremely rare…and support some of the highest levels of biodiversity…Therefore, the potential ecological benefits of large standing dead trees should be weighed against social and economic objectives when considering land management activities." (Clark 2007, page 115). Response: The scientific literature includes a wide range of findings on northern spotted owls and their use of burned areas, and some authors have proposed management recommendations in addition to reporting research results. The wildlife biological assessment will consider the relevant scientific studies and associated recommendations in assessing potential effects of proposed activities on northern spotted owls and formulating resource protection measures related to this species. The analysis will include consideration of impacts on northern spotted owl habitat, including post fire foraging habitat. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 60.WNI Comment: The Shasta-Trinity's NEPA analysis must discuss cumulative effects incorporating private lands that have been heavily logged in the distant and recent past, and amount of post-fire logging on these lands, and how this might affect the potential for northern spotted owl recovery. Please also include a discussion of the published literature quantifying actual fire rotation in forests occupied by northern spotted owl forests, as the scoping letter suggests the purpose and need is to prevent future severe fire in the region. Such literature includes: Odion, DC, Hanson CT, DellaSala DA, Baker WL, Bond ML 2014. Effects of fire and commercial thinning on future habitat of the Northern Spotted Owl. Open Journal of Ecology 7:37-51. Response: The purpose of the project is to reduce hazards along roads, including heavy fuel loading, to provide for public and firefighter safety using the roads; it is not to prevent future severe fire in the region as stated in the comment. The proposed action consists of a very narrow buffer along roads; this narrow buffer is unlikely to affect fire behavior across the landscape, but is designed to reduce fire intensity along the roads. The assessment of potential effects of this project, including impacts to northern spotted owls, will include an analysis of cumulative effects, which is necessary under both NEPA and ESA. Future Foreseeable treatments on adjacent private lands will be considered in the analysis to the extent that it is available on the CalFire private timber harvest database. Salvage harvest on private lands is considered a present/ongoing action and is estimated within the relevant resource reports. The fire regime in this area will also be addressed in the project analysis, and the scientific study listed in the comment will be reviewed. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage 61.WNI Comment: There has been a documented continued decline of northern spotted owls (Forsman et al. 2011). The decline of the owls and its underlying cause of green-forest logging must be discussed in the forthcoming Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) if the Shasta-Trinity National Forest elects to proceed with this Project. The EIS must also discuss and analyze all the relevant scientific literature I have provided in this letter. Response: The wildlife biological assessment will analyze the potential effects of proposed project activities on northern spotted owls. Green-forest logging is not included in the proposed action. Scientific literature pertinent to the proposed activities will be reviewed and incorporated into the project design and analysis processes. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 62.WNI Comment: I strongly disagree with any post-fire logging of burned trees on national forest lands that are not directly threatening busy thoroughfares, as these trees provide critical habitat for many native species (DellaSalla et al. 2014). Response: A range of alternatives will be developed and analyzed in the project EIS. This will include a No Action alternative, which would involve no tree removal or any other activities. The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. Closed roads would not be treated under the proposed action. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #1. Issue Statement: Treatments may remove habitat that is crucial to native species; therefore, include an alternative that does not include post-fire logging where it's not directly impacting busy roads. 63.WNI Comment: At the very minimum I recommend the following, based on the best available science: (1) Conduct comprehensive, protocol-level occupancy surveys of every historical spotted owl territory. This includes at least 6 visits in each site if conducted over one year. Better yet, conduct surveys for at least 2 or more years following the fire before any logging is conducted, as unoccupied sites can become colonized (Lee et al. 2012); Response: Due to the urgent need to address hazards to public safety, there will not be adequate time or opportunity to conduct protocol surveys for northern spotted owls on this very large scale. Analysis of potential effects will be based on the extensive existing data in Forest and State of California wildlife databases. The analysis will address northern spotted owl home range locations, current habitat levels for northern spotted owls, and effects of project activities on the suitability of these habitats for northern spotted owls. Suitable northern spotted owl habitat will be assumed to be occupied. Consultation will occur with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to comply with the Endangered Species Act. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 64.WNI Comment: (2) Properly classify and quantify suitable owl habitat, including mature and old forest with many perch trees that has burned at high intensity as suitable foraging habitat (Bond et al. 2009); Response: The wildlife analysis for this project will include an updated assessment of habitat suitability for northern spotted owls in the project area. This assessment will include an analysis Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage of the use of burned areas by this species, and will be developed in coordination with the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 65.WNI Comment: (3) Specifically quantify and describe to the public how much burned forest will be removed and where it is located in relation to owl territories and designated Critical Habitat; Response: The wildlife analysis in chapter 3 of the EIS will assess the effects of each alternative on northern spotted owls and will consider impacts on habitat suitability and designated critical habitat.  . The wildlife Biological Assessment will also analyze these impacts for the preferred alternative, and consultation with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will occur. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 66.WNI Comment: (4) Do not conduct any logging within 1,500 meters of known spotted owl core areas (Bond et al. 2009), whether occupied or not (because unoccupied sites can be later colonized, Lee et al. 2012) with the exception of true public hazards along busy, well-traveled roads; Response: The scientific literature on northern spotted owl use of burned areas and potential effects of management activities includes a number of management recommendations. These recommendations and the research results they are based on will be reviewed, and their pertinence to the proposed project activities will be assessed. The No Action alternative, which would include no logging within 1500 meters of NSO cores, will be analyzed and included in the project EIS. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #1. Issue Statement: Treatments may remove habitat that is crucial to northern spotted owls; therefore, include an alternative that does not include post-fire logging where it's not directly impacting busy roads. 67.WNI Comment: (5) Notwithstanding Recommendation 4, I urge the U.S. Forest Service to not log any suitable owl nesting, roosting, or foraging habitat (this includes burned forest) given the natural territory-shifting that may occur after fire, and given that the Mexican spotted owl study showed owls will move to new burned areas away from their nest cores to take advantage of greater prey biomass. A no-logging alternative should be thoroughly analyzed in the forthcoming EIS using the best available scientific data. Response: The wildlife biological assessment will address the potential for northern spotted owls to shift behavior patterns in response to fire effects. The No Action alternative, which includes no logging or any other activities, will be analyzed along with all other project alternatives. Limits to logging activities will also be considered in the project design process for other project alternatives. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #1. Issue Statement: Treatments may remove habitat that is crucial to northern spotted owls; therefore, include an alternative that does not include post-fire logging where it's not directly impacting busy roads. Alternative driving issue #4: The project could have a negative impact on northern spotted owl habitat; therefore, an alternative should be considered that minimizes or eliminates impacts to northern spotted owls. 68.WNI Comment: Thank you again for the opportunity to provide comments. This is a time for extreme caution with regard to management of habitat for this imperiled subspecies. I hope the ShastaDraft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Trinity National Forest will consider these comments, and recognize the importance of burned-forest habitat not only for spotted owls, but for woodpeckers and many other fire-following plants and animals. Response: Impacts to wildlife, water and forest resources are considered in the effects analysis, vary between alternatives, and are minimized to the extent practicable in the Resource Protection Measures. High priority areas have been identified as occurring along roads open to the public. Burned-forest as wildlife and plant habitat is considered in the wildlife and botany effects analyses in Chapter 3 of the EIS. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 69.CBF Comment: In response to the scoping notice for the above project, we endorse and include by reference the comments from the Trinity Collaborative Forestry Sub-committee. Please keep us informed of the progress made on this project. Response: We appreciate your interest in management of public lands. We will keep you informed of project progress, including informing you of future comment opportunities. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 70.CFA Comment: 1) CFA believes the Forest should consider a variable width buffer for dead and dying tree removal along existing roads. On steeper sideslopes above the road, often the width should be 1 ½ to 2 tree lengths to assure a falling tree does not fall and a portion of the tree break off and slide to the road. On the downhill side of the road, the buffer width should be 1 tree length so that no part of a falling tree can hit the road. Response: Hazard trees along haul routes and treatment units would be felled during implementation, but those that are felled outside of treatment buffers would be left onsite. The treatment in the proposed action only includes a variable buffer up to 300 feet in width. An alternative to the proposed action is being developed that would have a wider buffer width, consistent with the Hazard Tree Guidelines for Forest Service Facilities and Roads in the Pacific Southwest Region (Angwin et al. 2012). Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #6. Issue Statement: The proposed action does not fully address the hazard tree conditions; therefore, an alternative should be considered that allows a wider treatment buffer where necessary to address the hazard. 71.CFA Comment: 2) CFA is surprised there's no discussion in the description of the proposed action of what will be done where the road passes through an area occupied by spotted owl(s). Response: Potential changes in project design in areas occupied by northern spotted owls are considered as part of developing Resource Protection Measures. The Forest Service has collaborated with the US Fish and Wildlife Service regarding appropriate levels of protection that will also allow us to meet the project's purpose and need, which includes reducing safety hazards along roads open to public traffic. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 72.Dodson, Anastasia Comment: 1.) The project must state that there will be no timber harvest in Wilderness areas or in Designated Roadless areas. Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Response: The proposed action states that there are no proposed treatments in wilderness. This project, however, does treat along roads open for public use (National Forest System roads with a maintenance level of 2, 3, or 4, as well as county and state roads). Some of these open roads occur in Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRA). These roads will be treated, consistent with the purpose and need of the project, but will have additional resource protection measures (i.e. limited mechanical treatments outside of road prism) in place to maintain the existing integrity of the IRA. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action (no treatment in wilderness). Alternative driving issue #5(no treatment in IRA). Issue Statement: Treatments in Inventoried Roadless Areas would affect the natural environment and could have a negative impact on TES species; therefore, include an alternative that does not treat in IRAs. 73.Dodson, Anastasia Comment: 2.) I understand the Project proposes to reduce downed logs greater than 3" in diameter to 10-20 tons/acre and reduce dead brush by 50-100%. Would this happen in a minimum or maximum corridor of 300 feet along roads? Or, would this happen within all severely burned areas also? Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. The proposed action does not include treatment of areas outside of the roadside buffer (maximum 300-feet total width). The proposed action would only treat dead trees. Healthy and dying green trees would not be treated under the proposed action. Other alternatives are analyzed that include removal of fire-injured trees with a high probability of mortality, Issue Disposition: Asks a question that can be answered succinctly in the analysis or response to comments. 74.Dodson, Anastasia Comment: Removing dead or hazardous trees in a corridor along roads would add to fire resilience as well as provide for safety to people. It would seem important to do this as soon as possible while protecting resources. Is this the aspect that needs an Emergency Situation Determination? Response: An Emergency Situation Determination was considered earlier in the planning process but is not being pursued at this time. Issue Disposition: Asks a question that can be answered succinctly in the analysis or response to comments. 75.Dodson, Anastasia Comment: 3.) The project indicates timber sale along 128 miles of road. What does that mean? Green trees? Black trees? What is Salvage? Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. The proposed action does not include treatment of areas outside of the roadside buffer (maximum 300-feet total width). The proposed action would only treat dead trees. Healthy and dying green trees would not be treated under the proposed action. Salvage refers to the sale of trees where they are dead and/or dying in large areas, usually due to fire, insect or disease, but also sometimes weather events can create large pockets of dead and broken Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage trees. Where dead trees are in sufficient quantity and quality to provide commercial value along roads in the project area, they would be sold in a salvage timber sale. Issue Disposition: Asks a question that can be answered succinctly in the analysis or response to comments. 76.Dodson, Anastasia Comment: 4.) I also recommend including fuelbreaks in the project. Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. For a fuelbreak to be effective at reducing fire behavior, it must be contiguous, wider than the treatments proposed in the proposed action, and strategically located (not all roads are in areas that would be strategic for fuelbreaks). The nature of the fire impact is spotty, meaning that many areas along the roads in the project area burned at very low severity. To create an effective fuelbreak would require treatment of green vegetation in these low severity areas; the proposed action would only treat dead vegetation. Fuelbreak creation and maintenance will be considered in alternatives. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #7. Issue Statement: Future high severity fire is a concern in the project area which will not be addressed by the proposed action; therefore, analyze an alternative that includes effective fuelbreaks. 77.Dodson, Anastasia Comment: 5.) Hazard reduction/removal and reducing surface fuels are the most important steps. These should done with an economic return to communities in a timely manner. Response: The purpose and need state includes the following statement, "Within the treated areas, capture the economic value of felled trees and support the economies of local communities by providing forest products." It is a priority of the project to accomplish this. To plan a project of this size, complexity, and with this level of impacts is time consuming. The Forest Service is pursuing options to reduce the amount of time that it takes to complete this level of analysis. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 78.Dodson, Anastasia Comment: 6. In addition to safety and fire resilience, please consider waterbars and other measures necessary for water quality, as a result of fire suppression activities, in case they were not addressed before the current winter 2015-16. These will be important for years because of potential erosion in the burned areas, whether they are planted soon or not. Water quality is critical for the health of all aspects of the forests, including timber production. Response: Fire suppression repair and Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) efforts have addressed some of these issues directly, by repairing some of the suppression impacts, including installing water bars, and making improvements to the road system in the burned area. The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. Additional repair of fire and suppression damage within the fire boundary but away from roads is beyond the scope of this project; however, resource protection measures and Best Management Practices designed to protect water quality will be required within the area treated in the project. Additional mitigations in the watersheds that were most impacted by fire are also being considered as part of the mitigation measures. Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project (repairing fire suppression damage). Consistent with the proposed action (implementation of protection measures to protect water quality). 79.STVFD Comment: 1) Fuelbreak width: recommend widen to 500' in saddles (chimneys). This has been standard operating procedures for many years in Southern California and these topographical chimneys are where people have been hurt or killed. Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. For a fuelbreak to be effective at reducing fire behavior, it must be contiguous, wider than the treatments proposed in the proposed action, and strategically located (not all roads are in areas that would be strategic for fuelbreaks). The nature of the fire impact is spotty, meaning that many areas along the roads in the project area burned at very low severity. To create an effective fuelbreak would require treatment of green vegetation in these low severity areas; the proposed action would only treat dead vegetation. Fuelbreak creation and maintenance will be considered in alternatives. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #7. Issue Statement: Future high severity fire is a concern in the project area which will not be addressed by the proposed action; therefore, analyze an alternative that includes effective fuelbreaks. 80.STVFD Comment: 2) Fuelbreak Maintenance: yes, fuelbreaks require maintenance, arbitrarily at approximately 10-year intervals. Opening of the crown cover will encourage regeneration and require handwork to keep clear -good job for inmate labor. Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. For a fuelbreak to be effective at reducing fire behavior, it must be contiguous, wider than the treatments proposed in the proposed action, and strategically located (not all roads are in areas that would be strategic for fuelbreaks).

To create a fuelbreak would require treatment of green vegetation in these low severity areas; the proposed action would only treat dead vegetation. Fuelbreak creation and maintenance will be considered in alternatives. Also, the treatments in the proposed action would have maintenance, as described on page four of the scoping document. Maintenance timeframes were not explicitly detailed in the scoping package, but will occur within 15 years following implementation (see Chapter 2 for more information on maintenance). The NEPA analysis does not prescribe particular labor sources in order to allow flexibility in implementation when other labor options are more available and/or efficient. Roadside fuelbreaks will be considered under alternatives to the proposed action. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #7.

Not to worry about "monoculture" other native timber species will come in naturally if within wind/rodent range and the ponderosa pine will serve as a nurse crop. Response: Reforestation prescriptions will be consistent with historic species composition (consistent with the National Forest Management Act of 1976). Therefore, ponderosa pine will be Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage in the mix of species planted, along with incense cedar, Douglas fir, white fir, red fir, and sugar pine. As planting will only occur in areas deforested due to fire mortality, species that thrive in the full sun will be favored in the planting mix. There are, however, areas where existing seed sources are substantially limited due to fire mortality, and would result in a monoculture if an appropriate species mix is not planted. Ponderosa pine thrives in full sun and is relatively fire resilient when mature thereby making it a valuable stand component in fire affected stands. See Response #105 regarding spacing. Issue Disposition: Already decided by law, regulation, or policy. 84.STVFD Comment: 6)Process: where reasonable a fuelbreak should include access suitable for type 3 4x4 fire engines which would work the break in the event of fire and have immediate access to the lee side safety, regardless of which direction the fire might approach from. Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. For a fuelbreak to be effective at reducing fire behavior, it must be contiguous, wider than the treatments proposed in the proposed action, and strategically located (not all roads are in areas that would be strategic for fuelbreaks). The nature of the fire impact is spotty, meaning that many areas along the road burned at very low severity. To create a fuelbreak would require treatment of green vegetation in these low severity areas; the proposed action would only treat dead vegetation. Roadside fuelbreaks will be considered under alternatives to the proposed action. Most portions of roads that are treated under this project will be accessible by type 3 4x4 fire engines. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #7. Issue Statement: Future high severity fire is a concern in the project area which will not be addressed by the proposed action; therefore, analyze an alternative that includes effective fuelbreaks. 85.STVFD Comment: 7) Erosion control: waterbar and out slope access 1-2% (0.5% was a "ditch grade") and seed exposed soils to grass (Timothy, Orchard grass, perennial rye and sweet clover or similar) which will also provide wildlife/livestock feed and can be quickly burned off if the fuelbreak is employed for suppression. Response: Erosion control is addressed in the Best Management Practices that will be required for the proposed action or selected alternative. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #7. Issue Statement: Future high severity fire is a concern in the project area which will not be addressed by the proposed action; therefore, analyze an alternative that includes effective fuelbreaks. 86.STVFD Comment: 8) Mid-slope fuelbreak: silvicultural treatment/thinning along roads below ridge top effect. While probably not truly fuelbreak, particularly on a steep slope, nonetheless thinning along such roads certainly contributes to greater traveler safety, especially in the escape mode, and can be effective for "flanking" a fire. Thinning should favor the downhill side as a fire spread is largely slope driven up hill. Response: The proposed action only proposes to treat dead vegetation where it poses a hazard to people using the roads, which is consistent with the purpose and need to reduce hazards along open roads. Thinning of green vegetation is not included in the proposed action. For a fuelbreak to be effective at reducing fire behavior, it must be contiguous, wider than the treatments Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage proposed in the proposed action, and strategically located (not all roads are in areas that would be strategic for fuelbreaks). The nature of the fire impact is spotty, meaning that many areas along the road burned at very low severity. To create a fuelbreak would require treatment of green vegetation in these low severity areas; the proposed action would only treat dead vegetation. Fuelbreak creation and maintenance will be considered in alternatives. An alternative is also being considered that includes a wider treatment on the downhill side of roads as a way to more effectively impact fire behavior along the roads. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #8. Issue Statement: The proposed action should do more to address traveler safety along roads; therefore, analyze an alternative that includes silvicultural treatments (including thinning green vegetation) downhill from treated roads. 87.STVFD Comment: Overview -This is more the 30 year ongoing "too little too late." A proposal to treat approximately 3.5% of the total burned area or 18% of severely burned area to be offered for sale by August 2016, a full year after fire occurrence, such area to be limited to roadside strips with no action to take place beyond the delineated 300 feet treatment area. Big Deal! Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. This project is not meant to be a landscape-level restoration project. Due to the number of acres affected by the fires, across multiple watersheds and land allocations, and through critical northern spotted owl habitat, an EIS is required for analysis prior to implementation.. Additional restoration treatments in the burned area may be considered in other projects. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 88.STVFD Comment: As a forester, (Bachelor of Science, University of Maine, 1956) I was trained that in the event of disaster such as fire, wind throw, or insect/disease epidemic the forester needs to move quickly and decisively to minimize damage, capture and utilize residual value, and maintain land productivity. Response: Removal of dead and dying trees immediately following fire impacts would capture much more of the economic value of fire-impacted trees. However, unlike logging on private lands, any planned activities on National Forest System lands must comply with federal laws and regulations such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA has specific requirements for analysis of impacts to resources that must be accomplished, along with solicitation of public input, for every action. During and following fire suppression, imminent hazard trees were felled which is consistent with actions categorically excluded from documentation. However, utilizing mechanical equipment such as skidders, road construction, etc. requires an appropriate level of analysis under NEPA, which in this case is an EIS. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 89.STVFD Comment: Specifically 1) as soon as the air is clear and safe, get grass seed on barren burned areas utilizing fixed wing or helicopter. Response: Seeding with grass seed is not standard practice in this area. The Forest is in a Mediterranean climate where most precipitation comes in the winter. Grass seed is unable to become established before the first heavy rains wash them into creeks. The grass seed germinates in and along creek beds, which causes an over-abundance of grass in these areas. The Burned Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Area Emergency Response (BAER) process evaluated all burned barren areas within the burned areas for erosion and values at risk (roads, private residents, endangered species, etc.) and concluded that mulching was not necessary to protect critical values at risk. The BAER process identified many roads that were in need of repair and they were treated with various types of storm proofing to reduce road-related erosion. Erosion control in the greater burned area is outside the scope of this project; however, erosion control measures will be implemented where necessary during project implementation. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project. 90.STVFD Comment: 3) as soon as suppression activities thin, commence salvage logging of dead and dying, start with cat and skidder along roadsides and moving quickly to yarder to be followed by helicopter and appropriate road construction the following season. Response: Removal of dead and dying trees immediately following fire impacts would capture much more of the economic value of fire-impacted trees. However, unlike logging on private lands, any planned activities on National Forest System lands must comply with federal laws and regulations such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA has specific requirements for analysis of impacts to resources that must be accomplished, along with solicitation of public input, for every action. During and following fire suppression, imminent hazard trees were felled which is consistent with actions categorically excluded from documentation. However, utilizing mechanical equipment such as skidders, road construction, etc. requires an appropriate level of analysis under NEPA, which in this case is an EIS. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project. 91.STVFD Comment: Some crowns may remain green but increment boring, sounding, or sample falling will verify "cambium cooked-tree dead". Don't know how to do this? Contact Roseburg Lumber Co -100,000 acres in two years and they even made a training film -"Fountain Fire". Response: The Forest recognizes that green needles do not indicate that a tree will survive and thrive. Cambial death does often take time for the needles to respond to lack of resources and turn brown. The Forest does have experience in determining the probability of mortality (as referenced in the comment regarding the Stafford Fire Salvage of 2013). If the proposed action were consistent with the Stafford Fire Salvage Project, the Forest would evaluate cambium injury under the direction of Marking guidelines for fire-injured trees in California (Smith and Cluck 2011). The proposed action includes removal of dead trees at time of implementation. At the time of implementation, most mortality directly due to cambium injury should be realized; however, additional mortality (primarily due to secondary agents such as insects exploiting weakened trees) is anticipated for a few more years. Utilizing the probability of mortality as directed in the Marking Guidelines for fire-injured trees in California may be considered under an alternative to the proposed action. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #11. Issue Statement: The proposed action only proposes to remove trees that are dead at the time of implementation, but this does not address all of the trees that will die from fire damage, which means the treatments do not fully address the hazard; analyze an alternative that would remove dying trees as well as dead trees. 92.STVFD Comment: 4) Logging done-start winter/spring planting 8x8 space-strong to PP but try some DF where shade available but not necessary along edges where other species will come in naturally. Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Response: Reforestation prescriptions will be consistent with historic species composition (consistent with the National Forest Management Act of 1976). Therefore, ponderosa pine will be in the mix of species planted, along with incense cedar, Douglas fir, white fir, red fir and sugar pine. As planting will only occur in areas deforested due to fire mortality, species that thrive in the full sun will be favored in the planting mix. There are, however, areas where existing seed sources are substantially limited due to fire mortality, and would result in a monoculture if an appropriate species mix is not planted. Ponderosa pine thrives in full sun and is relatively fire resilient when mature thereby making it a valuable stand component in fire affected stands. See Response #105 regarding spacing. Issue Disposition: Already decided by law, regulation, or policy 93.STVFD Comment: Can't get this done? Then turn the whole mess over to private industry such as Roseburg or SPI and there are some good consultants available such as Hancock. Admittedly, this would take legislative intervention which is highly unlikely post 2016 election makes public sentiment clear but it would be an excellent training exercise for a USFS that has been largely impotent and not cost effective for the last 20+ years. Does anyone remember the foundational direction of the 1897 Organic Act -"Produce wood and water on a sustained yield basis to help meet the needs of the American people"? Response: Forest Service lands are managed under the National Forest Management Act of 1976 as well as a multiple use mandate (Multiple Use and Sustained Yield Act of 1960). The lands must be managed for forestry/timber, recreation, wildlife habitat, range, and water resources. The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads; however, secondarily, the purpose and need also includes an aspect to produce timber products where hazard trees are abundant enough to create commercial opportunity. Planting is being proposed in treated areas appropriate for reforestation. Additional planting outside of treatment boundaries may be considered under a different project. The impacts of logging on federal lands must be considered in the context of impacts to resources in the analysis area. Reallocation of management for the Shasta-Trinity National Forest to private industry is outside the scope of this project and beyond the authority of the Responsible Official. Issue Disposition: Already decided by law, regulation, or policy 94.STVFD Comment: P1-last paragraph-good concise data on coming mortality and increasing bug activity east of South Fork Mountain Response: The interdisciplinary team utilizes RAVG data combined with field verification to determine existing conditions related to mortality. Monitoring of secondary mortality will continue, and consistency or departures from historic mortality modeling will be disclosed in the silviculture report. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 95.STVFD Comment: P3-last paragraph item 4 starting "create" disagree strongly. Fire was commonly by "native Americans" to keep the forest open for travel, the production of food stuffs, and probably harass competing tribes. "Natural fire" is probably indefinable but is attested to by signs such as large cat faces, bark charring as high as 15 feet and areas of discolored erosion pavement. The intent of modern forestry was to bring in silvicultural practices which access the forest while Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage redirecting fuel loads and respecting property boundaries, which did not exist 200 years ago-all in a fiscally responsible manner. Response: Within the last 100 years forest practices and fire suppression have created a large build-up of fuels on the forest floor. High severity wildfires add to the heavy fuel loading with dead and dying trees (becoming logs) and dead brush. This high fuel loading decreases firefighter safety and increases detrimental fire effects on the landscape. The project identifies a need to "Create conditions that will support the restoration of fire to its natural role in the ecosystem" because it is a primary "Forest Goal" identified in the Management Direction section of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan. While the exact extent and frequency of Native American ignitions remains unknown, it is clear from historic accounts that most tribes used fire for many reasons. Native American burning appears to have been most frequent in low-elevation oak woodlands, prairies in the coastal forest belt, and eastside ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forests (Sugihara et al. 1987). Aside from these generalities, it is not possible to separate the role of Native American ignitions from lightning sources over the last several thousand years. The most common belief is that while Native American ignitions were locally important, lightning was responsible for a large majority of historic fires and is sufficient to explain long-term fire regimes (Swetnam & Baisan 1996, Agee 1991b, Burke 1979). Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement. 96.STVFD Comment: P2-last paragraph-"purpose" can't anyone say silviculture anymore or is it not politically correct, specifically a major purpose for action should be the opportunity to apply scientific silviculture to help make/keep the forest healthy and productive. There was a time in the 60's and 70's when there was widespread pride within the USFS that aside from the five southern California "Fire Forests" the USFS was an asset to the American taxpayer. Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. A post-fire project with a silvicultural purpose and need would look considerably different than this proposal and focus on restoration of the landscape through strategic salvage and reforestation to effectively restore forest cover at the landscape scale. Given the scale of disturbance and existing capacity, this objective is not feasible to achieve in a timely manner, which is so critical when dealing with deteriorating trees. However, planting on a larger landscape scale may be considered as a separate project. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 97.STVFD Comment: P3-2nd paragraph item 6-starting "quickly" this should be #1 and be performed on a continuing basis to maintain forest health and mill capacity Response: The need statement Quickly recover the monetary value of wood through salvage and sale, where feasible and appropriate, to provide economic stimulus to local communities (Forest Plan 4-5) is a reference to Forest Plan direction, and is a driver for implementation of this project. However, this direction does not outweigh other resource protection direction outlined in the Forest Plan or the NEPA process. An EIS is required for this project because the project is likely to have significant impacts; timelines for EISs are dictated by law, regulation and policy, as well as necessary time to complete a robust analysis. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage 98.STVFD Comment: P3-last paragraph-treatment should widen to 500 feet in draws/chimneys and go wide on the down-hill side for the extreme reason of traveler safety-fire and heat naturally move upslope Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. For a fuelbreak to be effective at reducing fire behavior, it must be contiguous, wider than the treatments proposed in the proposed action, and strategically located (not all roads are in areas that would be strategic for fuelbreaks). The nature of the fire impact is spotty, meaning that many areas along the road burned at very low severity. To create a fuelbreak would require treatment of green vegetation in these low severity areas; the proposed action would only treat dead vegetation. Fuelbreak creation and maintenance will be considered in alternatives. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #8. Issue Statement: The proposed action should do more to address traveler safety along roads; therefore, analyze an alternative that includes wider treatments, especially downhill from treated roads. 99.STVFD Comment: P4-top paragraph-first treatment should be "logging" by ground or cable. Handwork should include the use of inmate crews to minimize the cost. Response: Salvage logging proposed under this analysis will include the use of ground and cable logging systems. This will be clarified in the Proposed Action description within the DEIS. Many factors determine the most efficient means of implementation. Implementation could include use of inmate labor, but such details are not prescribed in the NEPA analysis in order to allow flexibility in implementation when other labor options are more available and/or efficient. Inmate crews are certainly a tool often utilized by the Forest Service to achieve resource objectives including handwork and will be considered during implementation of this project. Timber sales will be designed as economically as possible, incorporating areas with high densities of larger, dead timber; weighing high priority areas with lesser priority areas; balancing higher cost logging systems and resource protection measures with lower cost areas of implementation. Industry input will be taken into consideration in that process. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action 100.STVFD Comment: P4-mid page starting "utilize" salvage should be of sufficient volume to financially support the project. Response: Removal of larger dead trees while they can pay for themselves instead of requiring appropriated funding to treat is the most efficient and productive way of dealing with the excessive fuels and hazards left after these wildfire events. It is important to note that the Forest does not expect the revenue generated by road-side salvage to cover or exceed the cost of hazard tree abatement, fuels treatment and reforestation efforts. However, revenue generated substantially offsets the cost of implementation, and timber sales would be completed by contractors which would allow the public hazard along roads to be addressed in a shorter timeframe. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage 101.STVFD Comment: P4-mid page starting "provide" have you ever looked at natural seed spacing? very close followed by survival of the fittest. Recommend 8x8 spacing favoring PP and including other species if the habitat is conducive to survival. Response: While 12x12 is typical (and often past practices promoted even denser plantations), the long-term goal of these roadside areas is to promote conditions suitable for a shaded fuelbreak, and therefore wider spacing than what is typical for managed stands is appropriate in this situation. Spacing will vary based on conditions. Additional reforestation efforts (beyond roadside areas proposed for treatment under this analysis) many be considered under a separate project analysis. See Comment/Response #109 for more information regarding planting species mix, including ponderosa pine. Issue Disposition: Conjectural and not supported by scientific or factual evidence. 102.STVFD Comment: P4-3/4 down starting "trees" definitely not-this is a sell out to environmental wackos, yard the material in to reduce fuel loading and dispose of it as appropriate. Response: Comment refers to "Trees or snags that are imminent hazards to the road and/or operations would be felled; trees that are felled outside the treatment buffer would be left onsite." The intention is that hazard trees felled outside of treatment areas would be of a lower concentration, thus not contributing significantly to fuel loading than areas of highly concentrated mortality. This suggestion may be considered in an alternative to the proposed action. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #10. Issue Statement: The proposed action would leave felled hazard trees outside the treatment buffer, which leads to heavy fuel loading; therefore, consider an alternative with a wider treatment buffer that would allow all felled hazard trees to be removed. 103.STVFD Comment: You might ask why a local VFD should get involved in a project such as this. Simple, after spending 50 years working in the woods, with lots of line fire time, now in my twilight years I am in a position requiring to send manpower and equipment out on mutual aid wildland fire initial attack. I want them all to come home at the end of the day-safe and sound. Response: The Forest is also concerned for public and firefighter safety. This project is being proposed to address some of those imminent safety concerns. We appreciate your input on this proposal. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 104.STVFD Comment: 2) inventory all roads, replace any pipes too small for storm surge, outslope, rolling dip, scarify and seed (sod makes great light-moderate use pavement). Response: All roads within the burned area were evaluated post-fire during the Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) process for areas that were in need of storm-proofing (outsloping, culvert upsizing, rolling-dips, critical-dips, spot rocking, culvert risers, etc.). Necessary treatments were initiated and are ongoing, with about 75% of the treatments completed. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage 105.TCC Comment: We are concerned and disappointed that this document has drifted from the core ideas expressed in the Trinity Collaborative’s "From Fire-kill to Fuelbreaks" proposal. The core ideas of the Trinity Collaborative are ecologically sound, economically sustainable, and socially accepted management of forest lands. Response: We assume that the references to "watering-down of key proposed items" and "drifted from the core ideas" refer to the tree planting spacing and the ripping of the soil proposed in the Trinity Collaborative's proposal. These items were adjusted in order to improve the ecological soundness of the proposal. Soils can be seriously damaged during high severity fires, especially sensitive soils; ripping of soils would cause further damage in many cases, rather than repairing fire damage. Standard Resource Protection Measures include provisions for tilling of landings, temporary roads, and main skid trails which will perform a similar function as “ripping” of soils.  Standard Resource Protection Measures include provisions to rip soils in areas that are compacted by implementation activities; these typically include landings and parts of skid trails. While 40 mature trees per acre comprises an effective shaded fuelbreak and contributes to wildlife habitat without the appearance of a plantation, the 40 trees in a shaded fuel break are the hardy persistent trees that withstood natural mortality over the decades until they effectively started to contribute shade. Without the use of herbicides and intensive tending, a high mortality rate is anticipated with post-fire reforestation. A stand is considered stocked when 75 conifer seedlings per acre survive five years after the initial planting. In areas lacking any residual live trees (contributing to a future seed source), planting a total of 40 trees per acre would do little to contribute to future forested conditions. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement. The suggested proposal, “From Fire-Kill to Fuelbreaks” is considered in its entirety under Alternative 8. 106.TCC Comment: The main focus of our "From Fire-kill to Fuelbreaks" proposal is to create the groundwork for a network of shaded fuel breaks along our forest and county roads. Removing the fuels while they can still pay their way out of the forest is a crucial element of any real recovery plan. All proposed projects involving timber harvest to help pay the costs, needs to be offered and completed while merchantable timber still has value and has not deteriorated significantly. Otherwise, there will be no viable offers received and nothing will be achieved. Harvesting operations expected to meet this constraint must be completed in calendar year 2016. Response: For a fuelbreak to be effective at reducing fire behavior, it must be contiguous, wider than the treatments proposed in the proposed action, and strategically located (not all roads are in areas that would be strategic for fuelbreaks). The nature of the fire impact is spotty, meaning that many areas along the road burned at very low severity. To create a fuelbreak would require treatment of green vegetation in these low severity areas; the proposed action would only treat dead vegetation. Fuelbreak creation and maintenance will be considered in alternative 2. While the premise for "From Fire-kill to Fuelbreaks" may have been to lay the groundwork for a network of road-based fuelbreaks, the proposal will not achieve that end result due to other constraints incorporated into the proposal (treatment of only dead vegetation and a 300-foot buffer width). The proposal does allow removal of large fuels (where commercially viable) and treatment of smaller fuels, which will reduce severity of fire behavior in the immediate road-side vicinity, upon completion of the required level of environmental analysis (EIS in this case).The Forest recognizes the importance of timely implementation of this project in order to capture any economic value still remaining in these dead trees. Removal of larger dead trees while they can pay for themselves instead of requiring appropriated funding to treat is definitely the most efficient and productive way of dealing with the excessive fuels and hazards left after these Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage wildfire events. While federal and agency regulations regarding the NEPA process for analysis must be followed, the Forest is committed to expediting the processes as much as possible by utilizing tight analysis deadlines, concurrent reviews by collaborating specialists, concurrent collaboration with regulatory agencies. The proposed action is likely to have significant impacts so it must be analyzed under an EIS. Implementation of this project in early summer is not possible due to required steps (specialist analysis, consultation with regulatory agencies, public comment periods and responses, etc.) under NEPA and ESA.It is important to note that the Forest does not expect the revenue generated by road-side salvage to cover or exceed the cost of hazard tree abatement, fuels treatment and reforestation efforts. However, revenue generated substantially offsets the cost of implementation, and timber sales would be completed by contractors which would allow the public hazard along roads to be addressed in a shorter timeframe. Addressing that hazard with Forest Service personnel alone in a short timeframe is not within our capability due to the large area affected by the fires and limited personnel. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 107.TCC Comment: The inclusion of the Emergency Situation Determination request and the absence or watering-down of key proposed items, risks damaging the credibility of collaborative members who have publicized the proposal with community members and environmental groups in attempts to obtain "social license" (i.e., support or agreement not to block or object to) these projects. The document doesn't highlight that this project was developed as a partnership with the Trinity County Collaborative group, which will help maintain the social license. Response: An Emergency Situation Determination was considered earlier in the planning process but is not being pursued at this time. The “Public Involvement” section of chapter 1 explains that the Collaborative’s “From Fire-Kill to Fuelbreaks” proposal was the basis of the Proposed Action, which is the Preferred Alternative. We assume that the reference to "watering-down of key proposed items" and refer to the tree planting spacing and the ripping of the soil proposed in the Trinity Collaborative's proposal. These items were adjusted in order to improve the "ecological soundness" of the proposal. Soils can be seriously damaged during high severity fires, especially sensitive soils; ripping of soils would cause further damage in many cases, rather than repairing fire damage. Standard Resource Protection Measures include provisions for tilling of landings, temporary roads, and main skid trails which will perform a similar function as “ripping” of soils. While 40 mature trees per acre comprises an effective shaded fuelbreak and contributes to wildlife habitat without the appearance of a plantation, the 40 trees in a shaded fuel break are the hardy persistent trees that withstood natural mortality over the decades until they effectively started to contribute shade.

A stand is considered stocked when 75 conifer seedlings per acre survive five years after the initial planting. In areas lacking any residual live trees (contributing to a future seed source), planting a total of 40 trees per acre would do little to contribute to future forested conditions. Issue Disposition: General in Nature, position statement. 108.TCC Comment: Failing to capture this opportunity to pay for the removal of all these dead fuels along the road network will create the worst possible conditions for the future control and containment of catastrophic wild fire. This would mean the loss of even more critical habit and diminished opportunities for recovery of species at risk. Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage System, County, and State roads, and to attain commercial value where it is available when meeting the hazard reduction need. The intent is to salvage timber in the treated areas, where feasible. We understand that the time frame is potentially problematic. When planning a large, complex project like this, even when the action mitigates a safety hazard, the impacts must still be assessed at the appropriate National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) level. The appropriate level of analysis for a project like this that is likely to have significant effects is an EIS, which is a time consuming process. The Forest Service is pursuing options to reduce the timeline, where available, with the intent of providing a salvage timber sale in a timely manner. While this project has the intent to reduce hazards along roads, including heavy fuel loads, the proposed action only proposes to treat dead material. The intent of the fuel reduction treatments is to reduce the severity of fire immediately adjacent to roads to allow for ingress and egress during wildfires. To impact fire behavior across a landscape, treatments would need to include fuelbreaks and be much more extensive. For a fuelbreak to be effective at reducing fire behavior, it must be contiguous, wider than the treatments proposed in the proposed action, and strategically located (not all roads are in areas that would be strategic for fuelbreaks). The nature of the fire impact is spotty, meaning that many areas along the road burned at very low severity. To create a fuelbreak would require treatment of green vegetation in these low severity areas; the proposed action would only treat dead vegetation. Fuelbreak creation and maintenance will be considered in alternatives. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action 109.TCC Comment: 1. Forest Service communications to the public need to stress: (a) No green trees will be cut, (b) No new roads will be constructed. Please keep these principles from being lost in the verbiage. We suggest these be placed in your proposed treatment discussion at the top of page 4, after the words '25 feet.' Response: The suggested changes will be incorporated into the description of the proposed action in the EIS. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action 110.TCC Comment: 2. Replace language in bullet point 5 on page 3 with original language from collaborative's proposal, "Plant mixed conifers (40-50 trees per acre at approximately 30' spacing between planted trees" . . . etc.) This comment also applies to bullet point 3 of the middle set of points on page 4 concerning "spacing of seedling of 18 to 30 feet. Our desired future condition is a (long-lived) shaded fuelbreak, not a plantation. Response: The spacing of seedlings (18-30 feet) included in the proposal includes the collaborative proposal's figure of 30-foot spacing and may be used if specifically appropriate for the ground. However, planting at 30-foot spacing is unlikely to yield the desired condition of a shaded fuelbreak due to mortality. The Forest concedes that 40 mature trees per acre comprises an effective shaded fuelbreak and contributes to wildlife habitat without the appearance of a plantation. However, those 40 trees in a shaded fuel break are the hardy persistent trees that withstood natural mortality over the decades until they effectively started to contribute shade. Without the use of herbicides and intensive tending, a high mortality rate is anticipated with post-fire reforestation. A stand is considered stocked when 75 conifer seedlings per acre survive five years after the initial planting. In areas lacking any residual live trees (contributing to a future seed source), planting a total of 40 seedlings per acre would do little to contribute to future forested conditions. Reforestation (planting) for the purposes of even-aged management historically included spacing of 6' by 6' to 8' by 8'. In the last decade or so, reforestation generally Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage consists of 12' by 12' spacing. Due to the long-term goal of these roadside areas for promoting conditions suitable for a shaded fuelbreak, and not plantation management, a wider spacing is being prescribed than is typical for managed stands. Spacing will vary based on site conditions and likelihood of success. Issue Disposition: Conjectural and not supported by scientific or factual evidence. 111.TCC Comment: Regarding fuelbreak width, there may be some places where 300' (plus road width) is not feasible, so we proposed to change the language near the bottom of page 3 to "will not exceed 300'" instead of "would always total 300'". Response: This language will be adjusted in the description of the proposed action in the EIS. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 112.TCC Comment: Regarding soil ripping (sub-soiling) to improve runoff infiltration, we clarify our proposal language to add "where deemed beneficial by the Forest Service." Response: Soils can be seriously damaged during high severity fires, especially sensitive soils; ripping of soils would cause further damage in many cases, rather than repairing fire damage. Standard Resource Protection Measures include provisions for tilling of landings, temporary roads, and main skid trails which will perform a similar function as “ripping” of soils. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action 113.TCC Comment: Regarding landings, we propose language as follows: New landings will be located on the most favorable available terrain and served by access ramps not to exceed 150'. Response: New landings are placed in the most favorable terrain available, unless over-ridden by other resource constraints. Areas such as riparian reserves, sensitive botanical habitat (such as serpentine), archeological sites, unstable land mass, etc. add constraints to landing placement. Access ramps to landings not exceeding 100 feet will be incorporated into the proposed action to clarify use. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 114.TCC Comment: The document needs to clearly state; There will be no project activities occurring within Wilderness Areas or Inventoried Roadless Areas. Response: The proposed action states that there are no proposed treatments in wilderness. This project, however, does treat along roads open for public use (National Forest System roads with a maintenance level of 2, 3, or 4, as well as county and state roads). Some of these open roads occur in Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRA). These roads will be treated, consistent with the purpose and need of the project, but will have additional resource protection measures (i.e. limited mechanical treatments outside of road prism) in place to maintain the existing integrity of the IRA. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action (no treatment in wilderness). Alternative driving issue (no treatment in IRA). Issue Statement: Treatments in Inventoried Roadless Areas would have a negative impact; therefore, include an alternative that does not treat in IRAs. Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage 115.TCC Comment: In conclusion we believe the choice in this circumstance of doing a full Environmental Impact Statement is the wrong vehicle to protect the environment and allow for economic success or to achieve the desired future conditions, as outlined in the Trinity Collaborative "From Fire-kill to Fuelbreaks" and the "Pilot Roadside shaded fuel break project". Because of EIS timelines it is our very real concern that this course of action will fail and that no restoration and fuel removal will occur. To this end, we urge Shasta-Trinity National Forest to choose to either; 1) pursue our recommendation to do an expedited EIS with significantly shorten time frames that would allow the Forest Service to complete the whole project or 2) if all other attempts fail, to select strategic locations with the best timber value and least environmental constraints, utilizing multiple CE's based on either a watershed criteria or the individual fires. Response: The level of NEPA analysis is dictated by the level of impacts expected to occur from the proposed action. An EIS is required when project impacts are expected to be significant. Impacts of the proposed action are expected to be significant due to the cumulative effects of the fire impacts, the number of watersheds impacted by fire and the proposed action, and the amount of sensitive wildlife habitat in and within close proximity to the proposed action; therefore, an EIS is the correct NEPA analysis type. The scale of the project would need to be significantly changed to reduce the level of impacts to non-significant, which would leave many miles of wildfire impacted roadside untreated. The current timeline to develop an EIS is an estimate based partly on legally required timelines such as comment periods, and on the amount of time it typically takes to complete the complex level of analysis required for an EIS. Issue Disposition: Already decided by law, regulation, or policy 116.TCC Comment: We support the Trinity Collaborative's "from fire kill to fuelbreak" proposal as it was submitted to the Shasta Trinity National Forest. Response: We appreciate your input and your interest in public land management. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement. The Trinity Collaborative’s proposal will be considered as an alternative. 117.Jaegel, Roger Comment: Please consider the Community Wildfire Protection Plans for the Communities in Trinity County in the effort to achieve fuel reduction for resource and community protection from future fire events.

This resolution was passed 2/5/2008 before the fires in 2008 and is still valid. Response: The project analysis will take the Trinity County CWPP into account, and the fuels specialist is aware of Resolution 2008-006. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 118.Jaegel, Roger Comment: The proposed project will only address a small percentage of the forest area affected by the 2015 fires on the Shasta Trinity National Forest. The project should include all areas within or adjacent to the wildland urban interface areas around communities as suggested in the Community Wildfire Protection Plans. Response: The Forest Service recognizes the high fuel loading on the Forest is a concern for fire hazard, especially to rural communities. This project is one project that has the goal to move Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage towards desired fuel loading conditions. It is focused on roads, which can be used as ingress and egress for rural communities. The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. Because the intent of this project is to treat roadside areas, larger fuel reduction treatments within WUI are outside the scope of this project, but could be considered under other projects in the future. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project. 119.Jaegel, Roger Comment: Research suggests fuel loading of greater than 20-30 tons/acre in mixed conifer forest will result in unacceptable risk in terms of excessive fuel loads and extreme resistance to control factors. These conditions will persist for over 60 years if fuels are not reduced. It is most important to reduce the heavy (1000 hr.+) fuels. This fuel type is the most difficult and costly to mitigate and often removal is the only answer. Response: The proposed action would reduce downed logs to 10-20 tons per acre in the treatment buffer along roads. Downed logs includes woody material >3-inches in diameter including fuels created by salvage and suppression actions. The Forest Service agrees that the large logs are the most difficult to treat with fuels reduction treatments, and that the most effective way to meet the desired fuel tonnage is to remove the logs from the unit. However, this does have an impact on soils that must be analyzed and reduced to the extent practicable. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action. 120.Jaegel, Roger Comment: The current drought and accelerated insect and disease in the conifers around the fire areas will continue to add fuel loading for years and possibly decades to come. It's past time to consider the current research, science and our experience in analysis of these fuel conditions and the importance of mitigation to our communities and adjacent resources. Response: The Forest Service recognizes the high fuel loading on National Forest System lands is a concern for fire hazard, especially to rural communities. This project has the goal to move towards desired fuel loading conditions. It is focused on roads, which can be used as ingress and egress for rural communities. Because the intent of this project is to treat roadside areas, larger fuel reduction treatments within WUI are not appropriate under this project, but could be considered under other projects. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 121.Jaegel, Roger Comment: Please review the following when considering the scope of the project. -Trinity County Community Wildfire Protection Plans -Trinity County Resolution 2008-6 -Trinity County Safety Element -Letters from Trinity Fire Safe Council to Senator Barbara Boxer (attached) -Coarse Woody Debris: Managing benefit and fire hazard for the recovering forest. Brown, James K., Rienhardt, Elizabeth D., Kramer, Kyle A. -GTR-RMRS-105 -Post fire logging reduces surface woody fuels for up to four decades following wildfire, David W. Peterson, Erik Dodson, Ricky J. Harrod; Forest Ecology and Management, 339(2015)84-94-1. Response: The documents have been reviewed and the relevant science will be included in the analysis and disclosed in chapter 3 of the EIS. The purpose of the project is to reduce hazards (dead trees and fuel loading) along roads, including roads that are used for ingress and egress for rural communities, which is consistent with the Trinity County Community Wildfire Protection Plan. Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 122.McKinney, Lisa Comment: After attending the meeting regarding fire salvage, I am disappointed in the USFS's decision to capitulate to the pressure of an organization whose interest is not in addressing the needs of the burned areas, but is more directed at meeting political agendas. I am referring specifically to the USFS's endorsement of the Collaborative's proposal for fire salvage. Response: Your concerns are noted. Your suggested changes to the proposed action are discussed in other responses and are considered in alternatives to the proposed action. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 123.McKinney, Lisa Comment: I believe the USFS should remove all hazard trees based on the REGION 5 FIRE INJURED TREE GUIDELINES such as were used on the Stafford Fire Salvage. These guidelines based on science, fire events, and compiled by experts, allow fire damaged trees meeting a specific probability of mortality to be removed. This allows removal on the first entry, of trees which are dying, rather than hoping for a second or third entry some months later. Economically, with the discussion that no extra money will be allocated for this project, this seems reasonable. The Collaborative proposes to remove only trees which are completely dead, and the USFS has agreed to this, but this neither fully addresses the damage nor meets the needs of the land. Response: The Forest recognizes that green needles does not indicate that a tree will survive and thrive. Cambial death does often take time for the needles to respond to lack of resources and turn brown. The Forest does have experience in determining the probability of mortality (as referenced in the comment regarding the Stafford Fire Salvage of 2013). If the proposed action were consistent with the Stafford Fire Salvage Project, the Forest would evaluate cambium injury under the direction of Marking guidelines for fire-injured trees in California (Smith and Cluck 2011).The proposed action includes removal of dead trees at time of implementation. At the time of implementation, most mortality directly due to cambium injury should be realized; however, additional mortality (primarily due to secondary agents such as insects exploiting weakened trees) is anticipated for a few more years. Utilizing the probability of mortality as directed in the Marking Guidelines for fire-injured trees in California may be considered under an alternative to the proposed action. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #11. Issue Statement: The proposed action only proposes to remove trees that are dead at the time of implementation, but this does not address all of the trees that will die from fire damage, which means the treatments do not fully address the hazard; analyze an alternative that would remove dying trees as well as dead trees, consistent with the Region 5 Fire Injured Tree Guidelines. 124.McKinney, Lisa Comment: I believe the USFS should address ALL hazard trees on roads in the fire areas including those roads that are categorized as LEVEL I. Although you've stated that LEVEL I roads are supposed to be closed to vehicle traffic, I am here to tell you that as a 45 year resident of Hyampom, and an avid hiker, these roads are not closed to foot travel. A hazard tree falls where and when despite who or what's underneath it. Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage 125.McKinney, Lisa Comment: The time frame for producing the necessary analysis is also troubling. Fire damaged trees degrade at a rapid rate, but when species and diameter are added, degradation is accelerated, and the time frame for removal is shortened. The length of time to complete the analysis is important to a perspective purchaser whose economic pressures are compounded by length of time, Limited Operating Periods, market prices, etc. Response: Fire killed and damaged trees can deteriorate at a more rapid rate than those naturally fading due to insects, certain diseases, and parasites. In addition, this deterioration does vary depending on species, diameter and extent of injury (Cluck and Smith 2007). Small diameter sawtimber killed by the fire are likely to have lost merchantability potential by the time implementation of this project occurs. Therefore, areas identified for commercial removal will have larger diameter trees, and merchantability specifications in timber removal contracts will be adjusted according to conditions. The Forest Service recognizes the economic complexities surrounding removal of deteriorating timber in a timely manner, especially when combined with limited operating periods and weather constraints. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 126.McKinney, Lisa Comment: A separate analysis addressing the existing decks and Saddle Fire Salvage, areas already prepped, should be considered. Response: Separate analyses addressing existing decks and the Saddle Fire area are being considered. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project 127.McKinney, Lisa Comment: In addition, I believe the USFS needs to address as soon as possible, the fire injured areas comprised of tractor ground which have no stream course protection issues, wildlife concerns, or road building requirements. There are substantial areas within the fire area meeting these, and this alone would require a formidable effort, but this would help reduce fuel loading, provide a treated area for replanting, and capture some of the value of the burned resource. Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. Areas that are outside of this narrow focus are outside the scope of this analysis but may be considered under a different project analysis, including planting on a larger landscape scale. Unfortunately, due to the unique character of the Forest, there are few areas that can be classified as not having wildlife concerns, watershed concerns, road building needs, consistent with Forest Plan direction and located on flat ground. While these constraints are not prohibitive of action, they do require an appropriate level of analysis under NEPA, in this case, an EIS. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project 128.McKinney, Lisa Comment: Further, I feel that the USFS should temporarily remove road restrictions within the fire area for gathering and removal of fire wood for personal use. This could be instrumental in alleviating some of the road side fuel loading and would serve the community in a valuable way. Response: Temporary forest road closure orders within the footprints of the 2015 wildfires were lifted on November 24, 2015. Removal of personal use firewood is permitted with a valid 2016 Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Shasta-Trinity National Forest Fuelwood Cutting Permit both within and outside the fire footprints. Note that some open roads may be closed seasonally to protect various resources (i.e. wildlife, erosion, etc). Refer to the Shasta-Trinity National Forest Motor Vehicle Use Map (free and attached to all fuelwood permit purchases) to ensure compliance with 2010 Travel Management direction. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project 129.McKinney, Lisa Comment: Other concerns voiced by the USFS at the meeting: * Fear that an aggressive plan of action, as perceived by other organizations, could result in legal action. * No additional funding is being allocated for the fire salvage project. * Concern of contributing to cumulative watershed sedimentation. These are all topics of concern. However, cumulative watershed sedimentation will be immaterial to a watershed that has been rendered unproductive due to fire damage with increased fuel loading and no regeneration. The threat of legal action and the lack of funding are not adequate reasons for failing to take appropriate and timely action. Without an aggressive and comprehensive plan, the Shasta-Trinity National Forest will once again become a tinder box awaiting ignition from the next lightning storm. Response: The Forest continues to plan projects to appropriately manage Forest Service System lands regardless of litigation pressure. Project planning and associated impact analysis must be conducted carefully and thoughtfully under these conditions to ensure that projects can be implemented. Availability of Forest personnel and funding to address the hazards along roads, as well as the necessary fire restoration, are limited. Projects must be prioritized and carefully planned to ensure the best use of our limited planning and implementation resources. Additional restoration activities (beyond road buffers associated with the purpose and need for this project), including fuels reduction and reforestation, may be considered under other projects. Impacts of the project on watersheds must be analyzed, including an analysis of the cumulative watershed effects. Some watersheds may already be over established disturbance threshold due to fire impacts, as well as impacts from other past and present actions (logging on private land, etc.). Regardless of the level of effect anticipated from this action, it must be evaluated on a landscape/watershed scale and disclosed in the Hydrology Specialist Report. Mitigations may be required to reduce the level of impacts from this project in these sensitive, over threshold watersheds to comply with the Forest Plan and regulations under the Clean Water Act. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 130.McKinney, Lisa Comment: It is important that the USFS does everything within agency power to execute the job to which it is charged. It seems that by removing only completely dead trees on LEVEL II ROADS and above as the only focus for fire salvage is not sufficient. As the USDA Forest Service mission states, "Sustaining the health, diversity, and productivity of the Nation's forests and grasslands in order to meet the needs of present and future generations" should come before political agendas, capitulation, fear of litigation, and lack of funding. Response: Your concerns are noted. Your suggested changes to the proposed action are discussed in other responses and are considered in alternatives to the proposed action. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 131.TCBS Comment: You heard the unanimous support that this project proposal received at the Trinity County Collaborative's Forestry work group meeting on September 18th. It also received the support of the full Collaborative through an electronic vote on September 25th. Today the Board Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage of Supervisors reviewed the proposal and I am writing to express the Board's Support for this project within both Shasta-Trinity and Six Rivers National Forests. Response: We appreciate your input and your interest in public land management. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 132.TCBS Comment: We all realize that this summer's wildfires have had a dramatic impact on the program of work for the Forest, but we would encourage you and your staff to continue to work with the Collaborative to find the most efficient NEPA mechanism to implement this project as soon as possible. Response: The level of NEPA analysis is dictated by the level of impacts expected to occur from the proposed action. An EIS is required when project impacts are expected to be significant. Impacts of the proposed action are expected to be significant due to the cumulative effects of the fire impacts, the number of watersheds impacted by fire and the proposed action, and the amount of sensitive wildlife habitat in and within close proximity to the proposed action; therefore, an EIS is the correct NEPA analysis type. The scale of the project would need to be significantly changed to reduce the level of impacts to non-significant, which would leave many miles of wildfire impacted roadside untreated. The current timeline to develop an EIS is an estimate based partly on legally required timelines such as comment periods, and on the amount of time it typically takes to complete the complex level of analysis required for an EIS. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action 133.EPA Comment: EPA recognizes the ecological significance of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest and we would like to work with the Forest Service to speed the process of environmental review and to insure the inclusion of resource protection measures in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. Response: Thank you for the comment. We are considering your comments for inclusion as resource protection measures. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 134.EPA Comment: EPA supports the effort to rehabilitate the fire-damaged watersheds as soon as possible. We acknowledge the need to reforest in order to stabilize the soil and prevent soil losses from debris flows and mudflows. We also understand the desire to harvest fire-killed trees while there is sufficient timber value to fund needed restoration efforts. Response: Thank you for your comment. Landscape level planting is not addressed in this project (outside the purpose and need), but areas treated along roads would be planted. Landscape level planting may be considered under a separate project. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 135.EPA Comment: We recommend that the DEIS include a range of alternatives that meets the stated purpose and need, goals and objectives, and, responds to issues identified during the scoping process. The alternatives analysis should compare alternatives with respect to how well they respond to the stated purpose and need, goals and objectives, and, scoping issues. The Council on Environmental Quality recommends that all reasonable alternatives be considered, even if some Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage of them could be outside the capability of the applicant or the jurisdiction of the agency preparing the EIS. Consistent with the purpose of the NEPA, the EPA encourages selection of alternatives that protect, restore and enhance the environment. We support efforts to identify and select alternatives which maximize environmental benefits, and, avoid, minimize, and/or otherwise mitigate environmental impacts. If a Preferred Alternative is identified, it should be included in the DEIS (40 CFR 1502.14(e)). Response: We are in the process of developing a range of alternatives. The alternatives will be compared for how well they meet the purpose and need and issues brought up during scoping. All reasonable alternatives will be considered. The preferred alternative will be identified in the DEIS. Mitigations will be considered in any watersheds that exceed the threshold of concern and will be included in each alternative. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 136.EPA Comment: We also recommend that the DEIS evaluate in detail the potential direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of the proposed action on all aquatic, riparian, and terrestrial species that are listed as sensitive, threatened, and/or endangered. Response: The DEIS will analyze direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of the alternatives on the aquatic, riparian, and terrestrial sensitive, threatened and/or endangered species. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 137.EPA Comment: EPA encourages the Forest Service to include in the DEIS the results of a comprehensive biological survey of the Project area if available. Without such a survey, it would be difficult to accurately evaluate the environmental impacts of the proposed action. Response: The wildfires of 2015 created public safety hazards across a large area on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Even if adequate funding were available, it would not be possible to conduct comprehensive field surveys for every wildlife species of concern across the entire project area in the time frame necessary to respond to the urgent need for hazard abatement. The best available science will be used to assess potential effects to wildlife. The Shasta-Trinity National Forest maintains an extensive database of wildlife observations that have been collected over several decades. Potential effects will be assessed using this database, as well as wildlife observations documented in the State of California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB). Habitat assessments utilizing field observations and aerial imagery will also used in these analyses. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 138.EPA Comment: The DEIS section on environmental impacts ought to also include evaluations of: air quality, water quality, climate change, and noxious weeds, as well as impacts involving roads and landings. Response: The DEIS will include analyses of air quality, water quality, climate change, and noxious weed risk, and will analyze impacts of roads and logging activities. Landings are assumed to be part of logging activity in the hydrologic model, but are not explicitly analyzed with respect to location, number, or size. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage 139.EPA Comment: EPA recommends the Forest Service determine which aspects of the project comply with EPA's Interim Air Quality Policy on Wildland and Prescribed Fires and are included as part of the applicable EPA approved Smoke Management Program. All other aspects of the project should be evaluated for general conformity applicability to determine whether a full conformity analysis needs to be conducted. The applicable EPA approved SMPs should be included as part of the DEIS. Response: Smoke from prescribed fire is managed so that emissions meet applicable state and federal standards, including the EPA’s Smoke Management Program. For prescribed burning, the Forest Service utilizes Best Available Control Measures (BACMs) for smoke and Best Smoke Management Practices (BSMPS)(NRCS 2011) to reduce particulate emissions. BACMs are a combination of practices intended to reduce emissions to the lowest practicable amount. BACMs are accomplished by diluting or dispersing emissions, or by preventing potential emission sources whenever possible. Smoke emissions will be calculated for machine pile burning, jackpot burning and for potential future wildfires under scenarios created by each alternative, including the no action. Greenhouse gas emissions will be calculated and evaluated for general conformity applicability. According to the EPA Green Book, updated November 17, 2015, Trinity County is Designated a Non-Attainment Area for PM10; the project area falls within this county. The Yolla-Bolly-Middle-Eel Wilderness Area is a Federal Class 1 area adjacent to the project area. The Forest Service also follows the guidelines assigned by the CARB [ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP), visibility SIPs, and Title 17] to limit state-wide exposure on a cumulative basis, in compliance with the Clean Air Act (CARB 2001; 2008). Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 140.EPA Comment: EPA recommends that Forest Service use the Council on Environmental Quality's December 18, 2014 revised draft guidance for Federal agencies ' consideration of GHG emissions and climate change impacts in NEPA as it outlines a reasonable approach to outline the framework for its analysis of these issues. Accordingly, we recommend the DEIS qualitatively describe relevant climate change impacts from the project and analyze reasonable alternatives and/or practicable mitigation measures to reduce project-related GHG emissions. Response: The EPA’s recommendation will be followed for analysis of GHG emissions and climate change impacts. Mitigation measures will be applied to reduce emissions to the extent practicable. See response to comment #139. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 141.EPA Comment: EPA suggests that the DEIS include a systematic and comprehensive discussion of the impacts of climate change on the project area. We recommend considering climate change adaptation measures where appropriate. For example, adding a discussion of the increased vulnerability of specific species under a reasonably anticipated climate change scenario, and an explanation of the projected shift of forest species to more suitable range elevations. We also recommend that the DEIS discuss measures to improve forest adaptation to climate change, such as the selection of certain species for replanting. Response: Climate change will be addressed for each resource area in which it is relevant. Given the size of the atmospheric pool of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) in relation to the GHGs emitted by this project, this project is not expected to have a meaningfully measureable effect on climate, Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage much less species ranges. As a result, cumulative effects of this project on species ranges will not be discussed. When planting trees, the mix of conifer seedlings will include conifer seedlings that were germinated from seed collected from lower elevation bands within the seed zone. Regarding other species, there is no national or regional policy regarding techniques such as utilizing seeds from different elevations for potential replanting sites and employing other forms of assisted migration of species (Johnson et al. 2013b). Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 142.EPA Comment: We also recommend the DEIS include a comprehensive survey of noxious weed species within the project area, as well as possible mitigation measures, such as: clean all off-road logging and construction equipment prior to entering the project area to remove dirt, plant parts and material that may carry weed seeds; include equipment cleaning in the timber sale contract; and require equipment to avoid weed infested areas. Response: Prevention and management measures to minimize introduction and spread of noxious weeds will be incorporated into the design of the proposed action.  Resource protection measures to prevent introduction and spread of noxious weeds as a result of planned actions will be applied project-wide. These resource protection measures are consistent with those suggested by the commenter. Weeds will be removed in the project area as funding allows. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action 143.EPA Comment: We support robust road, landing maintenance and restoration programs that fully offset adverse effects of the proposed project such as reduction of sediment sources to benefit fish and aquatic systems. Response: Roads and landings that would be used in this project would be maintained and rehabilitated, respectively. Road and trail rehabilitation or decommissioning is outside the scope of this project, but may be considered under other projects. Resource protection measures addressing rehabilitation of landings, including recontouring, planting, ripping or scarifying, and a schedule will be included. The proposed action does not include the use of temporary roads. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action 144.EPA Comment: We recommend the Forest Service consider alternatives which avoid or minimize extensive roadwork in watersheds that exceed the Threshold of Concern for cumulative watershed effects. Response: We are in the process of developing a range of alternatives. The alternatives will be compared for how well they meet the purpose and need and issues brought up during scoping. All reasonable alternatives will be considered. The preferred alternative will be identified in the DEIS. Mitigations will be considered in any watersheds that exceed the threshold of concern and will be included in each alternative. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #14. Issue Statement: The project could negatively impact watersheds that are already over the threshold concern; therefore, consider an alternative that minimizes treatments in those watersheds. 145.EPA Comment: The project may call for the decommissioning and restoration of roads. We encourage the Forest Service to include a plan with a list and map of the roads, landings and trails that will Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage be impacted by the project. This plan would benefit if the DEIS included specific information on the extent to which these roads and landings would be recontoured, replanted with appropriate vegetation, monitored, and closed to off highway vehicle use. We recommend the DEIS include a specific post-harvest schedule for closure of the temporary roads and landings. The DEIS should commit to scarifying the surface of roads, landings, and trails selected for decommissioning to break up compacted soils, seeding such areas, and blocking vehicle traffic with rocks and/or barricades. Response: Roads and landings that would be used in this project would be maintained and rehabilitated, respectively. Some road reconstruction, restoration, and maintenance will be performed as connected actions and are disclosed in chapter 2. Some legacy sediment sites will be treated as a condition of the North Coast Regional Water Board Waiver which will be determined as part of the Waiver coverage after the signing of the ROD. Resource protection measures addressing rehabilitation of landings, including recontouring, planting, ripping or scarifying, and a schedule will be included. The proposed action does not include the use of temporary roads. Issue Disposition: Resolved through inclusion of a project design feature or a resource protection measure. 146.EPA Comment: We appreciate the opportunity to review this NOI. When the DEIS is released for public review, please send one hard copy and three CDs to the address above (mail code: ENF-42). Response: The DEIS will be sent to the EPA when it is available. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 147.KSW Comment: Please ensure that we are sent hard copies of forthcoming NEPA and decision documents concerning this project. Response: The commenters have been added to the project mailing list and will be informed of any opportunities to comment as the project planning proceeds. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 148.KSW Comment: Our organization appreciates the project focus on roadside hazard treatments along open Forest Service roads. By avoiding controversial unit salvage logging far from roads, and by limiting roadside salvage logging of hazard trees to open roads (ML 2 and above) the agency will reduce potential social and legal conflict and increase stakeholder support. Response: We appreciate your input and your interest in public land management. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 149.KSW Comment: * Please avoid machine piling of slash. Machine piling, particularly on recovering post-fire soils, results in significant (and avoidable) impacts to soil resources. Response: The project will be designed to meet or exceed the Shasta-Trinity Land and Resource Management Plan soil quality standards by incorporating soil Resource Protection Measures. An alternative that doesn't include machine piling will be considered. Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #15. Issue Statement: Machine piling has a negative impact on soils; therefore, analyze an alternative that would not include machine piling. 150.KSW Comment: * Please do not yard hazard trees in or through Riparian Reserves. Snags in Riparian Reserves provide a vital source of course woody debris that is essential to riparian function. Please do not retard riparian recovery through logging actions that necessitate yarding in or through Riparian Reserves. Response: Riparian Reserves consist of two zones: a near stream zone that contains riparian vegetation and a second zone of upland vegetation further from the stream. An equipment exclusion zone will be established in the near stream zone to protect stream bank and riparian vegetation integrity. Hazard trees may be skidded or yarded out of the upland area of the Riparian Reserves where it has been determined that the remaining amount of downed coarse woody debris (CWD) and non-hazardous snags left on site are sufficient to maintain a properly functioning stream riparian zone. Logs in excess of this standard create a fuel loading that can have negative impacts on the health of the riparian area in future fires. All hazard tree skidding and yarding, regardless of the land allocation, will be accomplished with the leading end of the log suspended in order to minimize ground disturbance. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #16. Issue Statement: Logging has a negative impact in Riparian Reserves; therefore, analyze an alternative that does not include logging in Riparian Reserve. 151.KSW Comment: * We understand that a Portland-based timber industry trade association group is requesting that the Forest Service ignore or reject the recommendations of the Trinity Collaborative and instead conduct controversial non-road related salvage logging activities that will harm forest recovery. This "timber first" approach was tried in the Klamath National National Forest in the recent Westside Salvage project and has proven to be an unwise use of federal planning resources. Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to "Reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads". All alternatives considered under this project analysis must be consistent with this stated purpose and need for action. Alternatives proposed during scoping that are consistent with this purpose and need will be appropriately analyzed under this EIS. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 152.KSW Comment: We support the project focus on establishing a safe transportation system through the timely removal of hazard trees near ML 2, 3 a 4 Forest Service roads. Response: We appreciate your input and your interest in public land management. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 153.AFRC Comment: The first question is why an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)? The current proposal only plans to accomplish roadside treatments with emphasis on reducing public hazards and promoting public safety. The reduction of hazards and public safety should be the only key issue identified with the proposed action. It should override any other issues identified. During wildfires public/firefighter safety is the number one objective and that should continue until these Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage issues have adequately been dealt with during post fire restoration. With that being the overriding purpose and need we believe the Forest should approach this project with a CE or at the most an EA for NEPA documentation. By proposing an EIS it appears that significant issues are going to occur through the implementation of public safety work. Taking care of emergency public safety issues should be done as soon as possible and in a time frame to minimize the current risk and hazards. If reducing roadside hazard conditions are so important we believe you should look at options of completing the necessary work to reduce risk to human health and safety in a quicker time frame. Response: Planning a project using a Categorical Exclusion (CE) requires the availability of a CE category that applies to the proposed action. In the case of this project, the proposed action is not covered by a CE category due to its size (number of acres proposed for treatment). To use a CE, there must be no extraordinary circumstances (36 CFR 220.6). An Environmental Assessment (EA) is prepared when the level of effects is unknown; when the effects analysis completed for the EA determines that no significant impacts would occur, a decision can be made using that analysis. When effects are found to be significant, an EIS must be prepared. For this project, preliminary analysis indicates that impacts of the proposed action are likely to be significant, precluding the use of either a CE or an EA for the proposed action. The fact that the condition constitutes an emergency does not negate the fact that the impacts of mitigating the emergency condition are significant. Late summer implementation would accomplish the goal of salvaging some areas to produce a commercial timber output. Snags along roads that present an imminent health and safety hazard may be abated before a project decision is made (felled and left onsite). Fuels buildup from those actions would not be treated prior to a decision, and timber value from felled snags would not be available for sale until after the decision is made. Issue Disposition: Already decided by law, regulation, or policy 154. AFRC Comment: While we concur that reducing hazards along the road system is necessary we also have serious concerns about the lack of proposed treatment of areas with high fire severity away from the 300 foot road buffer.[...]why aren't you looking at doing additional restorative activities? There are many areas away from the proposed road treatments that could be easily accessed to promote recovery and producing future forests through responsible management. By not doing anything away from the road systems it gives the appearance the Shasta Trinity has no desire to put an effort into restoring green forests for the future. We believe you should at least look at areas of high mortality immediately adjacent to the road treatment units that are easily accessible. Response: Additional restoration/reforestation and salvage are considered under additional alternatives, and treatments away from roads may be considered under other projects. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project 155. AFRC Comment: The Yreka Office of the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) submitted a letter to the Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors referencing a letter previously sent to the Klamath National Forest concerning their attempt at reducing public risk. The letter stated; "In a letter from our Regional Director to the Regional Forester of the Forest Service dated May 11, 2015, the FWS communicated to the Forest Service that if the Forest Service believes there is a risk to human health and safety, then it is our view that this project would be an emergency action under 50 C.F.R. 402.05. Under these provisions the Forest Service can, and should, implement the Westside Fire Recovery Project immediately. The FWS would then complete consultation on this project after the threats to human health and safety have been addressed." It appears that your proposal falls within these bounds and we ask that you look at all options to utilize this direction Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage from the FWS in your project planning. As a minimum you should consider consulting after the fact on state and county roads, and we feel Forest Service roads should meet these guidelines as well. Take the FWS up on their view point! I have attached a copy of this letter for your consideration. Response: This proposal will be considered with the guidance of the USDA, Office of General Council for its feasibility. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 156. AFRC Comment: Without treatment these areas will recover very slowly. As stated in your scoping letter, these areas will burn again and with greater intensity. This is about as close as one can come to true deforestation. Without any type of treatment and reforestation these areas will be prone to recurring burns which will promote the constant establishment of brush fields and no reliance on future conifers stands. As a minimum, those areas of moderate and high fire severity will not see green, resilient, healthy forests for at least 300 years. Response: Additional restoration/reforestation and salvage are considered under additional alternatives, and treatments away from roads may be considered under other projects. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 157. AFRC Comment: Reforestation is an essential element that seems to be missing in your proposal. It is imperative that reforestation occur in order to quickly establish conifers on the land base while assuring the correct and desired species is promoted. The dry Mediterranean climate is not conducive to promoting natural regeneration, especially in terms of desired conifer numbers and species. With that being said we also want to go on record of not supporting reforestation in areas where there has been no salvage and/or fuel reduction. Reforestation in these conditions is like throwing tax payers money away as they will burn again and all the money and efforts spent reestablishing a forest will be lost. Response: Resforestation is included in the road treatment buffer under the proposed action. Additional restoration/reforestation and salvage are considered under additional alternatives, and treatments away from roads may be considered under other projects. . Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action 158. AFRC Comment: If the Forest is determined to stick with completing an EIS, that will not be completed until August, 2016, we believe you should look for additional restoration acres that are away from the 300 foot road buffer but easily accessible for potential salvage/restoration activities. Response: Additional restoration/reforestation and salvage are considered under additional alternatives, and treatments away from roads may be considered under other projects. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project 159. AFRC Comment: We have a major concern about the proposed August 2016 decision date for this project. This is probably an optimistic date. Past experience on these types of projects have shown these dates are never met. More than one year after a fire reduces the amount of merchantable wood that will be available, reducing the effectiveness of your hazard reduction. A CE and EA would allow for a quicker time frame. Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Response: Planning a project using a Categorical Exclusion (CE) requires the availability of a CE category that applies to the proposed action. In the case of this project, the proposed action is not covered by a CE category due to its size (number of acres proposed for treatment). To use a CE, there must be no extraordinary circumstances (36 CFR 220.6). An Environmental Assessment (EA) is prepared when the level of effects is unknown; when the effects analysis completed for the EA determines that no significant impacts would occur, a decision can be made using that analysis. When effects are found to be significant, an EIS must be prepared. For this project, preliminary analysis indicates that impacts of the proposed action are likely to be significant, precluding the use of either a CE or an EA for the proposed action. The fact that the condition constitutes an emergency does not negate the fact that the impacts of mitigating the emergency condition are significant. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 160. AFRC Comment: The proposed 300 foot buffer is a good start, but may not prove workable in some situations. You may have trees on both sides of the road that are more than 150 feet tall with the ability to fall on the road. In other cases there may be shorter trees than what the 300 foot buffer needs. We ask that you consider doing a true hazard tree prescription and remove all trees that have the potential to hit the road and pose serious hazards to the public. Response: A wider buffer will be addressed in a separate alternative; however, trees and snags that pose a hazard to roads or workers outside of identified treatment buffers would be abated and left onsite under the proposed action. The proposed action only proposes to treat along roads that are open to the public; closed roads would not be treated unless they are necessary for operations, and then hazards would be abated and left onsite. Areas that burned at low severity where substantial green trees remain would likely not contain enough commercial value for the logs to be salvaged; imminent hazards would be abated in these areas and left onsite to contribute to log retention and erosion control where desired fuel loading would not be exceeded. All open roads will be treated to the same standard. The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads, fuels treatments around private properties outside of road buffers is outside the scope of this project, but may be considered in other future projects. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #6. Issue Statement: The proposed 300 foot buffer would not allow removal of all hazardous trees; therefore, consider an alternative that would allow removal of all hazardous trees. 161. AFRC Comment: We understand this proposal came from the Trinity Collaborative and we commend them for finding some common ground to accomplish some of the needed restorative work. But we also ask the Forest to look at the proposal and see if it is truly accomplishing the job in terms of adequately and fully reducing public risk. It is your responsibility to manage these lands and take input from all concerned publics, not just one small group. What they have is a start but we believe more work should be done and some modification to the roadside prescription is Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage necessary, including additional restoration outside the roadside zones, in order fully meet your purpose and need for the project. Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. A wider road buffer width will be considered under other alternatives. Additional treatments outside of the road buffer along roads are not considered in this project because it is outside of the purpose and need, but may be considered under other projects. The proposed action moves the landscape towards the desired future condition outlined in the purpose and need. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of this project (restoration away from roads). Alternative driving issue #6 (modification to the roadside prescription). Issue statement: The proposed 300 foot buffer would not allow removal of all hazardous trees; therefore, consider an alternative that would allow removal of all hazardous trees. 162. AFRC Comment: Scope the salvage proposal quickly. Response: Public scoping was completed in December 2015. AFRC is on our project mailing list and will be informed of public meetings and field trips. The offer for design and logging system assistance will be considered. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 163. AFRC Comment: Involve industry early in the process. Response: Public scoping was completed in December 2015. AFRC is on our project mailing list and will be informed of public meetings and field trips. The offer for design and logging system assistance will be considered. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 164. AFRC Comment: Emphasize roadside hazard along open public access routes. Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action 165. AFRC Comment: Look at other restoration opportunities beside just roadside treatments. Response: Additional restoration/reforestation and salvage are considered under additional alternatives, and treatments away from roads may be considered under other projects. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project 166. AFRC Comment: Prioritize areas of completely dead. Mixed green will create a longer analysis period and will also make sale preparation more complex. Response: Hazards exist along all miles of roads within the burned areas at varying degrees that require treatment. The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fireDraft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action 167. AFRC Comment: Prioritize land allocations: emphasize Matrix and those areas along existing roads. Response: The Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project prioritizes areas along existing roads. All proposed implementation activities focus on treatment along roads open to the public (National Forest System maintenance level 2, 3 and 4 roads, as well as state and county roads impacted by wildfire). While all open roads are analyzed for hazard tree felling and fuels treatment, salvage (removal) of fire killed and mortally injured trees is influenced by land allocation and ecological function. Salvage removal will not be prioritized in riparian reserves, certain inventoried roadless areas, or known northern spotted owl nesting cores. Salvage and fuels treatment is prohibited in designated Wilderness Areas. The majority of treatment areas are in the Adaptive Management Area and Late Successional Reserves. Matrix lands comprise a relatively small percentage (5%) of area adjacent to open roads affected by wildfire. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 168. AFRC Comment: Search for those areas that contain the lower cost harvest systems. Only incorporate higher cost logging systems when you have a considerable amount of ground based that can offset costs and there are enough concentrated acres of higher cost logging systems. Response: Salvage logging proposed under this analysis will include the use of ground and cable logging systems. This will be clarified in the Proposed Action description within the EIS. Many factors determine the most efficient means of implementation. Timber sales will be designed as economically as possible, incorporating areas with high densities of larger, dead timber; weighing high priority areas with lesser priority areas; balancing higher cost logging systems and resource protection measures with lower cost areas of implementation. Industry input will be taken into consideration in that process. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 169. AFRC Comment: Prioritize those areas adjacent to private properties. Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads, fuels treatments around private properties outside of road buffers is outside the scope of this project, but may be considered in other projects. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project 170. AFRC Comment: Since this project will not be implemented until next field season much of the smaller diameter material will not be merchantable. Concentrate your efforts in stands that contain larger diameter material, >16 inches DBH. Response: Fire killed and damaged trees can deteriorate at a more rapid rate than those naturally fading due to insects, certain diseases, and parasites. In addition, this deterioration does vary depending on species, diameter and extent of injury (Cluck and Smith 2007). Small diameter sawtimber killed by the fire are likely to have lost merchantability potential by the time Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage implementation occurs. Therefore, areas identified for commercial removal will have larger diameter trees, and merchantability specifications in timber removal contracts will be adjusted according to conditions.  The Forest Service recognizes the economic complexities surrounding removal of deteriorating timber in a timely manner, especially when combined with limited operating periods and weather constraints. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 171. AFRC Comment: Meet your snag requirements by grouping snags, utilizing snags from untreated areas, etc. Response: While snag requirements are met across the landscape, at the project level snag retention does play a role in individual wildlife habitat requirements. As standing snags will not be retained when posing an imminent danger to public safety, snags leaning away from the road or on the outskirts of treatment areas (contributing to "groups" outside of treatment areas) will be favored for retention. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 172. AFRC Comment: Make sure you highlight the small percentage of the fire area that will actually be treated. Response: The scale of the proposed treatments will be compared to the area burned in the 2015 fires. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 173. AFRC Comment: Try to not have any, at least minimize to the extent possible, limited operating periods. They will have the greatest effect on the ability to efficiently and effectively remove salvage material. Response: The Forest is considering modifying limited operating periods and is discussing options with the Fish and Wildlife Service and Forest Service specialists. The effects of modified limited operating periods will be analyzed in chapter 3 of the EIS. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 174. AFRC Comment: Utilize the Regional Salvage Guidelines. Response: The proposed action includes the retention of all live and dying trees at time of implementation. Other alternatives may be analyzed that include removal of fire-injured trees with a high probability of mortality, as requested by other interested parties including AFRC ("utilize Regional Salvage Guidelines"). The Regional Salvage Guidelines refers to the Forest Service Publication Marking Guidelines for Fire-injured Trees in California (Smith and Cluck 2011) which provides scientifically-based direction in identifying trees with a high probability of mortality based on crown scorch, cambium injury and insect evidence during post-fire salvage operations. Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #11. Issue statement: The proposed action only proposes to remove trees that are dead at the time of implementation, but this does not address all of the trees that will die from fire damage, which means the treatments do not fully address the Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage hazard; analyze an alternative that would remove dying trees as well as dead trees, consistent with the Region 5 Hazard Tree Guidelines and the Region 5 Fire Injured Tree Guidelines. 175. AFRC Comment: We have a serious concern about the consultation process that will need to occur with the FWS, NMFS, and the State Water Board. We understand you are planning to bring them along from the start of the process. There will be nothing hidden and they will be kept abreast of your proposed actions. By doing so you are hopeful there will be no surprises. While this is the best approach and sounds good during initial planning it doesn't always work that way. The Klamath National Forest learned this the hard way. They incorporated all of these agencies from the beginning just as you are planning. Discussions were ongoing throughout the entire process but near the end the agencies begin to balk at the proposed action catching the Forest completely by surprise. STAY ALERT! Response: The Forest did initiate contact with the consulting agencies very early in the project development process, and we will continue to maintain close communication and coordination with these agencies with the intent of being proactive about the consultation process. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 176. AFRC Comment: Please keep AFRC current on the progress of your project planning.[...]We are also very interested in any field trips and public meetings that will be held for this project. Response: Public scoping was completed in December 2015. AFRC is on our project mailing list and will be informed of public meetings and field trips. The offer for design and logging system assistance will be considered. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 177. AFRC Comment: We will be happy to provide field support on design and logging systems if so desired. Response: Public scoping was completed in December 2015. AFRC is on our project mailing list and will be informed of public meetings and field trips. The offer for design and logging system assistance will be considered. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 178. TLC Comment: Reduce Hazards: Fire Killed Trees and Excessive Fuels that threaten public and firefighter safety along forest system, county and state roads. In order to minimize the threat to the public and provide for firefighter safety it is crucial to perpetually maintain all roads to a level that shall provide safety from future fires. This shall include executing the project to a level of fire resilience and protection to all adjacent resource values. Allowing the valuable resource and fuels to remain on the landscape for years is not beneficial concerning public and firefighter safety. Response: The purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. This is consistent with Forest Plan direction to a) provide for public safety and protection of structures by managing fuel loading, distribution and arrangement within Wildland Urban Interface for low flame lengths and rate of spread (4-18), b) remove danger/hazard trees (4-26), and c) perform road maintenance activities to meet a variety of Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage management objectives. Not all roads will be maintained every year due to the maintenance level assigned by management, use, and other factors (4-16). This project involves reducing hazards along all open roads affected by the 2015 fires to improve safety during ingress and egress in the event of a fire. More intensive treatments along these roads will be considered under alternatives to the proposed action. The Forest Service does not have the financial and personnel capability to maintain every mile of road as a fuelbreak, which is what would be required to provide fire resilience and protection to all adjacent resource values. The Forest strives to provide a safe road system for public use of National Forest System Lands; this project would address hazardous conditions within the area that burned in the 2015 fires. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action 179. TLC Comment: Capture the economic value of timber and support local communities by providing forest products in order to maximize the monetary value of timber and support local communities the process of preparing an Environmental Impact Statement shall be expedited. The timeline of an Environmental Impact Statement is a concern that the proposed project will not quickly recover the monetary value of wood through salvage and sale. The monetary value of wood value is decreasing daily as the wood deteriorates and the degradation process will accelerate as the temperatures increase and insect cycles intensify. In order to quickly recover the economic value this project needs to be fully executed and operated by early summer 2016. Therefore we urge the Shasta Trinity National Forest to pursue other environmental processes and or avenues in order to quickly recover the monetary value of timber and potentially develop a viable salvage project. Response: The Forest recognizes the importance of timely implementation of this project in order to capture any economic value still remaining in these dead trees. Removal of larger dead trees while they can pay for themselves instead of requiring appropriated funding to treat is definitely the most efficient and productive way of dealing with the excessive fuels and hazards left after these wildfire events. While federal and agency regulations regarding the NEPA process for analysis must be followed, the Forest is committed to expediting the processes as much as possible by utilizing tight analysis deadlines, concurrent reviews by collaborating specialists and concurrent collaboration with regulatory agencies. The proposed action is likely to have significant impacts so it must be analyzed under an EIS. Implementation of this project in early summer is not possible due to required steps (specialist analysis, consultation with regulatory agencies, public comment periods and responses, etc.) under NEPA and ESA. Consequently, recognizing timber deterioration began while the fire was active and will continue, merchantability specifications will be adjusted accordingly, based on existing conditions at time of implementation. Other projects may consider additional salvage opportunities. Issue Disposition: Already decided by law, regulation, or policy 180. SPI Comment: The Forest sub-committee of the Trinity Collaborative recently presented a blue-print for a proposed project "From Fire-killed to Shaded Fuel Break". This proposal focuses on rehabilitation and restoration of a strip of burned timberland adjacent to public roads with the 5 complexes of fires and the additional fires near Weaverville affecting the Shasta Trinity, BLM and Six Rivers Forests. The key element is moving those burned acres into a future desired condition of a shaded fuel break along those roads. Those desired future conditions provide protection to infrastructure, access for management and a logical anchor to use for future firefighting or prescribed burning. We believe private property adjacent to public lands within the burned area of the complexes should be treated in a similar manner with a desired future condition of a shaded fuel break adjacent to the public/private property line border. We request the same measures being proposed for implementation along roads be incorporated into a second Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage project that is implemented along the public/private land borders. With the public lands carrying an ever increasing amount of biomass, private lands adjacent to over-crowded public lands are in the cross-hairs of each fire incident. Long term management of our public forest that move them towards a condition of increasing fire resiliency is a prime objective at both the Forest and National levels. The recent fires are an example of the impacts public land fires can have on private property. Sierra Pacific Industries had fire go through almost 2000 acres of our properties within Trinity County. We had mortality in over 1000 acres of existing plantations to the extent that we have to start those acres over. While we invest in restoring our property we are surrounded by dead trees and an incredibly high fuel load on public lands.[...]In summary the private landowner is greatly affected by public land decisions and fire policies. We request that you direct your staff to prepare and analyze for your proposed projects within the burned areas of Trinity County a project that encompasses the public/private property line borders and implements the "Fire-killed to Shaded Fuel Break" actions along those property lines. Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. Other projects may be proposed to treat fuel loading along private-public land boundaries. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project 181. SPI Comment: From a global view, the private reforested lands are leading to long term greater onsite sequestration of carbon, significant off-site climate benefits in the form of long term storage in products and the production of carbon free power in biomass cogeneration. These atmospheric benefits alone warrant great valuation, and therefore we believe the risk to private land values is equal to or higher than the risk to public values along roads. Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads; and to sustain and establish forest cover. Treatment along the private land/Forest Service boundary are outside the scope of this proposed action, but would be considered in other projects that treat within 2015 wildfire perimeters along private and public land boundaries. Effects of this project on climate change, greenhouse gasses, and carbon sequestration will be included in chapter 3 of the EIS. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project 182. SPI Comment: While the Trinity Collaborative recommended 300', 300-600 feet along the private/public land boundaries would allow for more effective fire suppression. Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. Other projects may be proposed to treat fuel loading along private-public land boundaries. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project 183. Wilkinson, Bill Comment: Although you describe the many miles of road being proposed for use for the project, I didn't see an element that described how roads would be prepared for use, maintained/upgraded, and treated post-harvest. In particular we have specific concerns about the Underwood Mountain Road from Burnt Ranch to Hyampom, and the Denny Rd. from Hawkins Bar to Denny.[...] Our Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage landowners (Trinity Timberlands, LLC) through our company, were required by the USFS to conduct extensive upgrades and maintenance on the Pelletreau Ridge Road for salvage efforts we conducted there this fall. We expect the USFS and its contractors to be held to at least an equally high standard as we were. Such efforts are not cheap and will lower timber stumpage rates considerably, but leaving roads in good condition is a primary responsibility associated with sustainable forest management, and we expect the USFS to represent the highest level of commitment to this goal. Response: The fire suppression repair process and the Burned Area Emergency Response process both addressed road condition issues in the burned area. Forest Service roads used during fire suppression will be maintained at the appropriate level for their projected use. Some roads fall under cost-share agreements, in which case the Forest would contribute to the maintenance of those roads. County roads that are not included in cost-share agreements are the responsibility of the County to maintain. Roads used for implementation of this project would be maintained to the appropriate Forest Service standard. Issue Disposition: Consistent with the Proposed Action 184. Wilkinson, Bill Comment: These sections of road, including the portion of the Underwood Mtn. Rd. that is county road, took a real beating during fire suppression efforts (which, by the way, we really appreciate -the efforts, not the road damage). We expect the USFS to make a point of contributing to the rehabilitation and upgrading of damaged roads resulting from suppression efforts as well as new impacts from fire salvage. We would like the USFS to prioritize rehabilitation of the county portion of the Underwood Mtn. Rd as well as the subsequent 5 miles of USFS road toward Hyampom which local residents use to access their properties, as well as the Denny Rd. in the immediate area of Hawkins Bar and on into the community of Denny. These areas are vital to the local community and are not in good shape now, and we expect that USFS to leave them in a much better condition than they presently are Response: The fire suppression repair process and the Burned Area Emergency Response process both addressed road condition issues in the burned area. Forest Service roads used during fire suppression will be maintained at the appropriate level for their projected use. Some roads fall under cost-share agreements, in which case the Forest would contribute to the maintenance of those roads. County roads that are not included in cost-share agreements are the responsibility of the County to maintain. Roads used for implementation of this project would be maintained to the appropriate Forest Service standard. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project 185. Wilkinson, Bill Comment: Another minor comment is that I thought your proposed planting spacing of 18-30 feet was too low for stands that are planned for future timber management. A spacing of 12'x12' is typical of planting of logged areas in this area, and as you know some trees can be expected not to survive, so more trees need to be planted than are typical of stocking of a mature stand. Response: While 12x12 is typical (and often past practices promoted even denser plantations), the long-term goal of these roadside areas is to promote conditions suitable for a shaded fuelbreak, and therefore wider spacing than what is typical for managed stands is appropriate in this situation. Spacing will vary based on conditions. Additional reforestation efforts (beyond roadside areas proposed for treatment under this analysis) many be considered under a separate project analysis. See Comment/Response #109 for more information regarding planting species mix, including ponderosa pine. Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #13. Issue Statement: The proposed planting density is too low; therefore, analyze an alternative that would have a heavier planting density. 186. Wilkinson, Bill Comment: I'm sorry we were not able to attend the public meeting in Burnt Ranch. Please keep us apprised of future developments and avenues for involvement in the planning and implementation of these projects. I'm copying this email to my wife's email address if you'd like to keep in touch with use both via email. Response: The commenters have been added to the project mailing list and will be informed of any opportunities to comment as the project planning proceeds. Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 187. Wilson, Karen Comment: The title of the project includes hazard reduction and salvage. In reading the proposed Project information online, it is unclear whether this Project is a: Roadside Hazard Removal project, Non-Roadside Hazard Reduction project Green Tree project, Salvage project, Fuelbreak project, or Shaded Fuelbreak project. Please clarify. Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. The proposed action does not include treatment of areas outside of the roadside buffer (maximum 300-feet total width). The proposed action would only treat dead trees. Healthy and dying green trees would not be treated under this analysis. Where dead trees are in sufficient quantity and quality to provide commercial value, they would be sold in a salvage timber sale. For a fuelbreak to be effective at reducing fire behavior, it must be contiguous, wider than the treatments proposed in the proposed action, and strategically located (not all roads are in areas that would be strategic for fuelbreaks). The nature of the fire impact is spotty, meaning that many areas along the road burned at very low severity. To create a fuelbreak would require treatment of green vegetation in these low severity areas; the proposed action would only treat dead vegetation. Fuelbreak creation and maintenance will be considered in alternatives. Issue Disposition: Asks a question that can be answered succinctly in the analysis or response to comments 188. Wilson, Karen Comment: * Hazard reduction/removal project? I understand the Project proposes to reduce downed logs greater than 3" in diameter to 10-20 tons/acre and reduce dead brush by 50-100%. Would this happen in a minimum or maximum corridor of 300 feet along roads? Or, would this happen within all severely burned areas also? Response: The proposed action includes reduction of hazards (hazardous trees and heavy fuel loading) within a buffer that is a maximum of 300 feet wide. Fuels reduction away from roads is not being considered in this project; it is beyond the scope of the purpose and need. It may be considered in other projects in the future. The proposed action includes fuel reduction treatments in the road buffer that would reduce fuels greater than 3" in diameter to 10-20 tons per acre and a reduction of dead brush. Issue Disposition: Asks a question that can be answered succinctly in the analysis or response to comments Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage 189. Wilson, Karen Comment: Removing dead or hazardous trees in a corridor along roads would add to fire resilience as well as provide for safety to people. It would seem important to do this as soon as possible while protecting resources. Is this the aspect that needs an Emergency Situation Determination? Response: An Emergency Situation Determination was considered earlier in the planning process but is not being pursued at this time. Issue Disposition: Asks a question that can be answered succinctly in the analysis or response to comments 190. Wilson, Karen Comment: * Green Tree project? Salvage project? Implications that this is proposed as a Green Tree project are found in the areas shown in purple showing "potential commercial opportunities." In the areas I am most familiar with, it appears these are all in LSRs and would need a full EIS under NEPA. The time it would take for that analysis and the limited operating periods would preclude accomplishing the hazard reduction in a timely manner. Response: Due to the size and complexity of the proposed action (hazard tree and fuel loading reduction, and associated log removal) and potential effects, the National Environmental Policy Act regulations require completion of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Issue Disposition: Procedural concern 191. Wilson, Karen Comment: Timber sale along 128 miles of road. What does that mean? Green trees? Black trees? What is Salvage? Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. The proposed action does not include treatment of areas outside of the roadside buffer (maximum 300-feet total width). The proposed action would only treat dead trees. Healthy and dying green trees would not be treated under this alternative. Where dead trees are in sufficient quantity and quality to provide commercial value, they would be sold in a salvage timber sale. It is estimated that there are approximately 128 miles of the roads proposed that these conditions exist for large salvage timber sales. Issue Disposition: Asks a question that can be answered succinctly in the analysis or response to comments 192. Wilson, Karen Comment: * Fuelbreak project? Enclosed please find a well-researched, comprehensive, and still up-to-date Report on a Literature Search Pertaining to Fuelbreaks and Fire Behavior, by Kenneth C. Baldwin For Trinity RCD Council. I suggest that an evaluation of fire behavior during the 2015 Trinity Fires, especially as it relates to existing Fuelbreaks, be added to the literature on the subject. Were existing fuelbreaks (prior to fires) regularly maintained? At what time intervals? Please show existing fuelbreaks on maps. Response: The fuels report will discuss fire behavior during the 2015 wildfires on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The fuels report will discuss the expected fire behavior under each alternative out 20 years from implementation. The proposed action is not designed to function as a strategic fuelbreak and so the effectiveness of past fuelbreaks on the 2015 wildfires is outside of Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage the scope of this analysis. We agree that maintaining fuels treatments is an important contributor to their effectiveness and as a result Fuel Treatment Maintenance is part of the proposed action. Issue Disposition: Asks a question that can be answered succinctly in the analysis or response to comments 193. Wilson, Karen Comment: Since fire resilience is desired, please be aware of the recommendations made by Prof. James K. Agee, April 25, 2008 Klamath Fire Ecology Conference in Orleans, CA, that fuels treatments most likely to create fire resilience in the mixed-fire regime forests of the Klamath Mountains are, in order: (1) Reduce surface fuels (2) Increase canopy base height (3) Keep the big trees (4) Reduce canopy density Shaded Fuelbreaks need less maintenance, and are most effective. In severely burned areas, shade is not possible, so please provide for more frequent maintenance if not shaded. Does this project include fuelbreaks? Response: The proposed action includes reducing surface fuels and standing dead fuels (when they pose a hazard) in a buffer along open roads. The proposed action only includes treatment of dead vegetation, which would occur primarily in the moderate and high severity burned areas where the canopy has been mostly, if not entirely, removed; therefore, there is not canopy to treat for increasing base height or decreasing canopy density. All live large trees would be retained in the proposed action. Fuelbreaks are not included in the proposed action. To be effective, fuelbreaks must be contiguous (which requires treatment of green vegetation including the suggested treatments in the comment), they must be wider than the buffer in the proposed action, and they must be placed strategically (not all roads are in strategic locations for fuelbreaks). The development of fuelbreaks will be considered in alternatives to the proposed action. Issue Disposition: Alternative Driving Issue #7. Future high severity fire is a concern in the project area which will not be addressed by the proposed action; therefore, analyze an alternative that includes effective shaded fuelbreaks. 194. Wilson, Karen Comment: * Summary Hazard reduction/removal and Reducing surface fuels are the most important steps. It is hoped that these can be done with an economic return to communities in a timely manner. Response: Due to the size and complexity of the proposed action (hazard tree and fuel loading reduction, and associated log removal) and potential effects, the National Environmental Policy Act regulations require completion of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The Forest is pursuing potential avenues to shorten the typical EIS timeline. Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement 195. Wilson, Karen Comment: In addition to safety and fire resilience, please consider waterbars and other measures necessary for water quality, as a result of fire suppression activities, in case they were not addressed before the current winter 2015-16. These will be important for years because of potential erosion in the burned areas, whether they are planted soon or not. Water quality is critical for the health of all aspects of the forests, including timber production. Response: Fire suppression repair and Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) efforts have addressed some of these issues directly, by repairing some of the suppression impacts, including installing water bars, and making improvements to the road system in the burned area. The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage State roads. Resource protection measures and Best Management Practices designed to protect water quality will be required within the area treated in the project. Additional mitigations in the watersheds that were most impacted by fire are also being considered. Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project (repairing fire suppression damage), consistent with the proposed action (including waterbars and other water quality protection measures in areas where the project is implemented). Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage APPENDIX C – BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES The National BMP Program was developed to improve agency performance and accountability in managing water quality consistent with the Federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and State water quality programs. Current Forest Service policy directs compliance with required CWA permits and State regulations and requires the use of BMPs to control nonpoint source pollution to meet applicable water quality standards and other CWA requirements. These BMPs enable the agency to readily document compliance with the nonpoint source management strategy at national and regional scales. The following selected BMPs are expected to apply to this project. Not every BMP will apply in every circumstance, however the expectation is that where applicable, the following BMPs shall be implemented. Veg-2.

The purpose of this report is to comply with this requirement by summarizing the known sediment sources that lie within the proposed boundaries and along the haul routes of the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage project. The Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements for Nonpoint Source Discharges Related to Certain Federal Land Management Activities on NFS Lands in the North Coast Region (“Waiver”) addresses nonpoint source discharges of waste to waters of California from activities associated with specific uses of NFS lands (Cal. EPA North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board. 2015). The Waiver requires that all legacy sediment sites for this project must be identified, inventoried, prioritized, scheduled and implemented for treatment as a part of the project activities. The inventory is required to be submitted to the Regional Water Board during project development. This report will be submitted to the Regional Water Board to comply with this requirement. The Waiver acknowledges that some projects may be so large that it is infeasible or unnecessary to treat all legacy sediment sites. In such cases, alternative legacy sediment site treatment plans that inventory and propose to treat some portion of the largest sediment producing sites within the project area may be submitted to the Executive Officer of the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board (Water Board) for approval. The Water Board has agreed that an alternative legacy sediment site treatment plan is appropriate for this project (Maggie Robinson, Water Board Engineering Geologist, written communication). Therefore, the Forest Service proposes to treat only the high and moderate-high risk features within the project area, and the high risk features along the haul routes. These treatments, along with descriptions of past legacy sediment site treatments and restoration efforts implemented in the same sub-watersheds (HUC 6) within the past twenty years will be submitted to the Water Board as part of an alternative legacy sediment site treatment plan. Watersheds that are over the threshold of concern (TOC) are not to be further impacted unless they can be improved with appropriate mitigation measures (Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan, page 4-25). Hyampom and Sulphur Glade-Waldorf Flat sub-watersheds are over TOC. Decommissioning Forest Service system roads, restoring non-system roads, and upgrading system roads are common mitigation measures. Non-system roads in Hyampom and Sulphur Glade-Waldorf Flat that have been identified for restoration to comply with the mitigation requirement for this project are identified in this report. Closed roads in Hyampom that have been identified for decommissioning or improvment are identified in this report. Road reconstruction will occur as necessary to comply with the Waiver and Forest Plan mitigation requirements. Actions can include surface improvement; construction of drainage dips, culverts, riprap fills or other drainage or stabilization features with potential disturbance outside the established roadway (toe of fill to top of cut); and realignment. Sediment Source Inventory (SSI) reports used to compile this information include: NSR 2011 (Lower Hayfork Creek, Middle South Fork Trinity River, Upper Hayfork Creek and Upper South Fork Trinity River), NRM 2012 (Burnt Ranch), NRM 2012 (New River), NSR 2012 (Browns Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Creek, Canyon Creek, Lower Hayfork Creek, Lower South Fork Trinity River and Upper Hayfork Creek). Sites identified in the SSI reports are provided for each subwatershed (HUC 6). Not all sites identified in the SSI reports are significant sources of sediment. Focus in this report is placed on high risk and moderate-high risk features. Some road decommissioning and improvement projects have been implemented within the proposed project area after the SSI reports were completed. In 2012 and 2013, the Trinity County Resource Conservation District (TCRCD) completed some road-related projects that lie within the proposed project area. Numerous improvements have been completed with BAER funds after the 2015 fires. Finally, some improvements have been completed by the Forest Service under routine maintenance projects. Not all of the improvements have been identified in this report. Sediment Source Inventory South Fork Trinity River Forest Service roads in the South Fork Trinity River subbasin were inventoried in 2011 and 2012 by North State Resources, Inc. (NSR, 2011; NSR, 2012). Lower Hayfork CreekRisk ratings of the roads in Lower Hayfork Creek that were inventoried by NSR in 2012 and lie within (or partially within) the proposed project boundaries are identified in Table D-1, and are shown in Maps 1 and 2. Specific recommendations for the moderate-high to high risk roads are described in Table D-2. High and moderate-high risk features that lie within the proposed project boundaries, and high risk features that lie along the haul routes are identified in Table D-3. Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Table D-1.

It is a gully located on road 33N68 (Map D-1-1). The risk was rated high because it compromises access to the route. However, it is not hydrologically connected (Table D-2), so it should not be considered a high risk as a source of sediment to any nearby stream. In Grassy Flat-Miners Creek, there are numerous high and moderate-high risk features, including eleven corrugated metal pipe (CMP) stream crossings, six connected CMPs, three connected cross drains, three gullies, three ditches, and a spring (Table D-3). These features are located on roads 33N68, 3N05, 4N04, 4N24 and 5N60 (Map D-1-1). On roads 4N24 and 5N60, BAER funds were used after the 2015 fires to improve six of the CMP stream crossings (E29, E30, E32, E45, E47, and E48).

there are numerous high and moderate-high risk features on roads 4N24, 4N25, 4N41, 4N41A, 4N48A, and 5N50 (Table D-6 and Map D-1-1). On road 4N24, BAER funds were used to improve three stream crossing CMPs after the 2015 fires. The remaining identified high and moderate-high risk features include: ten stream crossing CMPs, 21 connected CMPs, one connected cross drain, 38 ditches, and one erosion feature. Reconstruction of these roads to fix these remaining features will occur to comply with the Waiver. A watershed analysis has not yet been completed for Eltapom Creek, which is required for Riparian Reserves prior to determining how proposed land management activities meet Aquatic Conservation Strategy objectives. There is no proposed project area within Riparian Reserves in Eltapom Creek, but there are haul routes within Riparian Reserves. A focused watershed analysis addressing road construction and repairs in Riparian Reserves will be completed for Eltapom Creek before the improvements on haul routes in Riparian Reserves are implemented. In Hyampom, there are two inventoried high risk features – a connected CMP and a ditch on road 4N24 (Table D-6 and Map D-1-3). Reconstruction of this road to fix the identified high risk features will occur to comply with the Waiver. Some project roads in Hyampom were inspected by a Forest Service civil engineer between September, 2013 and April, 2014 (Table D-7). Maintenance and upgrade activities have been completed except for the culvert replacements on road 3N14 at mile 1.0 and 1.7. These two culverts (Map D-1-3, ID tags E50 and E51) will be replaced to comply with the Waiver. Table D-7.

Inventoried roads in the proposed project area to be upgraded include 4N04 and 4N24 (Table D-4), and road 3N14 at mile 1.0 and 1.7(Table D-7). There are about 2 miles of unauthorized roads to be decommissioned (Table D-8 and Map D-1-3). There are about 4 miles of closed roads to be decommissioned (Table D-9 and Map D-1-3); these roads are being analyzed in a separate NEPA project, but will be used as mitigation for this project. There are about 21 miles of closed roads that will have the culverts removed (Table D-10 and Map D-1-3).

In Eltapom Creek, road 4N11 has not been inventoried. There are no stream crossings in the project area on road 4N11, so no high risk features are expected; therefore, only routine maintenance will occur on this road in the project area. In Hyampom, roads 3N30 and 6N01 have not been inventoried; these roads do not cross any streams or Riparian Reserves (Map D-1-3) and are not expected to have any moderate-high to high risk features. Middle South Fork Trinity RiverMiddle South Fork Trinity River was inventoried for sediment sources by NSR in 2011.

These features are located on roads 1S04, 1S06, 1S20, and 4N12. Reconstruction of these roads to fix the identified high risk features will occur to comply with the Waiver. In Rattlesnake Creek-Post Mountain, there is one high risk feature – a connected CMP on road 30N29.  This feature will be fixed to comply with the Waiver. In Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat, there is one high risk feature – a stream crossing CMP on road 4N12. This feature will be fixed to comply with the Waiver. Some Forest Service roads in the project area in Middle South Fork Trinity River have not been inventoried. In Rattlesnake Creek-Post Mountain, roads 29N68, 30N28, 30N29A and 30N46 have not been inventoried. In Sulphur Glade-Waldorf Flat, road 2N43 has not been inventoried; there are no stream crossings on this road in the proposed project area, so the road will not be inspected before the Waiver application is submitted. There are no Forest Service roads in Cave Creek-Miller Springs that have not been inventoried. 480 Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage In Sulphur Glade-Waldorf Flat, depending upon which alternative is selected in the record of decision, mitigation may be required to comply with the Forest Plan. It is estimated that about three miles of road decommissioning (or an equivalent amount of some other type of improvement project) is required if the Proposed Action is implemented. About 3.2 miles of non-system roads will be decommissioned to implement the Proposed Action (Table D-13 and Map D1-3). Medium risk CMP stream crossings within the proposed project area that could be fixed include five on road 3N10 located at mile posts 1.190, 1.254, 1.915, 3.671 and 3.708; and three on road 6N01 located at mile posts 44.856, 44.914 and 44.934. Roads that are outside the proposed project area that could be improved to comply with required mitigation include inventoried Forest Service roads. There are no inventoried high risk roads outside the proposed project area in Sulphur Glade-Waldorf Creek, but there are about 28 miles of medium risk roads, including: 1N16, 2N25, 2N27, 2N60, 3N10, 3N19, 3N27 and 4N12 (Map D-1-3). Table D-13.

These features are located on roads 30N01, 30N16, 30N16E, 30N16F, and 30N47 (Map D-1-5). Reconstruction of these roads to fix the identified high and moderate-high risk features will occur to comply with the Waiver. There are no Forest Service roads in the proposed project area in Browns Creek that have not been inventoried. Burnt Ranch Risk ratings of the roads in Burnt Ranch that were inventoried by NRM and lie within (or partially within) the proposed project boundaries are identified in Table D-21. There are no roads located within the proposed project area that were rated at high risk. 489 Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Table D-21.

Road 6N42 was considered to be not at risk, and it was recommended that the road be retained. In Burnt Ranch Gorge, roads 4N22 and 5N09 were recommended to be upgraded, but the risk for both roads was considered to be medium. Road 5N19 was considered to be not at risk, and it was recommended that the road be retained. Several roads have not been inventoried that lie within the proposed project area in Burnt Ranch. In Big French Creek, roads 5N13 and 6N04 have not been inventoried. In Burnt Ranch Gorge, road 5N60 has not been inventoried. In Don Juan Creek, road 5N04 has not been inventoried. Upgrades were made to roads 5N13, 6N04, and 5N04 with BAER funds after the 2015 fires; therefore, there is no plan to further inventory these roads. There are no stream crossings on the section of road 5N60 that has not been inventoried, so it will not be inspected before the Waiver application is submitted. Canyon CreekThere is only one road in the proposed project area in Canyon Creek (Map D-1-6). Road 32N25 lies in Lower Canyon Creek and has not been inventoried. There are no stream crossings on this road in the project area, so it will not be inspected for high risk features. Only routine maintenance will be proposed for this road in the Waiver application. New River Priority ratings of the roads in New River that were inventoried by NRM and lie within (or partially within) the proposed project boundaries are identified in Table D-22. High priority roads include 7N03B in Upper New River and 7N03C in Devils Canyon due to undersized pipes (Table D-22.)

Upgrades were made to roads 5N13 and 7N26 after the 2015 fires with BAER funds; therefore, these two roads will not be inspected prior to the submittal of the Waiver application. Also, road 7N53 will not be inspected because there are no stream crossings in the proposed project area, Roads 5N18 and 6N04 will be inspected prior to submittal of the Waiver application. In Devils Canyon, there are no roads in the proposed project area that have not been inventoried. Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Figure D-1 Map showing the location of undersized pipes on roads 7N03B and 7N03C. Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage References California Environmental Protection Agency, North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board. 2011.

Effects of Treatments in relations to Aquatic Conservation Strategy (ACS) objectives Aquatic Conservation Strategy Objectives  Effect of treatments from the various action alternatives in relation to the ACS  1.) Maintain and restore the distribution, diversity, and complexity of watershed and landscape-scale features to ensure protection of the aquatic systems to which species, populations and communities are uniquely adapted.  Existing Condition:  The 2015 fires burned ten watersheds (HUC5) that have proposed hazard tree removal. Three watersheds (Upper Hayfork, New River & Lower Hayfork) had more than 5% of the watershed burn at moderate and high severities combined (11, 8 & 6 percent respectively), while all other watersheds had smaller areas burned within them. While the wildfire significantly affected portions of these watersheds, most of the later seral vegetation that provides watershed diversity and complexity in the watersheds is retained in all of the watersheds. Portions that burned at low severities or that didn’t burn within the fire perimeter are actually considered to have greater diversity and complexity within the watersheds with new vegetative growth and reduced ground fuels since the fires decreased the presence of small twigs and branches that typically carry fires which has also helped to break up fuel bed continuity.  The natural successional processes that commence literally as soon as the heat subsides has contributed to increased complexity and diversity. Refer to ACS Objective 8 for a description of effects at smaller hydrologic unit scales that better correlate to potential changes in stream reaches and site specific changes on the landscape.  Existing and Future Activities – (not including this project) Dead and dying trees on private lands are assumed to be harvested in all areas that burned at a moderate or high severity and are considered to be clear cut. It is expected that these privately harvested areas will be reforested more rapidly than adjacent federal lands due to the aggressive reforestation programs implemented on private lands; which typically includes the use of herbicides. The USFS is also planning a reforestation project which will not include the use of herbicides, so vegetation is expected to recover at a much slower rate on the public lands.  The different rates of recovery also contribute to greater vegetative diversity and stand structures that are increasing complexity across the burned portions of the watersheds. This hazard tree removal project, is expected to create a safer environment for implementing the  509 Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Aquatic Conservation Strategy Objectives  Effect of treatments from the various action alternatives in relation to the ACS  reforestation projects on private and public lands by keeping roads open and safer to travel.   Felling and possible hauling of hazard trees will not disrupt recovery processes. Fuels reduction will promote more rapid healing of intermediate to long term successional recovery by preventing or reducing the scope and magnitude of future conflagration-level wildfires, particularly in riparian areas. Proposed road improvement work and closures are expected to reduce up to 30,000 cubic yards of sedimentation by treating legacy road problem sites; this will help protect aquatic ecosystems which could otherwise be adversely affected or virtually eliminated for many acres and miles if these legacy sites were not ‘defused’ of their threat. Regardless of the alternative selected, there will be no appreciable impact on the physical and biotic features captured by this Objective. Cumulative watershed effects results documented in the hydrology section of the EIS confirm such, at the larger scales. Therefore, Project implementation via selection of any action alternative will maintain and promote attainment of this ACS objective at the watershed and project site scale (aided greatly by Project EEZs, BMPs, and RPMs.  2.) Maintain and restore spatial and temporal connectivity within and between watersheds. Lateral, longitudinal, and drainage network connections include floodplains, wetlands, upslope areas, headwater tributaries, and intact refugia. These network connections must provide chemically and physically unobstructed routes to areas critical for fulfilling life history requirements of aquatic and riparian-dependent species.  Existing Conditions:  The 2015 wildfires burned portions of many ridgetops that severed vegetative connectivity between watersheds. Portions of riparian reserves that burned at moderate and high severities have also lost the continuity of shading along the streams over the short term.   However, over the long term the trees killed along the riparian reserves will contribute woody debris to streams that is expected to aid in metering sediment through the stream system and will likely to contribute to the development of desirable aquatic habitats. The longitudinal connectivity between watersheds and the drainage networks have fewer impacts from the 2015 fires and more significant impacts from historic mining activities with tailing piles stacked in significant portions of historic floodplains that have dramatically decreased flood prone areas along the larger rivers.  In addition the legacy road networks have also impeded drainage continuity at stream crossings. Existing and Future Activities – (not including this project) The reforestation projects of private and public lands will help to restore the continuity in vegetation along streams restoring the thermal insulation along the streams, which will take roughly 30 years to develop shading to pre-fire conditions. This hazard tree removal project includes active fuels treatments done to decrease the frequency and probability of serious future intense wildfires which promote the essence of this ACS objective. Major  510 Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Aquatic Conservation Strategy Objectives  Effect of treatments from the various action alternatives in relation to the ACS  disruptions to connectivity may be decreased for terrestrial and aquatic habitat-dependent organisms. Felling of hazard trees into stream channels when growing within 150 feet of streams can create minor physical obstructions, or even promote deposition of additional wood pieces, but such large wood ‘jams’ are a natural part of a healthy stream ecosystem. Such wood can collect fine sediments above their temporary dams and create large pools on occasion. Often fish spawning gravels deposit at the upper end of these pools. Prevention of large legacy road sedimentation catastrophes also prevents site by site aquatic connectivity severing and disruption. If any of the untreated legacy sites later became a physical barrier to aquatic organisms, then their treatment will instead promote continued connectivity. Stream crossing upgrades are a connected action associated with the implementation of this project. Treating legacy road sites that are considered existing or potential sediment sourcesthat are required as part of the North Coast Water Board Waiver are likely to improve stream bed and woody debris transport at stream crossings which restores streambed continuity. Project implementation via any of the action alternatives could help to promote recovery in areas as described above and will not prevent attainment of this ACS objective at the Project site scale(aided greatly by Project EEZs, BMPs, and RPMs), and meets the objective at the landscape scale and in the intermediate to long-term.  3.) Maintain and restore the physical integrity of the aquatic system, including shorelines, banks, and bottom configurations.  Existing Conditions:  The wildfires of 2015 resulted in increased erosion and sedimentation to the watersheds affected by this project. The South Fork Trinity River and Hayfork Creek which were most disturbed by the wildfires are under a TMDL (EPA 1998) to reduce the excess sediment loads that are adversely affecting the cold water fisheries including coho and fall run Chinook salmon and steelhead trout. Road improvements associated with the BAER treatments helped to significantly decrease the erosion and sedimentation associated with the fire by reducing risks of failure at stream crossings and reducing road erosion that was accelerated by the fires. Existing and Future Activities – (not including this project) The reforestation projects on private and public lands will help to stabilize the watersheds over the long term, providing mature vegetation within the next 30 years. This hazard tree removal project includes Felling hazard trees within 150 feet of streams into or toward streams to reside in place which helps restore the physical integrity of aquatic ecosystems directly by providing improved habitats through changes in bottom configurations  511 Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Aquatic Conservation Strategy Objectives  Effect of treatments from the various action alternatives in relation to the ACS  (often by creating pools) and by providing energy through wood decomposition via insect contribution to the water column. The associated fuels treatments will help maintain proper riparian habitat functions by preventing future large-scale riparian mortality. Prevention of large sedimentation disasters through legacy road site treatments will also maintain the physical integrity of aquatic habitat. Peak and base flows will not appreciably change via Project implementation so aquatic habitat will not differ from background at any time of the year after Project implementation. Project implementation via any of the action alternatives will not prevent attainment of this ACS objective at the Project site scale or in the short term (aided greatly by Project EEZs, BMPs, and RPMs), and meets the objective at the landscape scale and in the intermediate to long-term.  4.) Maintain and restore water quality necessary to support healthy riparian, aquatic, and wetland ecosystems. Water quality must remain within the range that maintains the biological, physical, and chemical integrity of the system and benefits survival, growth, reproduction, and migration of individuals composing aquatic and riparian communities.  Existing Conditions: The South Fork Trinity River is included on California’s Clean Water Act section 303(d) list for sediment and temperature impairment and has a TMDL in place (EPA 1998). The mainstem Trinity River is on the same list for sediment and mercury and has a sediment TMDL in place as well (EPA 2001). The New River watershed which is a tributary to the main stem Trinity River is designated as a Key Watershed in the SHF LRMP and is considered as high quality habitat providing refugia for aquatic species.  It is also considered a reference watershed that was utilized to set the TMDL and is clear of mercury issues. The 2015 wildfires delayed the water quality recovery of the portions of the watersheds that burned at high and moderate burn severities yielding higher than normal peak flows and elevated erosion and sedimentation rates, as well as a decrease in thermal cover for sections of streams. Existing and Future Activities – (not including this project) The reforestation projects on private and public lands will help to restore watersheds, which should promote improved water quality over the next 30 years as mature forests again redevelop. Water quality ‘indicators’ that could potentially be affected by Project implementation are temperature, suspended sediment, chemical contamination, and water quantity via water drafting or peak and base flow changes. These issues are discussed throughout the Project fish BA, the fisheries and hydrology sections of the EIS and their various reports developed for this project. Sediment yield calculations are in the Physical Sciences Report and the CWE analysis have largely been maintaining values below the Threshold of Concern except in a few areas where the value exceeds the Threshold pre-Project.  512 Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Aquatic Conservation Strategy Objectives  Effect of treatments from the various action alternatives in relation to the ACS  Water temperature is discussed in the physical sciences report and the fish BA. There will be no anticipated means by which stream temperature will change. Chemical contamination possibilities are extremely limited due to proper application of EEZs, RPMs, and BMPs. No probable measureable effects will occur to water quality at the Project level scale due to the riparian reserve EEZs, the Project RMPs and the BMPs. Shading of water surfaces will not appreciably change due to occasional hazard tree felling within 150 feet of stream channels. Large log wood felled into channels will promote all aspects of this Objective. The prevention of up to 30,000 cubic yards of fine-grained sediment from entering stream courses via the legacy road work site treatments will certainly promote the aspects of this Objective. Project implementation via any of the action alternatives will not prevent attainment of this ACS objective at the Project site scale or in the short term (aided greatly by Project EEZs, BMPs, and RPMs), and meets the objective at the landscape scale and in the intermediate to long-term.  5.) Maintain and restore the sediment regime under which aquatic ecosystems evolved. Elements of the sediment regime include the timing, volume, rate, and character of sediment input, storage, and transport.  Existing Conditions: The sediment regime is in recovery from the initial impacts resulting from the 2015 wildfires, especially in severely burned areas. At a sub-drainage scale (HUC8) the wildfire effects to the smaller hydrologic units are more extreme. Sixty-five percent of the 159 sub-drainages had more than 5% of the area burned at high and moderate severities.  Six percent of these (9 sub-drainages) had more than 50% burn at high and moderate severities.  Six of these were dispersed in different drainages, but 3 of them are in the Chanchelulla –Shiell Gulch drainage that all drain into the Dubakella Sub-drainage in the Upper Hayfork Creek Watershed.   The fire in these areas adversely altered thermal regulation, nutrient filtering and erosion rates at reach scales. The BAER treatments that followed the wildfire accomplished considerable road improvements to reduce erosion and sedimentation rates from the wildfires throughout all watersheds. Existing and Future Activities – (not including this project) The reforestation projects on private and public lands will help to restore watersheds, which should promote improved water quality over the next 30 years as mature forests again redevelop. Project implementation effects in the Physical Science report display the results of a sediment yield analysis per alternative. Although there are measureable quantities of sediment tonnage to be generated at the Project and HUC5-8 scale levels, none of the Project related quantities are large enough to appreciably affect the CWE analysis results and move any HUC5 watershed into a different TOC category.  513 Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Aquatic Conservation Strategy Objectives  Effect of treatments from the various action alternatives in relation to the ACS  Project implementation via any of the action alternatives will not prevent attainment of this ACS objective at the Project site scale or in the short term (aided greatly by Project EEZs, BMPs, and RPMs), and meets the objective at the landscape scale and in the intermediate to long-term. None of the action alternatives would adversely impact the sediment regime at the Project and larger landscape scales. The aquatic ecosystem no doubt has been impacted by the wildfire events and acreages affected pre-Project. Such events are part of the aquatic ecosystem evolution process. The alternatives will not appreciably add to existing post-wildfire enhanced sediment production loads.  6.) Maintain and restore in-stream flows sufficient to create and sustain riparian, aquatic, and wetland habitats, and to retain patterns of sediment, nutrient, and wood routing. The timing, magnitude, duration, and spatial distribution of peak, high and low flows must be protected.  Existing Conditions:  The mainstem Trinity River has an inter-basin transfer that has transported Trinity River water to the Sacramento River Basin since 1963. Unless this diversion is discontinued there is no way to restore instream flows to historic conditions. The South Fork Trinity River however is the largest remaining undammed river in California.  Over the last decade with the increase in cannabis plantations a considerable increase in illegal water drafting has also resulted. Late summer flows have nearly been depleted by this drafting in many of the perennially flowing tributaries. The 2015 wildfires will result in slight increases in adjacent tributary peak flows and are also likely to have augmented low flows as fewer trees are utilizing moisture due to the replacement of living trees with dead trees on large scales..  This increase in flow is negligible in comparison to the flow alterations described above.  This project proposes no new road construction that could otherwise result in surface runoff increases. Legacy road site treatments will decrease the possibility of site diversions at later dates. The most direct way that instream flows could be modified by this project would be during the time it takes to draft water from designated sites long enough to fill water tank vehicles. Both LRMP and NMFS water drafting standards and drafting specifications included as Appendix E in the Project Fish BE will be closely adhered to, which will minimize such impacts to acceptable levels when drafting occurs. Otherwise, there is no aspect of any of the potential action alternatives that could appreciably affect instream flows or the natural hydrographs of such flows. Project implementation via any of the action alternatives will not prevent attainment of this ACS objective at the Project site scale or in the short term (aided greatly by Project EEZs, BMPs, and RPMs), and meets the objective at the landscape scale and in the intermediate to long-term.  514 Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Aquatic Conservation Strategy Objectives  Effect of treatments from the various action alternatives in relation to the ACS  7.) Maintain and restore the  Existing Conditions: floodplains along the mainstem Trinity River have  timing, variability, and duration  experienced impacts from historic mining activities with tailing piles  of floodplain inundation and  stacked throughout portions of them that have dramatically decreased  water table elevation in  flood prone areas. Seeps and springs throughout the areas burned by  meadows and wetlands.  the 2015 wildfires are receiving higher than normal rates of soil saturation due to the loss of mature green trees. Therefore small areas of perennial soil saturation are likely providing additional aquatic habitats that were more limited before the wildfires. Proposed treatments where hazard trees are felled into perennial streams could alter local site patterns of floodplain inundation, water table elevation. However, it would have no effect or only minor effect to existing flow patterns and stream channel conditions. Floodplains, meadows, springs and wetlands are all included within Riparian Reserve designations. No ground disturbing activities would take place within these areas and the proposed activities would not affect timing, variability, and duration of floodplain inundation. Treated areas may have increased soil moisture but not enough to measurably affect water table elevations. Protecting riparian areas as well as not constructing system roads or operating within floodplains would help to maintain existing conditions. Proposed treatments will maintain and restore the variability of floodplain inundation. There will be no effect on wetlands. Project implementation via any of the action alternatives will not prevent attainment of this ACS objective at the Project site scale or in the short term (aided greatly by Project EEZs, BMPs, and RPMs), and meets the objective at the landscape scale and in the intermediate to long-term.  8. Maintain and restore the  Existing Conditions:  The 2015 fires did not significantly alter structural  species composition and  distributions of plant communities in riparian areas with a maximum of  structural diversity of plant  11% of Upper Hayfork Watershed burned at moderate and high burn  communities in riparian areas  severities. At a sub-drainage scale (HUC8) the 2015 wildfire effects to  and wetlands to provide  the hydrologic units are much more pronounced. Sixty-five percent of  adequate summer and winter  the 159 sub-drainages had more than 5% of the area burned at high and  thermal regulation, nutrient  moderate severities.  Six percent of these (9 sub-drainages) had more  filtering, appropriate rates of  than 50% burn at high and moderate severities.  Six of these were  surface erosion, bank erosion,  dispersed in different drainages, but 3 of them are in the Chanchelulla –  and channel migration and to  Shiell Gulch drainage that all drain into the Dubakella Sub-drainage.   The  supply amounts and  fire in these areas adversely altered thermal regulation, nutrient filtering  distributions of coarse woody  and erosion rates at reach scales.  debris sufficient to sustain  physical complexity and stability.  Existing and Future Activities – (not including this project) The reforestation projects of private and public lands will help to  restore the continuity in vegetation along streams restoring the thermal insulation, which will take roughly 30 years to develop shading to pre fire conditions.  515 Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Aquatic Conservation Strategy Objectives  Effect of treatments from the various action alternatives in relation to the ACS  Proposed treatments would not alter the restoration of the species composition and structural diversity of plant communities in untreated areas. Riparian vegetation would be protected as required by resource protection measures and EEZs. Large overstory vegetation would remain intact except where hazard trees are already dead, and would continue to provide thermal regulation. So hazard trees within 150 feet of streams would be felled to become LWD but the healthy trees remain to become future LWD. In the long-term, treatments in riparian reserves are expected to promote the growth of larger conifer and hardwood species already present, resulting in a more diverse forest structure and a source of coarse woody debris. Project activities move treated riparian reserves towards being more resilient to wildfire and maintain riparian processes and function. Project implementation via any of the action alternatives will not prevent attainment of this ACS objective at the Project site scale or in the short term (aided greatly by Project EEZs, BMPs, and RPMs), and meets the objective at the landscape scale and in the intermediate to long-term.  9. Maintain and restore habitat  Existing Conditions: The South Fork Trinity River has a TMDL in place  to support well-distributed  (EPA 1998) to restore aquatic habitat conditions by reducing  populations of native plant,  sedimentation.  The mainstem Trinity River also has a sediment TMDL  invertebrate, and vertebrate  in place (EPA 2001).  The New River Watershed which is a tributary to  riparian-dependent species  the main stem Trinity River is designated as a Key Watershed in the STNF LRMP and is considered as high quality habitat providing refugia for aquatic species. It is also considered a reference watershed that was utilized to set the TMDL and is also clear of mercury issues. Existing and Future Activities – (not including this project) The reforestation projects of private and public lands will help to restore the continuity in vegetation along streams restoring the thermal insulation which will take roughly 30 years to develop shading to pre fire conditions. The proposed treatments in the action alternatives are designed in part to reduce fuel loading and move the fire regime closer to that which occurred historically on the landscape and within riparian reserves. No adverse impacts to aquatic species are expected to occur in or downstream of the Project area as a result of the Project in the short term. Beneficial effects to riparian and aquatic habitat are expected in the long-term. Proposed treatments which include the connected actions of treating legacy sediment sites would contribute to the more immediate restoration of local habitat above and below stream crossings that are improved as a condition of the enrollment of this project under the North Coast Regional Water Quality Waiver. Over the long term these  516 Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Aquatic Conservation Strategy Objectives  Effect of treatments from the various action alternatives in relation to the ACS  actions are expected to support well-distributed populations of riparian-dependent species by increasing habitat continuity, reducing sediment loads and speeding the development of late-successional forest characteristics, including large trees and a multi-story canopy, in the Riparian Reserve areas that would receive fuels treatments. Proposed treatments could cause a very minor short-term reduction in canopy closure in the Riparian Reserve areas having individual hazard trees felled, but any effect on species would be negligible because of the over-riding effect of the residual trees and because of the small proportion of the Riparian Reserve that would be treated. Habitat would be restored spatially and temporally. Project implementation via any of the action alternatives will not prevent attainment of this ACS objective at the Project site scale or in the short term (aided greatly by Project EEZs, BMPs, and RPMs), and meets the objective at the landscape scale and in the intermediate to long-term.  517 Draft Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage APPENDIX F – MAPS Table of Maps Map F-1 Wildfire Complexes, 2015 Map F-2 Land Allocation Map F-3 Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs) and Wild & Scenic Rivers (WSRs) Map F-4 Alternative 1 treatments, Fork Complex Map F-5 Alternative 1 treatments, Mad River Complex Map F-6 Alternative 1 treatments, River Complex Map F-7 Alternative 1 treatments, Route Complex, South Complex, Saddle Fire Map F-8 Alternative 1 treatments, South Complex Map F-9 Alternative 2 treatments, Fork Complex Map F-10 Alternative 2 treatments, Mad River Complex Map F-11 Alternative 2 treatments, River Complex Map F-12 Alternative 2 treatments, Route Complex, South Complex, Saddle Fire Map F-13 Alternative 2 treatments, South Complex Map F-14 Alternative 3 treatments, Fork Complex Map F-15 Alternative 3 treatments, Mad River Complex Map F-16 Alternative 3 treatments, River Complex Map F-17 Alternative 3 treatments, Route Complex, South Complex, Saddle Fire Map F-18 Alternative 3 treatments, South Complex Map F-19 Alternative 4 treatments, Fork Complex Map F-20 Alternative 4 treatments, Mad River Complex Map F-21 Alternative 4 treatments, River Complex Map F-22 Alternative 4 treatments, Route Complex, South Complex, Saddle Fire Map F-23 Alternative 4 treatments, South Complex Map F-24 Alternative 5 treatments, Fork Complex Map F-25 Alternative 5 treatments, Mad River Complex Map F-26 Alternative 5 treatments, River Complex Map F-27 Alternative 5 treatments, Route Complex, South Complex, Saddle Fire Map F-28 Alternative 5 treatments, South Complex Map F-29 Wildland-Urban Interface Map F-30 Watersheds and Riparian Reserves Map F-31 Watersheds and Riparian Reserves, Fork Complex Map F-32 Watersheds and Riparian Reserves, Mad River Complex Map F-33 Watersheds and Riparian Reserves, River Complex Map F-34 Watersheds and Riparian Reserves, Route & South Complexes, Saddle Fire Map F-35 Watersheds and Riparian Reserves, South Complex Note 1: The Forest Service uses the most current and complete data available.

As a result, Maps F-9 and F-10 do not show any fuelbreaks. This is not a mistake. Note 5: Map F-20 shows treatments for Alternative 4. No salvage removal is proposed within the extent of the Mad River complex under Alternative 4; hence, no salvage treatments are shown on this map. This is not a mistake. Shasta-Trinity National Forest  Trinity Alps Wilderness  Six Rivers National Forest  Shasta-Trinity National Forest 2015 Wildfire Complexes -Appendix F Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project Denny Burnt Ranch  Big Bar  Junction City  Weaverville  Hyampom ) Douglas City  Hayfork  Map F -1 Shasta-Trinity NF Chanchelulla Wilderness Mount Lassic Wilderness ) Town State or County Highway Wilderness Fire Perimeter µ National Forest Boundary Date: 1/26/2017 National Forest System Lands Non-National Forest System Lands Document Path: E:\Hazard Reduction EIS Maps\EIS_20170123\Hazard Reduction Extent Map.mxd 0 510Miles Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project -Appendix F Land Allocation Map F -2 Shasta-Trinity NF State or County Highway National Forest Boundary Fire Perimeter National Forest System Lands Non-National Forest System Lands µ Adaptive Management Area Administratively Withdrawn Date: 1/26/2017 Congressionally Reserved Area Late-Successional Reserve Document Path: E:\Hazard Reduction EIS Maps\EIS_20170123\Hazard Reduction Extent Map With Land Allocation.mxd Matrix 0 510Miles Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project -Appendix F Inventoried Roadless Areas and Wild and Scenic Rivers Map F -3 Shasta-Trinity NF Shasta-Trinity Six Rivers National Forest National Forest ) Town Major Highways Fire Perimeter Inventoried Roadless Areas Wild & Scenic River (Designated) µ Wild & Scenic River (Recommended) National Forest Boundary Date: 1/27/2017 National Forest System Lands Non-National Forest System Lands Document Path: E:\Hazard Reduction EIS Maps\EIS_20170123\Hazard Reduction Extent Map With IRA and WSR.mxd 0 510Miles R12 W Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project -Appendix F Map F -4 Alternative 1;
